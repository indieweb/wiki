'''<dfn>otp</dfn>''' (or OTP) is an acronym for <dfn>on the phone</dfn> which you might see appended with an underscore separator on an [[IRC]] nickname to indicate that their attention is currently divided (preoccupied) with a [[phone]] call and they might not respond to queries in IRC.

It can also mean <dfn>[[Time-based One-time Password Algorithm | one time password]]</dfn>, which may be used for [[indieauth]].
