'''<dfn>[https://omg.lol/ omg.lol]</dfn>''' is a [[web hosting]] platform on which you can build a web presence, offering features like hosting a simple landing page, email forwarding, and URL redirection, and a community around the product.

== Features ==
* bring your own domain! omg.lol can be used as a service host for your own domain, thus allowing you to own your permalinks etc and have the option to [[migrate]] elsewhere without breaking anything on your site.
* [[rel=me]] verification by default on its link page builder.
* subdomains: omg.lol is on the [https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat public suffix list] and while it allows you to define DNS records you won't be able to transfer the subdomain to another provider.
** You should use your own domain however, instead of a <nowiki>subdomain.omg.lol</nowiki>
* Other services
** The omg.lol service offers companion services like [https://status.lol status.lol] which offer more services useful in building a web presence.

== How to ==
=== How to setup a domain ===
omg.lol does support bringing [[personal-domain|your own domain]] though doing so requires configuring your own [[DNS provider]] as well as telling omg.lol what page your domain should point to on omg.lol. omg.lol refers to personal domains as "External Domains".

Their longer documentation on this is:
