'''<dfn>[https://omg.lol/ omg.lol]</dfn>''' is a [[web hosting]] platform on which you can build a web presence, offering features like hosting a simple landing page, email forwarding, and URL redirection, and a community around the product.

== IndieWeb Friendly ==
Omg.lol has a number of features that are IndieWeb-friendly or IndieWeb-adjacent:
* bring your own domain! omg.lol can be used as a service host for your own domain, thus allowing you to own your permalinks etc and have the option to [[migrate]] elsewhere without breaking anything on your site.
* [[rel=me]] verification by default on its link page builder.
* [[h-card]] support on profiles see: https://adam.omg.lol

== Features ==
* subdomains: omg.lol is on the [https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat public suffix list] and while it allows you to define DNS records you won't be able to transfer the subdomain to another provider.
** You should use your own domain however, instead of a <nowiki>subdomain.omg.lol</nowiki>
* Other services
** The omg.lol service offers companion services like [https://status.lol status.lol] which offer more services useful in building a web presence.

== Non-features ==
Omg.lol has also declared at least one non-feature:
* "No AI" (e.g. [[LLM]]s) in their services: https://social.lol/@prami/112479667213605913 <blockquote><p>"🤫 Hey. Psst. Guess what.</p><p>There’s no AI in omg.lol, and there never will be.</p><p>It’s just real humans with real hearts here, building and connecting and socializing. Exchanging *our* ideas, not ideas harvested from a model. Creating *our* own things, not watching something else build them for us.</p><p>The web that humans built 30 years ago is still here for us to use and enjoy together today. Some may try to suck out its soul and replace it with the latest shiny thing, but not here. Never here. ❤️🫂"</p><cite style="display:block;text-align:right">[https://social.lol/@prami @prami] May 21, 2024</cite>

== How to ==
=== How to setup a domain ===
omg.lol does support bringing [[personal-domain|your own domain]] though doing so requires configuring your own [[DNS provider]] as well as telling omg.lol what page your domain should point to on omg.lol. omg.lol refers to personal domains as "External Domains".

Their longer documentation on this is:
* '''External Domains''' section on https://home.omg.lol/info/switchboard
