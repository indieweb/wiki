== Suggestions ==
* Try to get an interview on Redecentralize.org. Suggested by [[User:Robin.millette.info]] in IRC[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-02/line/1422900095101]
** Anecdotally, I found redecentralize.org before indiewebcamp.com &mdash; when I asked around about the state of FOSS social networks, lots of people pointed me there. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 11:21, 2 February 2015 (PST)

=== Best Practices ===
In order to avoid the feeling of harassment or other negative feelings that can be experienced on social media when you get singled out by a person or group of people, we should avoid certain behaviors when doing outreach for the IndieWeb.
* If you try to engage someone about IndieWeb once and they don’t respond or engage back positively, interpret that as they aren’t interested and don’t continue to reach out to them until they initiate back to you.
* If a tweet is seen in an IndieWeb chat room, check its responses before responding yourself. If someone else said something similar to what you want to say or if 2-3 people have already responded, know that they have been engaged and don’t respond yourself. While we all have good intentions, receiving a dozen unsolicited tweets unexpectedly can come off very overwhelming for most people.
