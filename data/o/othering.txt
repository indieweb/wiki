'''<dfn>othering</dfn>''' is the artificial dichotomy framing of two sets of people as "us" vs "them", something we should try to avoid or at least minimize on the indieweb per our [[principles]] (in particular [[plurality]]) and [[code-of-conduct]].

A technological  example of this is offering gender options male/female/other, instead of a free text field, making it clear that they are for marketing purposes, not self-expression.
