'''<dfn>othering</dfn>''' is the artificial dichotomy framing of two sets of people as "us" vs "them", something we should try to avoid or at least minimize on the indieweb per our [[principles]] (in particular [[plurality]]) and [[code-of-conduct]].

A literal (theoretical? screenshots needed) example of this is when a site's profile editing UI has a gender menu with three options like "male/female/other", instead of a free text field, literally "other"ing anyone with a non-binary gender.

Why? Because gender-nonconforming people are othered enough as it is.</blockquote>
