{{stub}}

'''<dfn>outbound link wrapper</dfn>''' is a domain and service used by a site (like [[social media]] silos) to create  links from that site to other sites, using that domain for such links instead of the URL to the actual link to another site.

Some outbound link wrapper are also link shorteners.

== Examples ==
* [[href.li]] used by [[Tumblr]] and [[WordPress.com]]
* l.facebook.com/l.php used by [[Facebook]]
* [[t.co]] used by [[Twitter]]
* ... Instagram
* ... Google

== Criticism ==
=== Breaks Webmentions ===
Like [[link shortener]]s in general, the use of outbound link wrappers breaks the sending of Webmentions from those sites, since webmention receivers are unable to verify that the source actually contains the target link.
