<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Open Search Design</dfn>''' is a discussion about ways in which the component pieces of search engines (i.e. crawler, indexer, and web UI) can be developed separately and link together.</span> 

== Why design open search projects? ==

Good search engines need to solve a lot of problems to provide relevant, accurate, and appropriate results to users. When you visit a search engine, you are looking for a quick result that meets your intent, without having to click through many spam links, outdated posts, or other pieces of irrelevant material.

Solving problems like relevance takes a lot of work and many parts of search are their own fields entirely. With a distributed approach, those interested in search could create systems that encouraged open participation from others so as to create an environment where collective contributions would help advance search as a whole.

== How ==

There are many areas of search that could be made open or distributed, including:

* Crawling, where an indexing service agrees on a distributed system through which people who want to show their content on the search engine can submit a crawled version of their site.
* User interface representation, where a search engine has an open index that can then be built on top of by other parties.
* Relevance algorithms, where a search engine provides an open index that can then be queried using custom algorithms.

Search has traditionally been taken on by individual businesses (i.e. Google, Yahoo, Yandex) so the vocabulary and exploration around ways in which search could be distributed or designed to support open programmatic access requires deep discussion.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== IndieWeb Search ===

* {{jamesgoca}} is building [[IndieWeb Search]] in the open on GitHub. The search engine is marked up with h-feeds and has an API that returns direct answers and search results. This creates a system upon which custom search UIs could easily be built.
** More exploration is needed in terms of how the search engine can be made more open. How could IndieWeb search accept crawls from other community members? How would these crawls be validated?

== Criticism ==

The term "open search" may be confusing as it is reminiscent of the OpenSearch specification.

== Brainstorm ==
