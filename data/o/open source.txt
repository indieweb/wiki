'''<dfn>Open source</dfn>''' also known as '''<dfn>free software</dfn>''', '''<dfn>OSS</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>FLOSS</dfn>''' in the IndieWeb refers to both a set of [[projects]] where community members share their creations (often, but not limited to software) in a way that allows for collaboration, and an imperative from our [[principles]] encouraging public sharing of code, designs, and content for re-use by others in and beyond the community.

== Why ==
Open sourcing at least part of your IndieWeb project is a great way to enable & encourage asynchronous feedback from the rest of the community. 

Your code may be useful as a reference for others who are implementing similar functionality or [[standards]] support.

By separating at least some of your code into an open source library, you may provide a [[building block]] that many other developers can use to more rapidly implement similar applications or features.

== How to ==
=== How to open source a project ===
Before you open source a project, you should make sure that any proprietary (non-open source) code that you would like to keep to yourself is separate from the code you open source. You should also:

* [https://choosealicense.com Choose a license for your code]
* Remove any sensitive information
* Write a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README README] that explains your project and how it works

Ideally you should open source your code on your own site, and share it where others may easily re-use it. This could mean anything from offering an compressed archive (such as a zip file) of source code on your own site to hosting your own [[:Category:Software Forge|software forge]].

=== How to encourage contributions ===
If you would like others to contribute to your project, consider adding a [[CONTRIBUTING.md|CONTRIBUTING]] file that outlines how people can add bugfixes and new features to your project, and a [[CODE OF CONDUCT.md|CODE_OF_CONDUCT]] file that outlines the social and behavioral expectations around your project.

Many IndieWeb community members publish open source projects on [[GitHub]]. GitHub has wide adoption in the developer community and an extensive range of interactive, intuitive tools that you can use to collaborate on projects together.

== Open for contributions ==
There are [[Template:Open Source|many open-source IndieWeb projects]] which encourage and support contributions. The [[IndieWeb Hackathon]] is a recurring event highlighting projects seeking contributions. See also [[:Category:Projects that need maintenance]]

== Community Members Writing Open Source Code ==

== Participating in IndieWeb Standard Development ==

Members of the IndieWeb community have contributed to, written, and edited various [[standards]]. If you implement a standard on your site and want to get involved with it, you can do so by open sourcing your code, writing about your implementation, and/or sharing your thoughts about the standard and what it allows you to do.

The IndieWeb community maintains an [https://github.com/indieweb IndieWeb GitHub account] where you can file feature requests and issues that relate to standards. Sharing your ideas about how a standard can be improved will aid its development even if the standard is mature. Our community standards, including those that are stable, all benefit from hearing developers' experience implementing them. Sharing your thoughts will help the community figure out how standards can be improved.
