'''<dfn>Open source</dfn>''' refers to source code that is publicly available to read and potentially contribute to, and is a popular way in which many IndieWeb community members share their code and collaborate on building [[projects]] together.

== Why ==

Open sourcing an IndieWeb project you are working on means you can easily facilitate feedback on the implementation details behind your project from the rest of the community. Your code may also be useful as a reference point who is implementing something you have already thought about and written in code.

If you write an open source library, you have the potential to write code that many other people can use to build applications that meet their needs faster.

== How ==

Many IndieWeb community members publish open source projects on [[GitHub]], a popular code-hosting silo. GitHub has wide adoption in the developer community and an extensive range of interactive, intuitive tools that you can use to collaborate on projects together.

Before you open source a project, you should make sure that any proprietary code that you would like to keep to yourself is separate from the code you open source. You should also:

* Choose a license for your code
* Remove any sensitive information
* Write a README that explains your project and how it works

Further down the line, you might want to write a CONTRIBUTING file that outlines how people can contribute to your project.

== Open Source Open for Contributions ==

There are many open-source IndieWeb projects to which you can contribute.

Here are a few, broken down by programming language:

=== Python ===

* [[mf2py]], the Python microformats parser.
* [[IndieWeb_Utils]], a Python library that makes it easy to add IndieWeb building blocks to your web application
* [[brid.gy]], the POSSE and backfeed as a service tool.
* [[granary]], the social web translator tool.
