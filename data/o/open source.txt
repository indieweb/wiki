'''<dfn>Open source</dfn>''' in the IndieWeb refers to both a set of [[projects]] where community members share their creations (usually code, <dfn>open source software</dfn>, or <dfn><abbr>OSS</abbr></dfn>) to collaborate & build together, and an imperative from our [[principles]] encouraging public sharing of code, designs, and content for re-use by others in and beyond the community.

== Why ==
Open sourcing at least part of your IndieWeb project is a great way to enable & encourage asynchronous feedback from the rest of the community. 

Your code may be useful as a reference for others who are implementing similar functionality or [[standards]] support.

By separating at least some of your code into an open source library, you may provide a [[building block]] that many other developers can use to more rapidly implement similar applications or features.

== How to ==
=== How to open source a project ===
Before you open source a project, you should make sure that any proprietary code that you would like to keep to yourself is separate from the code you open source. You should also:

* Choose a license for your code
* Remove any sensitive information
* Write a README that explains your project and how it works

Further down the line, you might want to write a CONTRIBUTING file that outlines how people can contribute to your project.

Ideally you should open source your code on your own site, and share it where others may easily re-use it.

Many IndieWeb community members publish open source projects on [[GitHub]]. GitHub has wide adoption in the developer community and an extensive range of interactive, intuitive tools that you can use to collaborate on projects together.

== Open for contributions ==
There are many open-source IndieWeb projects which encourage and support contributions.

Here are a few, clustered by programming language:

=== JavaScript ===
* [https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/mf2tojf2 mf2tojf2], converts MF2 to JF2.
* [[Indiekit]], a Micropub server that currently supports git based static sites
* [[CASSIS]], a library and set of utilities for some common internal functionality on IndieWeb sites

=== PHP ===
* [[CASSIS]], as long as you’re willing to write JS-compatible PHP syntax.
* [[indiewebify.me]], a website that helps people get started with the IndieWeb and test their implementations of various basic [[building blocks]].

=== Python ===
* [[mf2py]], the Python microformats parser.
* [[IndieWeb_Utils]], a Python library that makes it easy to add IndieWeb building blocks to your web application
* [[brid.gy]], the POSSE and backfeed as a service tool.
* [[granary]], the social web translator tool.
* [[IndieWeb Search]], a web crawler, interface, and search back-end. This project indexes IndieWeb and related websites and makes them searchable.
