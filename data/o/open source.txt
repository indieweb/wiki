'''<dfn>Open source</dfn>''' in the IndieWeb refers to both a set of [[projects]] where community members share their code to collaborate & build together, and is also an imperative in our [[principles]] encouraging public sharing of code, designs, and content for re-use by others in and beyond the community.

== Why ==
Open sourcing an IndieWeb project you are working on means you can easily facilitate feedback on the implementation details behind your project from the rest of the community. Your code may also be useful as a reference point who is implementing something you have already thought about and written in code.

If you write an open source library, you have the potential to write code that many other people can use to build applications that meet their needs faster.

== How to ==
=== How to open source a project ===
Before you open source a project, you should make sure that any proprietary code that you would like to keep to yourself is separate from the code you open source. You should also:

* Choose a license for your code
* Remove any sensitive information
* Write a README that explains your project and how it works

Further down the line, you might want to write a CONTRIBUTING file that outlines how people can contribute to your project.

Ideally you should open source your code on your own site, and share it where others may easily re-use it.

Many IndieWeb community members publish open source projects on [[GitHub]]. GitHub has wide adoption in the developer community and an extensive range of interactive, intuitive tools that you can use to collaborate on projects together.


== Open for contributions ==
There are many open-source IndieWeb projects which encourage and support contributions.

Here are a few, clustered by programming language:

=== JavaScript ===
* [https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/mf2tojf2 mf2tojf2], converts MF2 to JF2.
* [[Indiekit]], a Micropub server that currently supports git based static sites

=== PHP ===
* [[CASSIS]], a library and set of utilities for some common internal functionality on IndieWeb sites

=== Python ===
* [[mf2py]], the Python microformats parser.
* [[IndieWeb_Utils]], a Python library that makes it easy to add IndieWeb building blocks to your web application
* [[brid.gy]], the POSSE and backfeed as a service tool.
* [[granary]], the social web translator tool.

=== Ruby ===
* Add examples...
