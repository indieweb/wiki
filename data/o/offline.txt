'''<dfn>offline</dfn>''' is anytime you're not online and connected to the internet; on the IndieWeb, a personal site can have offline support by implementing an [[offline first]] approach.

It's similar to intermittent connectivity, like using a network with high latency or packet loss, but obviously not quite the same.

An ''[[offline first]]'' design pattern is emerging, especially for mobile (web)apps, in the same vein as mobile first or notification/text first design. The pattern is to design an app with offline as the primary use case, so that features work offline as much as possible, then add network sync and features that require connectivity as optional extras.

== Why ==
People are often places without an internet connection, however they may have previously browsed your site when online. Offline support can provide a friendlier experience on your site when readers are browsing it without an internet connection, such as explicitly informing them when a page is unavailable, and providing them with a list of your pages that they previously browsed (like blog posts) that they can read while offline.

== How to ==
=== Offline page ===
Perhaps the simplest bit of user visible offline support is an explicit offline page, so when a user is offline and browses to a page on your site that is not cached, they will see a friendlier message from you about being offline instead of the default browser "network unavailable" error message.

In {{adactio}}â€™s [https://adactio.com/journal/13540 Minimal viable service worker] article, he links to an example minimum viable service worker that also has offline page support (from the 2018 Ampersand event site). Using that example, follow these steps to create a custom offline page and service worker to support it:

# Start with a minimal static offline page, like the Ampersand event site offline page:
#* https://2018.ampersandconf.com/offline/
# Customize it for your own site (e.g. with your site banner and footer) and save it somewhere like <kbd>offline.html</kbd>.
# Use a minimal service worker that has explicit offline page support built-in like:
#* https://2018.ampersandconf.com/serviceworker.js
# Customize it at least as follows:
#* Update the offlinePage variable to point to your offline page path, e.g. if you put offline.html at the root of your site, then use <code>"/offline.html"</code>.
#* Update the <code>cache.addAll</code> block with resources you want to optionally pre-cache, like perhaps your home page and home page CSS file.
#* ...

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Quill ===
As of 2015-05-09, [[Quill]] supports offline editing, but will only let you have one offline draft. The post is saved in the browser's local storage while editing, so you can edit offline, close the browser, and when you get back online you can return to Quill and publish the post.

=== Teacup ===
As of November 2018, a special version of [[Teacup]] is available as an offline-first app. Creating a post will store the post locally and sync when the device is back online.

== IndieWeb thoughts ==
Mobile [[micropub]] clients are examples of apps that should ideally work offline as well as online. {{snarfed}}'s post ''[https://snarfed.org/posting-to-the-indieweb-from-your-phone Posting to the indieweb from your phone]'' describes one straw man design for this.

Brainstorming for offline features for a personal site
=== Offline Reading of Posts ===
* {{kartikprabhu}} enable offline reading of posts using a [[service worker]]. When you visit my site, it allows you to cache some article offline. then later you can read my article without network. can also be implemented for [[readers]] though. could also be useful in [[micropub]] clients for saving drafts of posts offline, so you can write your post without connection (also known as a [[local first]] approach), then sync/publish when you get back the network

== App examples ==
=== in general ===
==== text editor ====
Make sure you have a simple text editor on whatever device you're using offline. Since such apps rarely use any network access for anything anyway, they are ideal for offline usage. E.g.
* iOS: Notes app

=== iOS ===
Apps specific to iOS that work very well offline.
==== maps.me ====
maps.me is an excellent offline map program. You have to download the ([[OSM]]-based) maps per state/province BEFORE you go offline, but then once you're offline, it can still:
* show you the map (including zoom in etc., street names etc.)
* locate you on the map (via wifi-SSID location db which is already on the device)
* search the map
* do simple car-based route-planning
