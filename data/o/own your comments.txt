{{stub}}

'''<dfn>own your comments</dfn>''' is the IndieWeb approach of accepting [[Webmention]]s and in particular from [[reply]] posts as part of collecting all the [[responses]] to your posts on your own site so if/when the original reply posts disappear, you still have a copy of the conversation.

* Note: this is particularly important because many silo exports (e.g. [[Medium]]) do not export the comments on your posts per [https://m.signalvnoise.com/signal-v-noise-exits-medium/ Signal v Noise exits Medium] <blockquote>sad to say, Medium didnâ€™t let us export the comments, so those are gone ðŸ˜¢</blockquote>
