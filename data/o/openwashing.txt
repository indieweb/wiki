'''<dfn>openwashing</dfn>''' is the dark practice of producing something with non-open methods, then claiming it is open, or marketing it as open, with perhaps superficial resemblance or motions that appear to make it open, but not open in practice, whether open [[standards]], open [[projects|source]], open licensing, etc.

== Classes of examples ==
* "Open APIs" - most so-called Open APIs have very restrictive or domineering Terms of Service that make them non-open in practice
* ...
