'''<dfn>Own your links</dfn>''' is the concept of creating links on your own website that redirect to other properties you own, for instance social media accounts or content you have created on other websites.

== How ==

To "own" a link, you should:

* Come up with the name for your link and identify where it is going to point.
** (i.e. example.com/github/ could point to github.com/<yourprofilename>)
* Create a redirect on your site that points the name of your link to the destination.
* Use your link when referring to the resource to which your link points.

For instance, Alice may create a page on her site with the URL example.com/twitter/. Alice uses this URL to link to her Twitter account rather than her main Twitter URL.

== Why ==

By owning a link, you can change its destination as appropriate without having to rely on the owner of the site to which a link points setting up redirects if the link destination changes.

This may be useful if you change your profile name on a social media service. If someone takes your old profile name and you always link directly to your profile, people may not find the content to which you were linking when you first created the link.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
