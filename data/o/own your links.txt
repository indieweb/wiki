'''<dfn>Own your links</dfn>''' is the concept of creating links on your own website that redirect to other properties you own, for instance social media accounts or content you have created on other websites.

== Why ==
By owning a link, you can change its destination as appropriate without having to rely on the owner of the site to which a link points setting up redirects if the link destination changes.

This may be useful if you change your profile name on a social media service. If someone takes your old profile name and you always link directly to your profile, people may not find the content to which you were linking when you first created the link.

Google site-specific searches with your site, will show content from sites you have setup such redirects for!

== How to ==

To "own" a link, you should:

* Come up with the name for your link and identify where it is going to point.
** (i.e. example.com/github/ could point to github.com/<yourprofilename>)
* Create a redirect on your site that points the name of your link to the destination.
* Use your link when referring to the resource to which your link points.

For instance, Alice may create a page on her site with the URL example.com/twitter/. Alice uses this URL to link to her Twitter account rather than her main Twitter URL.

=== How to Apache htaccess ===
If you use [[Apache]] with [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_alias.html mod_alias] enabled and can access your .htaccess file, you can add an instruction like

<code><nowiki>RedirectTemp /github https://github.com/yourGHusername</nowiki></code>

replacing "yourGHusername" with your GitHub username.

=== How to nginx config ===

You can use the following [[nginx]] config to own a link:

<pre><nowiki>
location ~ ^/github/(.*) {
     return 307 https://github.com/yourGHusername/$1;
}
</nowiki></pre>

replacing "yourGHusername" with your GitHub username.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} owns his links for:
* PBWorks homepage & individual pages [http://tantek.com/2010/264/t1/activitystreams-object-type-filter-falcon-feed since at least 2010-09-21] with tantek.com, and [http://tantek.com/2010/205/t2/short-url-thoughts-design-whistle since 2010-07-24] with his shortdomain ttk.me.

* GitHub profile & repos [https://tantek.com/2021/084/t1/ownyourlinks-indieweb-github-redirect since at least 2021-03-25]

Both of which show up in Google site-scoped searches as if theyâ€™re on his domain! E.g. 
* [https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Atantek.com+%22tantek.com%2Fgithub%2Fcassis%22 Google search for site:tantek.com "tantek.com/github/cassis"] (first result is content from Github.com and third result is content from PBWorks, shown in results as if they are on tantek.com)
