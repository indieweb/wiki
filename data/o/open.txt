'''"<dfn>Open</dfn>"''' is a way of describing something as being more accessible: more accessible to more people, more accessible on more devices, etc.

== Examples ==
* The [[MacOS|Mac]] is "more open" than [[Linux]] because it is more open to more people being able to productively use it, as opposed to requiring users meet a bar of becoming a Linux sysadmin.
* [[Slack]] is "more open" than [[Hipchat]] because of the well-designed [[mobile]], web, and desktop apps, as well as the ease of integrating external sources.

== See Also ==
* [[open web]]
* [[open standards]]
* [[Matrix]] is a [[federation|federated]] alternative to [[Slack]] designed to offer an extensible [[open]] superset of common [[chat]] protocols so it can be used as a lowest common denominator for a [[bridge all the things|universal bridge]]
