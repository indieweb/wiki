'''<dfn>[https://opencollective.com/ open collective]</dfn>''' is a service for collecting donations and transparently tracking how the money is used. The IndieWeb community currently uses it to track our donations and spending: https://opencollective.com/indieweb

If you are organizing an IndieWebCamp, you can request reimbursement from the donation pool for things like food for the event. Here's how to request to be reimbursed for an IndieWeb community expense: https://opencollective.com/faq#expense. The IndieWeb's collective page is https://opencollective.com/indieweb.
