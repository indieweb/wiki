'''<dfn>own your data</dfn>''' is an IndieWeb [[principles|principle]] with two key parts: 1) your data lives primarily under your own [[domain]], and 2) you are able to [[export|retain your access]] over time.

== Why ==

First, using your own domain gives you [[why#Control_and_agency|control]] over where people find and interact with you online. When you migrate to a new [[web_hosting|hosting provider]] or [[CMS]], if your site stays on the same domain, everyone will still find you, regardless of whether they follow your site in a [[reader]], land directly on your [[permalinks]] from other sites or search engines, or even type your domain directly into a browser.

Second, they say that ''change is the only constant'', and web sites are no exception. Whether you stick with a [[web_hosting|host]] or [[CMS]] for a year, a decade, or a century, you're likely to change something eventually. When you do, you'll need usable access to all of your existing data. This includes [[export]] and [[import]], data [[formats]] and [[standards]], [[projects|tools]], [[protocols]], permissions, rate limits, and more.

Also see '''[[why]]'''.

== How ==
=== The Basics ===
See and follow these in order:
* [[Getting Started]]
* [[IndieMark]]
__TOC__
=== Per Silo ===
Commit to owning your data by using your site, instead of a silo, for each silo you currently use. 

Each silo you stop directly using ([[POSSE]] is ok), and use your own site instead, is a step forward in owning your data.

=== Per Post Type ===
Commit to owning each kind of post you publish, by using <em>only</em> your site to publish particular [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|kinds of posts]] (again, [[POSSE]] is ok).

Each kind of post you stop posting directly to <em>any/all</em> silo(s), and use always use your own site to create instead, is a step forward in owning your data.

=== Per Post Type Per Silo ===
A more incremental but still significant step is stop posting a particular type of post to a particular silo, and always use your own site to publish that type of post instead of that silo.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

Add yourself here if you:
* have an indieweb site, and 
* are using it '''exclusively''' to post either 
** a particular kind of [[post]] (e.g. [[notes]]), and/or 
** if you are posting to your site completely '''instead of''' a particular [[silo]] (e.g. [[Twitter]])
and note what date you started '''owning your data''' of what kind(s) of posts, or instead of which silo(s).

For the purpose of this page, please succinctly list, <em>only</em>
* '''specific silo(s)''' you have replaced usage of with your own site. E.g.: I use my own site instead of Twitter (notes, replies, favorites)
* '''post type(s)''' you use your own site for instead of / before any silo posts. E.g.: I post notes on my own site instead of Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc.
* '''post type(s) instead of specific silo''' - what post type you use your own site for instead of / before a specific silo. E.g.: I post notes & replies on my own site instead of Twitter.

Optional details, for each of the above post types / or "instead of silos", optionally note which [[projects]] or tools help you do so.

'''Examples of what doesn't count:'''
* You post some notes on your own site, and some notes directly to [[Twitter]].
** Why: All or nothing. Either you've committed and are following through with posting <em>all</em> your content of a specific kind to your own site, or you don't yet "own your data" of that type.

'''Examples of what belongs on your user page instead:'''
* owned other things besides post types / instead of silos (sites, domain names, project installs)
* what other sites you post to

'''Examples of what doesn't disqualify you:'''
* A small number of '''test''' posts on any given silo of any given content type, especially if you're doing it as research for how to best [[POSSE]] to that silo, especially if you <em>document</em> the results of your research here on the wiki. Though for research purposes, you really should create one or more separate test accounts on silos.

Notes: 
* '''not yet ownyourreplies.''' I can't say I yet I follow "ownyourdata" for ALL my replies, as I still post replies directly to [[Instagram]] posts, and the past have posted replies directly to posts on [[Facebook]] (stopped in 2020), whereas I should be posting even those replies on my own site first, and then POSSEing them to Facebook manually. Thus I've scoped my "ownyourdata" of replies to only being a replacement for my use of Twitter and GitHub to post replies.
* '''not yet ownyourlikes.''' I also can't yet say I follow "ownyourdata" for ALL my likes, as I still like photos directly on [[Instagram]], and posts on [[Facebook]] (stopped in 2020).
* '''not yet ownyourRSVPs.''' While I have owned my public [[RSVP]]s (especially "going") since 2017-01-01, I still RSVP to private events on Facebook. I’m not sure how to avoid this short of giving up on private FB events. I also have been clicking the "I’m Going" on [https://events.indieweb.org/ IndieWeb HWC Events pages] without always posting an RSVP on my own site.
* '''not yet ownyourissues.''' While I’ve owned 100% of my public issues posted to GitHub, I still post issues directly (and without my own copy) to [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ Bugzilla].
* '''no private posts yet.''' I don't have a mechanism for publishing [[private post]]s yet, so I am still manually posting those elsewhere, like [[Swarm]] [[checkin]]s, comments, and likes, and private GitHub repos for example.

== Hashtag ==
'''#<dfn>ownyourdata</dfn>''' is a rallying cry hashtag for aggregating content across indie web sites and 3rd-party [[silos]] about "owning your data", "owning your own data" etc.

* [http://tagboard.com/ownyourdata Tagboard: #ownyourdata] - hashtag aggregator across [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Google]]+.
* [https://www.google.com/search?q=ownyourdata&tbm=nws Google News Search: ownyourdata]

<nowiki>#ownyourdata</nowiki> posts tend to be a a subset of [[Posts about the IndieWeb]].

== Criticism ==

Following a discussion [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2020-11-19#t1605826653425200] between {{aaronpk}} and {{petermolnar}} that was triggered by specific wording found in an indiweb critic post [https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?ascraeus.org/0/phlog/041.txt], namely the sentence: 
    Legally, any and all content that you post to a silo is no  longer  "your  content"

* {{aaronpk}}: https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870?ref=dp "We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it" 
* [...]
* {{aaronpk}}: giving up your ownership means you can no longer do things with it yourself such as giving other people licenses 
* [...]
* {{petermolnar}}: one would assume [...] owning == option to grant and to revoke rights/access
* {{petermolnar}}: and with sending it to a silo, the revoking part is, most of the times, thrown away
* {{petermolnar}}: hence "owning" from that point on, is incomplete(?)

As pointed out by Twitter user @dox_gay, hardcore porn is now embedded on the pages of the Huffington Post, New York magazine, The Washington Post, and a host of other websites.
