The '''<dfn>object-oriented-programming antipattern</dfn>''' is the excessive / unnecessary use of object-oriented-programming (OOP) and OOP techniques when simple procedural functions would have sufficed, with less overhead, fewer files to navigate around, fewer indirections to follow while debugging, etc.

* Criticism: wastes too much time compared to actual utility (for both library creators/maintainers, and clients). OOP encourages lots of time to be spent (wasted) with setting up a ton of boilerplate files (naming is hard), classes (naming is hard), methods (naming is hard), hierarchy (information architecture is hard), when a flat set of functions would suffice for 90%+ of use-cases, and the best way to discover that other 10% is to start flat and then only add hierarchy when the flat set of things gets too large and you need some "chunking" to make it easier to navigate.
