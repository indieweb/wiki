'''<dfn>office hours</dfn>''' is a practice of being available for serendipitous but structured professional, mentoring, or knowledge sharing oriented introductions, possibly on video and or opening a calendar service to invites, though there are no known IndieWeb examples of people doing so with their own sites.

This can be particularly well supported by including instructions or links on your personal website for how to schedule, what kind of topics you might discuss, what to expect, and anything else people should know.
