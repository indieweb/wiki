{{stub}}

'''<dfn>office hours</dfn>''' is a practice of being available for serendipitous but structured professional, mentoring, or knowledge sharing oriented introductions, typically on a video meeting, to people usually by opening one's calendar app to invites.

This can be particularly well supported by including instructions or links on your personal website for how to schedule, what kind of topics you might discuss, what to expect, and anything else people should know.
