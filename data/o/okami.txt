== Media ==

=== problems ===
* I take photos with my phone and digital camera and I don't always have time to post / organize so they end up living on the device for months/years waiting for me to sort them out.
* I also have a backlog of ~10 years worth of photos that I want to organise and post to my site.

=== Ideal workflow ===
* take a bunch of photos/videos
* backup media from device to media endpoint
* use okami to view all media uploaded to the media endpoint and to a post
* Would be great if my media server could know which media has been added to my site. Current thinking is that I can webmention the media URL and the media server can use that to mark the media as published


== Geo ==

=== problems ===

I have ~2 years worth of gpx logs that I want to do something with

=== ideal workflow ===

* Walk around with my phone collecting gpx data
* backup gpx data to a Micropub Geo server.
* Geo server parses gpx logs into suggestions for posts (checkins, trips)
* Use okami to view and act on suggestions from geo server
