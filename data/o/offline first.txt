'''<dfn>offline first</dfn>''' is a method of developing a website that once a user has visited it once on their device, it will always provide at least some content ([[posts]]) and or features (like [[creating]] posts) when they revisit even when [[offline]] without internet access, using technologies like Service Workers and Local Storage.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Jeremy Keith ===
* {{adactio}}’s primary website: https://adactio.com/ has offline first support so it works when you reload it when you're offline, and can even read some of the articles (whatever it happened to cache from before, including what you browsed)
* {{adactio}}’s book "Resilient Web Design" is an entire offline first website: https://resilientwebdesign.com/
