'''<dfn>offline first</dfn>''' is a method of developing a website that once a user has visited it once on their device, it will always provide at least some content ([[posts]]) and or features (like [[creating]] posts) when they revisit even when [[offline]] without internet access, using technologies like Service Workers and Local Storage.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Jeremy Keith ===
* {{adactio}}’s primary website: https://adactio.com/ has offline first support so it works when you reload it when you're offline, and can even read some of the articles (whatever it happened to cache from before, including what you browsed)
* {{adactio}}’s book "Resilient Web Design" is an entire offline first website: https://resilientwebdesign.com/

** "I had an old computer at home, and so to continue playing with this magic, I’d take floppy disks, and sneaker-net my HTML files back and forth - working on them offline in a text editor, and then uploading them and researching a bunch of new magic when I was online. /12" [https://twitter.com/bengoodger @bengoodger] November 30, 2021
