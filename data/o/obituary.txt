An '''<dfn>obituary</dfn>''' is an article reporting on the death of a person and usually includes an account of their life and information about their funeral arrangements.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [http://brianna.org Brianna Privett] built a [http://annetteprivett.com/ remembrance site for her mother]. She discussed it at WordCampUS in December 2017.([https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14fAzIdLrfKt6K313UraEJATFsjFsqTEumNun4ufhtiU/edit#slide=id.g2ae5c89802_0_20 slide 24])
<blockquote>When my mom died, I wrote her obituary and placed it in the local newspaper. Legacy.com reposted it and gave visitors a commenting function - but only for a year. When I discovered over four pages of comments from friends and family on my momâ€™s Legacy.com obituary page were about to be lost, I created a site for her with WordPress and the Hemingway Reloaded theme. I posted updates, including an MP3 of her voicemail greeting, and people whose lives she touched still post comments to this day.</blockquote>

== Silo Examples ==
* [http://legacy.com Legacy.com] is a silo service that takes obituaries from local newspapers and allows mourners to post memories of their loved ones. As a paid service they maintain memorial websites on an ongoing basis. They allow people to post [[notes]], [[photos]], and [[videos]] as well as creating some brief [[identity]] information for deceased loved ones. They also have a custom post type allowing visitors to [[light a candle]], which is essentially a [[note]] with an attached [[photo]] of a candle.
