=== Downtime 2016-09 ===
Lanyrd appears to have been down for at least part of the weekend of 2016-09-04 per https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/status/772432792529539072 <blockquote>Lanyrd disappearing all weekend has prompted me to work on adding speaking stuff to my own site. Amazing how much data I didn’t ‘own’.</blockquote>
