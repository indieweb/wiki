== Proposed New Logo ==

I created a new logo (below) based on the current one (with a few versions for different usage).
I wrote up an article about my reasons, my process and iterations and how I came to my final second proposed version. (The logotype "#INDIEWEBCAMP" still needs work.)

=== Alternative Proposal ===

A few months ago, Andi Galpern [https://twitter.com/andigalpern/status/694939629175332864 mocked up] an updated version of the current logo. (I believe this was more of a quick sketch of how the logo could be improved than a fully-formed "proposal")

Discuss and vote on the logo proposals. If you like the direction one of the designs is heading but aren't ready to adopt it altogether, this is also a good place for feedback.

==== Adopt {{shaners}}'s proposal ====
* +1 It looks great and preserves the best parts of the current one - it's still immediately recognizable as the same event. I could take or leave the hash before "IndieWebCamp" :) [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 14:13, 3 February 2016 (PST)
* Crystal Beasley on Twitter: "As the person who designed the first one, I approve! ;)" &mdash; https://twitter.com/crystaldbeasley/status/694924238977798145"
* +1 Really appreciate seeing the design process behind it. <span class="h-card">[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 11:21, 4 February 2016 (PST)
* +0 The thing that is a little jarring is squaring off the C - before the I and W had extra curly bits, but the C worked, now the C is being cut with a rectangle. Could you use a corner radius on the cut-out to make it rounder? Or use a superellipse instead of a rectangle? I see that the circle on circle didn't quite work, but the rectangle is very harsh. [[User:Kevinmarks.com|Kevinmarks.com]] 15:54, 4 February 2016 (PST)
* +0 I generally like the new style but I prefer the latest iteration with the rounded C versions (lower left of [https://slack-files.com/T03QR2B2T-F0LFT9G3T-fe40b97474] if the center of the inner cut-out circle is aligned with the outer circle to make them concentric; alternatively the upper left one). This was also what our graphic designer was thinking. {{jkphl}} 22:10, 10 February 2016 (CET)
** {{t}} I had a similar reaction, lower left looked best of those four (and better than embedded square cut-out version).
* FYI: there's a new round of iterations that I need to post up here (and on my site). I'll update this soon. (2016-02-11 â€”{{veganstraightedge}})

== Logo change at IndieWeb Summit 2016 ==
* +1 {{t}}  I proposed to aaronpk that perhaps any logo change could be done / announced at/for the IndieWeb Summit in June [[2016]], and that until then, we stick with existing logo for everything, e.g. handing out existing stickers etc.
* +1 {{kevinmarks}}
* +1 {{jgarber}}
* +1 {{veganstraightedge}} This will give me enough time to work through a whole style guide.
* +1 {{kylewm}} Excited about the theatrics of "unveiling" the new logo at the end of the intro video.
* +1 {{aaronpk}} gives us plenty of time to get new stickers and things with the new logo
* ...
