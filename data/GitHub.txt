__TOC__

== Self-hosted alternatives ==
{{main|git#Software}}
There are various self-hosted alternatives to github:
* [[gitlab]]
* [[gitosis]]
* [[gitorious]]

== Criticism ==
=== DMCA harassment ===
You can lose your data due to unjustified DMCA takedowns:
* [https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014-07-02-Qualcomm.md Takedown] and [http://ausdroid.net/2014/07/05/qualcomm-retracts-dmca-takedown-request-apologises-involved/ Apology]
* Github has since improved this process by defining how they are handled better, specifically allowing for the owner to make needed corrections or to move hosts. https://github.com/blog/1908-a-better-dmca-process
=== DDoS collateral damage ===
Github is sometimes the target of DDoS attacks, apparently targeted at specific projects. While GitHub seems to be handling the attacks in such a way as to keep access working, this is a vulnerability of any centralized service, that it attracts attacks unrelated to your use of it, that jeopardize your use of it (collateral damage).

* 2015-03-26 DDoS attack [https://github.com/blog/1981-large-scale-ddos-attack-on-github-com] via unsuspecting browsers executing scripts from ([[MitM]]) faked [[Baidu]] requests[http://insight-labs.org/?p=1682].
