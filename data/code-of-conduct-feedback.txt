* I propose that we add "political orientation" or something to that effect to the list of things. -- {{veganstraightedge}} 2013-02-15 10:14 PST
** This sounds reasonable. Is there a pre-existing phrase used by one of the [[code-of-conduct-examples]] that conceptually covers this? {{tantek}} 12:06, 15 February 2013 (PST)
*** None that I know of. (And I can't believe that this is two years old now?) {{veganstraightedge}} 2015-03-15 15:20 PST
**** Yup, was waiting for an answer to hopefully re-use a pre-existing phrase rather than making up our own. Since in 2+ years no one has found a pre-existing example, is this solving a non-problem? Anticipated problem? Or Under/unreported? {{tantek}} 15:45, 15 March 2015 (PDT)
*** [[Django]] code of conduct uses "political belief" [https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/] <blockquote>Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</blockquote> — <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/assets/img/profile.jpg}} [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> ([[User talk:Gregorlove.com|talk]]) 18:29, 16 June 2015 (PDT)
** Possibly relevant: the StrangeLoop conference uninvited Curtis Yarvin ("Mencius Moldbug") because of (odious) political writings [https://s3.amazonaws.com/sl-notes/yarvin.txt]. The organizer's rationale for excluding him was that it would be an unwelcome distraction from the technical content of the conference. It's worth considering what we would do... {{kylewm}} 18:05, 16 June 2015 (PDT)

* How do people feel about adding age to the list of things we respect people regardless of? --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 23:21, 14 February 2013 (PST)
** Done. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 12:06, 15 February 2013 (PST)
