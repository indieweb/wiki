= Set-based concurrent engineering (SBCE) =

"One of the ideas in lean product development is the notion of set-based concurrent engineering: considering a solution as the intersection of a number of feasible parts, rather than iterating on a bunch of individual "point-based" solutions. This lets several groups work at the same time, as they converge on a solution." -[http://xp123.com/articles/set-based-concurrent-engineering/]

"Set-based concurrent engineering (SBCE) begins by broadly considering sets of possible solutions (in parallel and relatively independently) and gradually narrowing the set of possibilities to converge on a final solution. Gradually eliminating weaker solutions increases the likelihood of finding the best or better solutions. In this way, Toyota can move more quickly toward convergence and production than their traditional, “point-based” counterparts." - [http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toyotas-principles-of-setbased-concurrent-engineering/]

The indieweb (parallel) diversity of approaches/implementations seems very similar to this.
