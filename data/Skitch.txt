'''<dfn>Skitch</dfn>''' is an application for OSX which can take screenshots, add annotations, and share the images to multiple destinations such as Evernote, FTP, or a [[WebDAV]] endpoint.

== Skitch 1.0 ==
After being acquired by Evernote, Skitch 2.0 removed the ability to share to WebDAV endpoints.[http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2012/11/21/skitch-and-evernote-a-letter-from-keith-lang/]

You can still download the last version of Skitch 1.0 from Evernote here: http://get.skitch.com/Skitch-1.0.12.zip

== Use with IndieWeb Sites ==
Because Skitch supports sending files to a WebDAV endpoint, it is possible to use Skitch to post screenshots to one's own website, assuming the website supports WebDAV.

[[p3k]] supports posting images via WebDAV into an "uploads" folder [http://caseorganic.com/articles/2014/02/10/1/my-domain-now-supports-skitch-uploads since 2014-02-10]
