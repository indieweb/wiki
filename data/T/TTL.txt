'''<dfn>TTL</dfn>''' is Time-To-Live, a measure in seconds of how long a DNS record (such as a name-to-address mapping) is valid.

== DNS Examples ==
* Google's public DNS at 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 respects TTL settings as low as 0, effectively supporting a setting for 'do-not-cache'.
* OpenDNS's public DNS at 208.67.222.222/208.67.222.220 has a minimum TTL setting of about 10 seconds.

== Observing the Effect of DNS TTL ==
On a terminal with the '''dig''' and '''watch''' programs, run a per-second lookup of the domain under test:

 <kbd>watch -n 1 "dig +short test1.indieweb.org @208.67.222.222"<kbd>

As you then update DNS IP settings, the results displayed should change to the new IP setting within the seconds specified in the TTL.
