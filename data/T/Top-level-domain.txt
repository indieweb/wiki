{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>top-level domain</dfn>''' ('''TLD''') is the last part of a domain name, such as <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, <code>.org</code>.

== TLDs for web development ==

Many developers use a TLD for local domains for development. <code>.dev</code> is often used for this, but was registered in 2015 by Google [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/13/google_developer_gtld_domain_icann/]. In 2017, Google enabled HSTS for all <code>.dev</code> domains [https://ma.ttias.be/chrome-force-dev-domains-https-via-preloaded-hsts/] meaning it will not allow to work over [[HTTP]] any more.

[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606 RFC 2606] explicitly reserves <code>.test</code>, <code>.example</code>, and <code>.invalid</code> [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2017-09-17/1505668270070000]. There is [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-let-localhost-be-localhost-06 a draft specification for <code>.localhost</code>].

== Database of available TLDs ==

The IANA manages the authoritative list of TLDs on their website: [https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db the Root Zone Database]. Every domain has its own Delegation Record that is linked to and can be checked. If you would like to know [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-10-27/1509145554673000 who owns <code>.cat</code>] you can check [https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/cat.html its Delegation Record].
