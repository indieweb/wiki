** "This is what you get now when you sign up to Twitter Blue. Obviously no one can actually see your checkmark yet. Zero verification whatsoever of your identity. None. It’s just a “pro” badge designed to look like Twitter has checked who you are. It’s basically a dangerous lie." [http://www.plasticbag.org/ @tomcoates] November 5, 2022
