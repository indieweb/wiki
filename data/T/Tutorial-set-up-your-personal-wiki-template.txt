<span class="p-summary">This tutorial will help you set up a small template that you can use when updating the IndieWeb wiki to easily add your name, photo, and a link to your user page. These templates are commonly used when adding yourself to IndieWeb Example sections or taking notes in [[etherpad]]s.</span>

== Prerequisites ==

We recommend that you do the first three steps of [[wikifying#How_to_Join_the_IndieWeb_Wiki|wikifying]] if you haven't already.

== How To ==
=== Create the template ===
# On [[Special:Mypage|your wiki user page]], temporarily add: <code><nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki></code>
#* Replace "yourname" with your chosen [[chat-name]] or other short form of your name
#* This is not your domain. You donâ€™t use your domain in chat so please no "www." or ".com" etc. in your template either.
#* This should result in a red link, which indicates the template page has not been created yet. If the link is not red, that means someone already has chosen that template name and you should choose another.
# Click the red link and you'll be prompted to create the template page
# Copy, paste, and edit with your information:<pre><nowiki><span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|1=http://example.com/your-profile-image.jpg}} [[User:Example.com|Your Display Name]]</span></nowiki></pre>
#* In the <code>sparkline</code> section, replace with the URL to your profile photo. (note that you do '''not''' edit the word <code>sparkline</code>)
#* After the sparkline, replace the wiki link to [[Special:Mypage|your user page]] and enter your name as you'd like it displayed
#* Note your wiki user page is based on the domain you signed in with and the first letter is capitalized, so it will be <code><nowiki>[[User:Example.com]]</nowiki></code> instead of <code><nowiki>[[User:example.com]]</nowiki></code>
# After saving the template, preview it on [[Special:Mypage|your wiki user page]]. Once it is working correctly, you can remove it from your user page
# You can now use your template on any wiki pages: <code><nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki></code>, replacing with your chosen name.

=== Update the template ===

If you need to update the name, photo, or link, you can find the template at:

<pre>https://indieweb.org/Template:yourname</pre>

Replace "yourname" with the name you chose when you created the template

=== Add documentation to the template ===

''This section is optional''.

When viewing the personal template page directly, it will show your name, photo, and link exactly as it will appear when you include it on other pages. If you would like to provide some additional information on the page, you can use a combination of MediaWiki's <code>includeonly</code> and <code>noinclude</code> tags.

First edit your template and wrap the contents in <code>includeonly</code>:
<pre><nowiki><includeonly><span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|1=http://example.com/your-profile-image.jpg}} [[User:Example.com|Your Display Name]]</span></includeonly></nowiki></pre>

This will make your personal template only appear when its included in wiki pages when you use <code><nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki></code>

Then edit your template and add a <code>noinclude</code> section that describes the what the template is for:

<pre><noinclude>This template can be used to include a sparkline for {{yourname}} anywhere within the wiki. Just copy/paste: <nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki> into the page where it should appear.

For more details see also [[wikify#Wikify_yourself|Wikify yourself]].</noinclude></pre>

For examples of how this will look, see [[:Template:t]] or [[:Template:gRegor]]

=== Include the template in your wiki signature ===
''This section is optional''.

MediaWiki allows you to add your signature when editing, which can be useful in brainstorming sections. 

To use your personal template in signatures, open the [[Special:Preferences]] page and scroll to the "Signature" section. In the "New Signature" field, add <code><nowiki>{{subst:yourname}}</nowiki></code>. Replace "yourname" with your chosen name. Check the box for "Treat signature as wikitext (without an automatic link)" and click "Save."

You will now be able to sign your comments on the wiki with your template, using three tildes: <nowiki>~~~</nowiki>

To sign with your template + current datetime, use four tildes: <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>

== Examples ==
Here are a few examples of how the templates will appear:

* <code><nowiki>{{chrisaldrich}}</nowiki></code> entered into a wiki page will display: {{chrisaldrich}}
* <code><nowiki>{{aaronpk}}</nowiki></code> entered into a wiki page will display: {{aaronpk}}
