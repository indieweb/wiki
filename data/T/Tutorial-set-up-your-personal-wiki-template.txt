<span class="p-summary">This tutorial will help you set up a small template that you can use when updating the IndieWeb wiki to easily add your name, photo, and a link to your user page. These templates are commonly used when adding yourself to IndieWeb Example sections or taking notes in [[etherpad]]s.</span>

== Prerequisites ==

We recommend that you do the first three steps of [[wikifying#How_to_Join_the_IndieWeb_Wiki|wikifying]] if you haven't already.

== How To ==
=== Create the template ===
# On [[Special:Mypage|your wiki user page]], temporarily add: <code><nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki></code>
#* Replace "yourname" with your chosen [[chat-name]] or other short form of your name
#* This is not your domain. You donâ€™t use your domain in chat so please no "www." or ".com" etc. in your template either.
#* This should result in a red link, which indicates the template page has not been created yet. If the link is not red, that means someone already has chosen that template name and you should choose another.
# Click the red link and you'll be prompted to create the template page
# Copy, paste, and edit with your information:<pre><nowiki><span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|1=http://example.com/your-profile-image.jpg}} [[User:Example.com|Your Display Name]]</span></nowiki></pre>
#* In the <code>sparkline</code> section, replace with the URL to your profile photo. (note that you do '''not''' edit the word <code>sparkline</code>)
#* After the sparkline, replace the wiki link to [[Special:Mypage|your user page]] and enter your name as you'd like it displayed
#* Note your wiki user page is based on the domain you signed in with and the first letter is capitalized, so it will be <code><nowiki>[[User:Example.com]]</nowiki></code> instead of <code><nowiki>[[User:example.com]]</nowiki></code>
# After saving the template, preview it on [[Special:Mypage|your wiki user page]]. Once it is working correctly, you can remove it from your user page
# You can now use your template on any wiki pages: <code><nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki></code>, replacing with your chosen name.

=== Update the template ===

If you need to update the name, photo, or link, you can find the template at:

<pre>https://indieweb.org/Template:yourname</pre>

Replace "yourname" with the name you chose when you created the template

== Examples ==
Here are a few examples of how the templates will appear:

* <code><nowiki>{{chrisaldrich}}</nowiki></code> entered into a wiki page will display: {{chrisaldrich}}
* <code><nowiki>{{aaronpk}}</nowiki></code> entered into a wiki page will display: {{aaronpk}}
* [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=Template%3Asparkline&namespace=10 Browse other community members' templates]
