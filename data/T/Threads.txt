<blockquote>Despite the fact that Threads users can’t follow or see mentions from people on other instances, Threads has already opted to block a slew of instances where gay & leather people congregate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Threads, the topic of “Threads Moderation Failures” is trending. Some users complain their accounts are being deleted or restricted for linking to articles with controversial topics. Instagram and Threads boss Adam Mosseri is directly replying to some complaints and said he’s “looking into it.” And I’m one of many people who’s had their account deleted for allegedly being a child — which I am not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I don’t think it’s nice to federate with a company that has been cited in multiple independent reports of massacres/genocides,” FediGarden’s operator tells us, “That’s why I’m adding the rule about not federating with such companies. If servers want to do that it’s their decision, but it doesn’t seem a nice thing to do. I can’t honestly recommend such servers.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Aside from the fact that Threads is a Meta product, it also appears to have policy issues that stand in stark contrast with the rest of the network: a recent report by GLAAD reveals that homophobia and transphobia have largely flourished within networks stewarded by Meta, and transphobic content still seems to flow freely from accounts like Libs of Tiktok on the platform. Similarly, Facebook’s own moderation practices have exacerbated cultural tensions to the point of promoting violence and genocide.</blockquote>
