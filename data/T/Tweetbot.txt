'''<dfn>[https://twitter.com/tweetbot Tweetbot]</dfn>''' is a popular [[Twitter]] client which suffered from critically reduced functionality on 2018-08-16 due to Twitter disabling parts of their public [[API]].

== User Feedback ==

{{cleverdevil}} still uses Tweetbot on both iOS and macOS even after Twitter's API changes, and doesn't find the experience to be that reduced. The biggest loss is push notifications for mentions and DMs.
