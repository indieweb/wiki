'''<dfn>[https://www.thisismyjam.com/ This Is My Jam]</dfn>''' (abbreviation <dfn><abbr>TIMJ</abbr></dfn>) was a [[silo]] for sharing music you were enjoying, commonly called "[[jams]]". It was operational between 2011 and 2015.

A jam lasted for up to a week, emphasising the ephemeral nature of jams as favourite songs at that particular point in time. Users could follow each other, like and comment on each other’s jams. Jams were picked from [[YouTube]], [[SoundCloud]], [[The Hype Machine]], [[Vimeo]], and other sources on the open Internet, as well as uploaded songs that users owned the rights to.

This Is My Jam had an [[API]], however no one used it to POSSE to. You could manually POSSE however, and some folks who published [[jam]] posts also POSSEd them to TIMJ.

== Shutdown ==

This Is My Jam went into a read-only mode on 2015-09-26. The specific reasons were outlined in <cite>[http://thisismyjam.tumblr.com/post/126260430022/jam-preserves Jam Preserves]</cite>, a blog post written by the founders Matt Ogle and Hannah Donovan:

<blockquote>After nearly a year assessing many options, we’ve decided to stop operating This Is My Jam in its current form.</blockquote>

Read-only: <blockquote>This Is My Jam will become a read-only time capsule in September. This means you won’t be able to post anymore, but you’ll be able to browse a new archive version of the site.</blockquote>

Export: <blockquote>Your profile data (jams, loves, etc) will also be exportable in a few formats, including text lists; the [http://www.thisismyjam.com/developers read-only API] will stay online for developers who want to play; </blockquote>

Open source: <blockquote>we’ll also be open sourcing as much code as we can [https://github.com/thisismyjam on Github].</blockquote>

Problems with proprietary [[snowflake]] [[API]]s: <blockquote>keeping the jams flowing doesn’t just involve our own code; we interoperate with YouTube, SoundCloud, Twitter, Facebook, The Hype Machine, The Echo Nest, Amazon, and more. Over the last year, changes to those services have meant instead of working on Jam features, 100% of our time’s been spent updating years-old code libraries and hacking around deprecations just to keep the lights on. The trend is accelerating with more breaking/shutting off each month, soon exceeding our capacity to fix it. </blockquote>

Licensing and geo barriers increased: <blockquote>more sophisticated licensing and geographic controls meant “sorry, this cannot be played here” messages became the norm rather than the exception.</blockquote>

== Archival ==

[https://thisismyjam.com thisismyjam.com] now redirects to an archived copy of the website on the [[Wayback Machine]].

The team published a data dump on the [[Internet Archive]] that contains [https://archive.org/details/thisismyjam-datadump anonymized jam, like, and follower data].
