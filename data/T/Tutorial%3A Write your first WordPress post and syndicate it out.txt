When you are done, set the post kind to the kind of post it is in the sidebar.

|-
|5.
| Visit Twitter, Facebook or whatever other silos you syndicated your post post to. While they may not get the update instantaneously, they usually have it rather quickly.
|-
|6.
|Watch comments come in. Your friends might be commenting on Instagram or Twitter, but your WordPress site will end up with copies of their comments.
|

Congratulations!
