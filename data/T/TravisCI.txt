'''<dfn>[https://travis-ci.com/ TravisCI]</dfn>''' is a SaaS company that offers Continuous Integration services that started charging open source projects as of 2020, and in 2021 was compromised for credentials to access thousands of projects and organizations.

=== Compromised security ===

** "Between the 3 Sept and 10 Sept, secure env vars of *all* public @travisci repositories were injected into PR builds. Signing keys, access creds, API tokens. <br><br>Anyone could exfiltrate these and gain lateral movement into 1000s of orgs. #security 1/4<br><br>https://travis-ci.community/t/security-bulletin/12081" [https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi @peter_szilagyi] September 14, 2021

=== Pricing Changes ===
TravisCI had generous free offerings for open-source projects in the past, but by 2021 these have been severely limited and generally are not recommended anymore.
