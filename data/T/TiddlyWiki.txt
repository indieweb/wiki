'''<dfn>[https://tiddlywiki.com/ TiddlyWiki]</dfn>''' is a responsive website platform built as a single file in [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]]. While intended as a non-linear notebook / [[commonplace book]] / [[wiki]] all of its versions and flavors are built as a website that can be served from a variety of locations.
 
There are two types of TiddlyWiki: "Classic" and TW5 or TiddlyWiki version 5.

<blockquote>Use it to keep your to-do list, to plan an essay or novel, or to organise your wedding. Record every thought that crosses your brain, or build a flexible and responsive website.

Unlike conventional online services, TiddlyWiki lets you choose where to keep your data, guaranteeing that in the decades to come you will still be able to use the notes you take today. &mdash;TiddlyWiki website

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [https://jermolene.com/ Jeremy Ruston] uses TiddlyWiki for his personal website. ([[self-dogfooding]])
** The [https://tiddlywiki.com/ TiddlyWiki] website is built on TiddlyWiki 5

* [https://sphygm.us/ sphygm.us] has a personal website at https://sphygm.us/ with incoming [[Webmention]] support using [[Webmention.io]]

* [https://tacticaltypos.net/ Brandon Hall] uses a custom workflow (detailed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRZeH680XWA here on YouTube]) to turn his local TiddlyWiki install into a [[static site]] website. 
** Note: He uses a clever template for providing an RSS feed, but this could also be used to present an h-feed as well.

* {{chrisaldrich}} started with a private locally hosted TiddlyWiki to explore how to host it on a publicly available server as an open version of a [[commonplace book]]. Starting on 2020-04-02 he has a subdomain of his primary site at http://tw.boffosocko.com that uses [[GitHub Pages]] for hosting. He's detailed the process at [https://boffosocko.com/2020/04/04/self-hosting-tiddlywiki-with-github-pages/ Self-hosting TiddlyWiki with GitHub Pages].
** {{chrisaldrich}} briefly documented how he set up webmention using [[webmention.io]] at http://tw.boffosocko.com/#Webmentions%20into%20header%20of%20TW5. With a traditional set up one should be able to drag the following tiddler into their public-facing installation and make the appropriate changes to the URLs for the Webmention and Pingbacks: http://tw.boffosocko.com/#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2Findieweb%2Fcore%2FrawMarkup
** Sending webmentions for a free-standing <code>index.html</code> version of TiddlyWiki may be more difficult unless done natively as many services like [[webmention.io]] will have issues using TiddlyWiki's [[fragment]] URL structure to send them because of the [[js;dr]] problem.
*** Ideas for fixing this are welcome...

* [https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/research-affiliates/8613-john-lacava/ John LaCava] maintains a TwiddlyWiki as a lab notebook: https://macromolecule.rockefeller.edu/

* [https://ooktech.com/jed/externalbrain/#Dashboard Jed Carty] has an indie TiddlyWiki site at with rel-me and an h-card at https://ooktech.com/jed/externalbrain/#Me

== Examples in the wild ==
* [https://rudimentarylathe.org/ Jack Baty] has several sites including a TiddlyWiki which he uses as "A sort of Rudimentary Lathe"

* [https://wiki.joshsullivan.io Josh Sullivan] has a [[TiddlyWiki]] hosted via [[GitHub Pages]] at https://github.com/joshcsullivan/joshcsullivan.github.io. He specifically calls it an online [[commonplace book]]

* [http://wiki.lu4.org/ Luana Ol√≠veira] has a [[TiddlyWiki]] hosted via [[GitHub Pages]] at https://github.com/luanaoliv/luanaoliv.github.io. They specifically calls it an online [[commonplace book]].

== Silo examples ==
* There are hosted versions of classic TiddlyWiki (and other flavors) available at [http://tiddlyspot.com TiddlySpot]. One can also use this silo to host TiddlyWiki version 5 as well using instructions at http://tiddlywiki5.tiddlyspot.com/
* [https://xememex.com/ XEMEMEX] hosts a variety of TiddlyWikis


== Plugins ==
The service has a variety of [https://tiddlywiki.com/#Plugins plugins] including:
* [http://tiddlymap.org/ TiddlyMap] - a mind-map plugin that shows visualizations for Tiddlers.


== Brainstorming ==
Because the platform is fairly modular and created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript it shouldn't be too difficult to add the following IndieWeb friendly pieces:
* [[Microformats]] v2 classes including an [[h-card]]
** {{chrisaldrich}} article on [https://boffosocko.com/2020/04/12/an-h-card-for-my-tiddlywiki/ a hack for doing an h-card in TiddlyWiki]
* Incoming Webmention support can be easily added with [[Webmention.io]], but could potentially be implemented via a JavaScript plugin. There are existing JavaScript set ups for potentially showing webmentions on particular Tiddlers.
* IndieAuth ??
* Micropub ??


== Criticisms ==
* Unsuitable for [[text-first design|Text only]] devices.
* Large overhead. (compared to what though?)
* Depending on the set up, the implementation of some websites may suffer from [[js;dr]] problems.
