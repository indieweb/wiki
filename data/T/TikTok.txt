=== Unequal & exploitative revenue share ===
TikTok uses a region-locked "creator fund", a set pool of money that is distributed amongst popular accounts and viral videos. This creates a system where creators end up being paid less individually the more people use (and succeed) on the platform, and massively reduces the share of revenue reaching creators compared to other platforms, like Youtube.
