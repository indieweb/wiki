* Criticism: Tailwind (and other inline-style directives CSS frameworks, utility classes etc.) don’t actually solve the problem of avoiding naming things, because you actually do need to name things to communicate in teams. e.g. https://twitter.com/StuRobson/status/1235472931528028161 (and if you're not on a team, learn CSS and use style attributes which will last longer)
