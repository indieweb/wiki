{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Tailwind</dfn>''' is one of several CSS frameworks, which enables the design of responsive websites. It is of no special relevance to IndieWeb other than that it allows individuals to design sites associated with their domain.

Some people, possibly unaware of their privilege, are of the opinion that it should be avoided "because it’s a naive reinvention of the style attribute which you can directly use instead". Others, less well endowed, have found it useful in designing their sites, while recognising that it may not suit everybody.

* Criticism: Tailwind (and other inline-style directives CSS frameworks, utility classes etc.) don’t actually solve the problem of avoiding naming things, because you actually do need to name things to communicate in teams. e.g. https://twitter.com/StuRobson/status/1235472931528028161 (and if you're not on a team, learn CSS and use style attributes which will last longer)
