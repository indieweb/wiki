{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Tailwind</dfn>''' is a relatively new CSS framework, created to enable responsive website design, which appears to replicate similar functionality as the standard HTML style attribute, though using abbreviated cryptic class names, despite which, some in the IndieWeb community have found useful in designing their sites.

== Examples ==
* [https://refactoringui.com Refactoring UI] - made by the same people who ''made'' Tailwind, good example of eating their own cooking
* [https://send.firefox.com Firefox Send]

== Advantages ==
Tailwind can make use of [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--* CSS variables], while the HTML style attribute cannot. This is done by specifying said variables in one's overriding CSS attributes for Tailwind. After generation, depending on how one configures [https://postcss.org/ PostCSS], said variable references remain for conventional CSS to make use of.

== Criticisms ==
=== Takes more time ===
Like many CSS frameworks, it requires learning multiple things, both CSS and the framework itself, thus takes more time to learn, which tends to require more privilege.

=== Ephemeral utility ===
Like most web frameworks, Tailwind is likely to be useful for only a brief period of time (maybe a year or two) before it is replaced or obsoleted by some other new framework, and thus is of ephemeral utility as compared to directly learning and using web standards, in this case, CSS properties and values.

Consequences:
* Loss of community. As a framework dies, so dwindles and disappears any community associated with it, thus requiring anyone using it to rely completely on self-maintenance.
* Need to keep learning new frameworks. The ephemeral nature of web frameworks like Tailwind mean that if you don't do self-maintenance, you instead of have to continuously (every year or two) learn new frameworks to replace the old ones. This is another example of costing more time, though over the long run, and thus also tends to require more privilege.

=== Reinvents style attribute ===
Tailwind’s cryptic short class names appear to be a naive and less human-readable reinvention of the standard HTML style attribute and CSS properties & values which you can directly use instead, and have been supported for over 20 years.

Exception: Tailwind may be able to use CSS "variables" (see '''Advantages''' section) which the style attribute cannot. This may or may not outweigh the other criticisms, up to the developer to evaluate if this trade-off is worth it.

=== Illusion of avoiding naming ===
Tailwind (and other inline-style directives CSS frameworks, utility classes etc.) don’t actually solve the problem of avoiding naming things (as they claim to), because you actually do need to name things to communicate in teams. e.g.
