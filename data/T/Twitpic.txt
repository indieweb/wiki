== Shut down ==
* 2014-09-25 '''TwitPic''' announced it would be shut down, but on 2014-09-18 '''TwitPic''' stated it was acquired and would not be shut down. 
**"We're happy to announce we've been acquired and Twitpic will live on! We will post more details as we can disclose them"[https://twitter.com/TwitPic/status/512705809696837632]
**Original reason for the shutdown announcement: <blockquote>A few weeks ago Twitter contacted our legal demanding that we abandon our trademark application or risk losing access to their API. [..] Unfortunately we do not have the resources to fend off a large company like Twitter to maintain our mark which we believe whole heartedly is rightfully ours. Therefore, we have decided to shut down Twitpic.</blockquote>
** Data export: <blockquote>You will be able to export all your photos and videos. We’ll let everyone know when this feature is live in the next few days.</blockquote>
** 2014-10-25 [http://blog.twitpic.com/2014/10/twitpics-future/ Twitpic’s Future] <blockquote>[…] we have reached an agreement with Twitter to give them the Twitpic domain and photo archive, thus keeping the photos and links alive <strong>for the time being</strong>. </blockquote> <strong>Emphasis added</strong>, thus implying domain and permalinks still at risk.
* 2017-12-30 Twitpic.com now redirects to Twitter.com
* 2018-03-05 Twitpic.com URLS for photos apparently still resolve directly to the photo though the prior UI for the service is gone.
