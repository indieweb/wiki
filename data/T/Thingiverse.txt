'''<dfn>[http://thingiverse.com/ Thingiverse]</dfn>''' is a popular [[silo]] for hosting 3D printable models.

== Features ==
__TOC__

It allows you to publish online your 3D models ready for 3D printing, a bit like a [http://github.com/ Github] of 3D models. You can manage collections of objects you like, and post photos of the models you printed, to show actual results to user, and compare your print quality.

==Exporting your data==
[https://github.com/carlosgs/export-things Some scripts] are available to handle it (with scraping), but nothing built-in to export your data. Should be better and more resilient to use the API for this.

==POSSE==
Thingiverse has a [http://www.thingiverse.com/developers fully featured API] which can be used to do almost everything you can do with the website (like / post things / edit things / …).

Then, it should not be really difficult to POSSE with Thingiverse. Phyks is interested in it for his hacklab and will update this if he manages to have anything functionnal.
