'''<dfn>The Cask of Amontillado</dfn>''' is an 1846 short story written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in which a character is chained to a wall and walled up, analogous to many [[silo]] practices.

In the story, one of the characters is, while inebriated, chained to a wall and bricked up alive. 

The story can be used as an analogy to many [[silos]], which are often open and welcoming at various points in their existence. But once they generate a user base, they often start to wall up their users inside.

Examples include:
* [[Twitter]] and its decision to discourage the third-party applications that initially brought many users into the platform
* [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] discontinuing [[XMPP]] support, etc.
