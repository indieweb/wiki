{{stub}}

'''<dfn>TSS</dfn>''' is Twitter Style Sheets or Text Style Sheets, a compressed form of CSS applicable to short bits of text, suitable for storing in very small fields like 512 bytes. 

Open source [[CASSIS]] implementation: http://xent.com/tss.js 

Live UI: http://xent.com/rtf (requires JS for the "live" part :)
* try picking from the presets to see sample "TSS" code, as well as HTML as a result of applying it to sample text. (no need to sign-in to Twitter)
