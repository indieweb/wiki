{{stub}}

'''<dfn>TSS</dfn>''' is Twitter Style Sheets or Text Style Sheets, a compressed form of CSS applicable to short bits of text, suitable for storing in very small fields like 512 bytes. 

Open source [[CASSIS]] implementation: http://xent.com/tss.js 

== Design ==
Summary from tss.js:
<blockquote><pre>
// TSS decoder / HTML encoder
// Tantek Çelik http://tantek.com/ 2010-150
// decodes:
// {(p:v;)+}?       // whole tweet rule
// (*{(p:v;)+})?    // generic rule for all runs
// (n,n{(p:v;)+})*  // relative offset, length run specific rule
</pre></blockquote>

== Demo ==
Live UI with TSS examples: http://xent.com/rtf (requires JS for the "live" part :)
* try picking from the presets to see sample "TSS" code, as well as HTML as a result of applying it to sample text. (no need to sign-in to Twitter)
