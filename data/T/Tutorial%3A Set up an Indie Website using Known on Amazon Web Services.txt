Some of this tutorial might look a little geeky, but we are documenting every step and you should be able to follow through without problems even if you are not a geek.

* A Macintosh, Linux or Windows computer with a web browser.
* About an hour of time.
* A small budget:
** hosting by Amazon is likely free for one year, less than $10 per month thereafter
** domain name varies, often $8.00 to $17.00 per year.
|
* An Indie Website you control at the domain name of your choosing.
* Secured by HTTPS.
* Running on the Amazon cloud.
* That syndicates all of your posts to Facebook and Twitter, and pulls comments people make there back on your site.
