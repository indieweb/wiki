For this tutorial, we assume that you successfully worked through the [[Tutorial: Install Known]], you now have Known running on an Amazon Web Services EC2 virtual server, with your chosen hostname set up to point to your server, and you are logged into your site.

Now we will configure Known, and related services.

Here are the steps:

{|class="steps"
| 1.
| Go to the site configuration page by selecting "Site Configuration" from the drop-down menu in the top-right corner.
