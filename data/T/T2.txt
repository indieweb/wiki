* ^ <blockquote><p>Hi folks, a year ago I started a Twitter alternative (initially called T2, later called Pebble). Tomorrow we will be shutting it down. We just weren't growing quickly enough to be able to raise money to build it out. It was also a super competitive space as evidenced by my posting this on Threads by Meta.</p><p>Lots of lessons learned. Will share some of them here in a bit.</p></blockquote>
