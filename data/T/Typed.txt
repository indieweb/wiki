'''<dfn>[http://typed.com Typed]</dfn>''' was a blogging [[silo]] that raised $99,882 in 2015 by 879 backers on [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/typed-a-better-blogging-platform#description indiegogo]. It was built in Brighton, UK by [https://www.realmacsoftware.com realmacsoftware], better known for their web-publishing application RapidWeaver.

The developers promised to [[selfdogfood]] and that:

"Weâ€™re in this for the long haul, and will be publishing our own blogs with Typed."

The service went into beta around May 2015, subsequently had a public launch around September 2015, was still being developed in 2016 (but still lacked some long-requested features), and was eventually shuttered during 2017.
