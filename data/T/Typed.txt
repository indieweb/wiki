'''<dfn>[http://typed.com Typed]</dfn>''' was a blogging [[silo]] that raised $99,882 in 2015 by [[crowdfunding]] from 879 backers on [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/typed-a-better-blogging-platform#description indiegogo]. It was built in Brighton, UK by [https://www.realmacsoftware.com RealMacSoftware], better known for their web-publishing application RapidWeaver.

The developers promised to [[selfdogfood]] and that:

"Weâ€™re in this for the long haul, and will be publishing our own blogs with Typed."

The service went into beta around May 2015, subsequently had a public launch around September 2015, was still being developed in 2016 (and still lacked some long-requested features), and was eventually shuttered during 2017. The swag (stickers, t-shirts, and limited edition t-shirts) for backers was never delivered. Throughout its short lifespan communication from RealMacSoftware was somewhat limited, and the six-month silence and lack of any updates before the service was shuttered did not endear RealMacSoftware to its indiegogo backers who were already considering it dead.
