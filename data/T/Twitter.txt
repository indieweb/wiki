'''<dfn>Twitter</dfn>''' (also known as <dfn>Twitter.com</dfn>) is a popular content hosting [[silo]] most well known for originally limited to 140 characters text [[notes]]. Over 11 years later, the [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/twitter-280-characters-tweets-start-when-get-latest-a8042716.html limitation was raised to 280].

== Why ==
Why use Twitter? Besides all the usual [[social media]] [[silo]] reasons like "everyone is on there", see what people come up with when they ask why am I using Twitter:
* 2010-11-29 [https://aurorameyer.com/tag/why-am-i-using-twitter/ Why am I using Twitter?]
* [https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%22why%20am%20I%20using%20twitter%22 Twitter search for "why am I using twitter"]

== How to ==
=== How to export your data ===
==== Download all your tweets ====
<span style="float:right; clear:right;max-width:40%">[http://bradcolbow.com/archive/view/the_long_slow_death_of_twitter/ <img src="http://bradcolbow.com/img/death-of-twitter-2.gif" style="max-width:100%" alt="Comic about the long slow death of Twitter"/>]</span>
# Go to: https://twitter.com/settings/account 
# near the bottom of the page there may be a "Your Twitter archive" section
# See the (Request your archive) button? Click it. 
# Wait some amount of time for a link to your archive to show up in your email associated with the account.

The Twitter archive is made of per month JSON files. It can be used as a way to [[PESOS]] a whole Twitter history, even though POSSE is the recommended way to do it. 

The most interesting things in the JSON twitter archive are:
* both long and shortened URLs
* "new" RTs are also written the classic Way, making easy to republish them in a PESOS way.
* every related information needed to rebuild a conversation

After you download your archive, you can update in using a Ruby Gem called [https://github.com/DeMarko/grailbird_updater GrailbirdUpdater].

==== Download Direct Messages ====
* You can use [http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/01/psa-back-up-your-shit/ this method] to download DMs from Twitter. It is complicated to set up and involves registering a new Twitter application. It can only archive about a year's worth of DMs.

==== Backup using t command line tool ====
See: https://github.com/sferik/t#using-t-for-backup

You can also export your lists with the "t" command line tool:
;List all your lists, in long format
:t lists -l
;List all the members of a list, in long format
:t list members -l following-`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`

=== How to unlock your account ===
If going to twitter.com or any Twitter profile page (e.g. [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @IndieWebCamp]) or any tweet permalink redirects you to https://twitter.com/account/access with a message like: '''Your account has been locked.''' then your account has been locked.

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>

If your account is locked (e.g. [[#New_accounts_locked_for_no_reason|a new account]]), try:

* file a support request, explain what you did immediately beforehand, and 
* reply to the email confirming your support request

Note your personal experience here so we can track how effective this is:
* 2016-10-27 [http://tantek.com/2016/301/t4/your-account-now-unlocked-twitter @PostTypeDisc unlocked]
* ...


DURING: steps you may want to take while waiting for your account to get unlocked:
* Remove Twitter from your [[contact]] page (to avoid people sending DMs that you cannot access)
* ...

AFTER: steps you should take after your account is unlocked:
* Re-authorize [[Bridgy]] (if you happen to use it)
** Go https://brid.gy/twitter/ and click the buttons to enable listening and publishing
* ...


Details:

<span style="float:left">[[File:2017-05-09-twitter-account-locked-nojs.png|240px]]</span> <p>You may have to enable [[JS]] on twitter.com and abs-0.twimg.com.</p>
<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
<span style="float:left">[[File:2017-05-09-twitter-options-help.png]]</span> Instead, click the "Options v" drop-down in the top right and choose "Help" which should take you to: https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171312 which has a bunch of different reasons why your account may have been locked. 
<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>

From that page, scroll down to where it says either:
* "If you need additional help unlocking your account, contact our support team [https://support.twitter.com/forms/signin here]." or
* "If you feel that your account has been limited in error, you can appeal by contacting our support team [https://support.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended here]."

One of those two "here" links should take you to a support form so you can file a support request as noted above.

== Porting to the IndieWeb ==
=== Implementations ===
[http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your tweets to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and with replies and retweets (yours and others') included as comments.

It's rough and unpolished. [[User:Snarfed.org|Ryan]] eventually plans to polish it up and advertise it more widely.

=== Challenges ===
* porting over content and maintaining URL redirects
** not currently possible to redirect Twitter permalinks to your own site AFAIK. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 14:33, 17 November 2012 (PST)
* porting over @-replies
** Twitter has *no* API for getting @-replies to a particular tweet. You can do it with lots of extra work, though. [[Bridgy]] does this; [http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed#Twitter details and example code here].
* porting over retweets
** Twitter has an [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/retweets/:id API endpoint] for getting retweets of a particular tweet.
*** The first 100 retweets of any particular tweet can be fetched via the API
* porting over favorites
** Twitter has *no* direct API for getting favorites of a particular tweet. You can get them as they happen from the streaming API, or you can screen scrape, but neither are ideal. [[Bridgy]] has example code for both.
* API limited to most recent 3,200 tweets
** People in Europe are legally entitled to their entire twitter history, but twitter make it very difficult to get at it (requiring a fax machine!). See: [http://marks.dk/how-to-get-more-than-3200-tweets-from-twitter-if-you-live-in-a-country-in-the-eu-that-is How to get more than 3200 tweets from twitter]
* equivalent user interface
** "twitter's editor is hard to beat though, like auto-expanding twitter handles and telling you how many characters you have left (with accounting for URL-shortening)"
*** Re: "how many characters you have left (with accounting for URL-shortening)" - there's [[CASSIS]] functions for that:
**** <code>[https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis.js#L1186 tw_text_proxy($t)]</code> - given plain text for a note, it returns a string with character count that Twitter would give it, e.g. after t.co-wrapping URLs. Useful for length estimations, and doing truncation/ellipsing computations.
***** e.g. <code>280-strlen(tw_text_proxy($t))</code> gives you # of characters left
**** <code>[https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis.js#L1255 note_length_check($note, $maxlen, $username)]</code> - given a string $note (e.g. the output from tw_text_proxy() above), a $maxlen (e.g. 280), and a $username (e.g. "@indiewebcamp"), it returns result codes (roughly based on / reusing from HTTP)
***** 200 - $note exactly fits $maxlen characters when retweeted (if $username was provided)
***** 206 - $note fits $maxlen and has room to spare even when retweeted (if $username provided)
***** 207 - $note fits $maxlen with room to spare, but a retweet would get truncated (if $username provided)
***** 208 - $note exactly fits $maxlen and a retweet would be over and get truncated
***** 413 - (entity too large) $note is over $maxlen

__TOC__
== POSSE to Twitter ==
While Twitter is still around and you still have friends on Twitter that you want to interact with, you should post your [[note]]s on your own site, and automatically syndicate them to Twitter ([[POSSE]] them) so your friends see and can interact with those copies. This section details how.

In short, you have to either use:
* Twitter's [[snowflake]] API
* [[Bridgy]] Publish proxy (see: https://brid.gy/about#publishing for details)
* [[silo.pub]] proxy
to POSSE posts to Twitter. There are people in the IndieWeb community doing each of these.

=== POSSE to Twitter in general ===
There are particularly good ways to POSSE [[notes]] and [[articles]] to Twitter which are documented in latter sections. Here are some general guidelines for POSSEing to Twitter.

Given Twitter's limitations:
* 280 characters of content
* links are t.co'd into 23 characters for http or https links
* local user (@-name) references only
* local tag (#hashtag) references only

When POSSEing to Twitter:
# provide a permalink (or perma-short-ID for entirely fitting notes) to your original at the end of the syndicated copy
# abbreviate notes / article names to fit
# include hashtags as part of that abbreviated content (even if they're beyond the ellipsis horizon) to increase syndication based discovery/searchability of your content
#* e.g.: as [http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2012/09/09/3/indieweb aaronparecki.com does]
# translate indiewebsite people references into their Twitter local user @-name equivalents

Once POSSE is successful:
* construct a URL (https) for the POSSE copy tweet and link to it from the original post using [[u-syndication]]

The sections below contain details on how to do some of this for [[notes]] and [[articles]] in particular.

=== POSSE Notes to Twitter ===
For notes, you can POSSE out up to 280* characters of your note to Twitter.

==== POSSE entire note to twitter ====
For notes that fit entirely within a tweet (*including [[permashortcitation]]), you ''should'' include a post [[permashortcitation]] at the end of your tweet. Examples:
* https://twitter.com/t/status/130570474261458944
has the permashortcitation of a permashortid in a classical parenthetical citation:
* <samp>(ttk.me t4Ec3)</samp>
which is easily expanded (see related: [[original-post-discovery]]) by unparenthesizing and joining the two pieces with a forward slash "/":
* <code>ttk.me/t4Ec3</code>
which resolves (redirects) to the original post:
* http://tantek.com/2011/303/t3/settled-falcon-perma-short-link-in-text-cite-design

==== Why permashortcitation ====
{{main|permashortcitation}}

You should use a permashortcitation instead of a permashort<em>link</em> at the end of tweet copies of notes that include the entire text of a [[note]] post, especially if your site lacks any additional content / UI as compared to Twitter (e.g. [[reply-context]]s, [[comments-presentation]], [[likes]], [[reposts]])

There's an unspoken convention on Twitter that a link in a tweet (especially at the ''end'' of a tweet) should provide more information. 

Having an active permashortlink at the end of your tweet when all you provide on your own site is the *exact* same content is bad UX for your friends that follow you on Twitter. 

Note the complaints ([https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/24154348602793984][https://twitter.com/sgalineau/status/24171771997462528]([http://tantek.com/2011/009/t2/ttk-me-permashortlinks-originals-twitter-copy response]), [https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/24213884298592256]([http://tantek.com/2011/009/t3/value-searching-finding-past-tweets-self-hosting response]), [https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/24224559787941888][https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/24521588359569409]) and questions[https://twitter.com/tigerchops/status/306879654227218432] over time that have been raised in response to apparent linking to "duplicate" or "the same" content.

The whole point of POSSE is that you still care about your friends on Twitter (or other silos) reading you, so you should care about their UX also. 

Only provide permashortlinks as part of your POSSE tweets when they link to an the original post <em>with more content</em> than in the POSSE tweet copy. Otherwise use permashortcitations so that your original posts are still automatically discoverable using the [[original-post-discovery]] algorithm.

==== POSSE abbr note to twitter ====
If your note (with permashortid) exceeds 280 characters, you should abbreviate your note to 117 (116) characters (e.g. using the [[CASSIS]] <code>ellipsize_to_word</code> function), and then put a post perma(short)link URL at the end. Shorten to 117 (116) characters (or shorter) because it takes 1 character for the space before the URL, and then Twitter t.co's all URLs (including yours) into 23 characters. 

When shortening to 256 (280-23-1) characters, you must count <em>other</em> http (https) URLs within that as 23 characters (excepting schemeless pathless ccTLDs). You can use the [[CASSIS]] <code>tw_text_proxy</code> function to automatically replace http (https) URLs in a string with 23 character proxy URLs. The return result can be used for counting how many characters the string will use as a "tweet". This is useful for e.g. evaluating <code>ellipsize_to_word</code> on the result, to get a length of characters that you can POSSE, and then using that to help determine how much of the original (non-proxy) string can be POSSEd.

You may want to put an ellipsis character at the end of your POSSEd note to Twitter before your perma(short)link. Be sure to leave room for the ellipsis too: instead of just 1 character for a space before your permashortlink, save 4 characters for "... ", or 2 characters for "… " (ellipsis entity character). Note Twitter now counts characters in a sensible fashion, they count codepoints in Unicode NFC: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/counting-characters. Ideally elide at a punctuation boundary (like sentence terminator or a comma - the above-mentioned CASSIS function does this too).
Examples (which link to original posts after eliding with "... ")
* https://twitter.com/t/status/134793377291046912 - elided after "(" left parenthesis
* https://twitter.com/t/status/228953522123706368 - elided after "," comma
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/365476652911837185 - elided at a word boundary
* ...

Exception, if your abbreviated tweet already has a ":" (colon) character at the end, no need for an ellipsis, simply append a space " " and your permashortlink.
Examples which truncate after a ":"
* https://twitter.com/t/status/184008333571801089 - truncated at ":" before more text
* https://twitter.com/t/status/179636269096247297 - truncated at ":" right before a URL
* ...

Continuing that ":" reasoning, you may also instead of an ellipsis character, use some text like "More: " or "More at:" but that likely also requires a different shortening approach, perhaps to a sentence boundary. If you're unable to shorten to a sentence boundary (e.g. a very long sentence) then you need to shorten at a word boundary and then use <em>both</em> an ellipsis character and more text, e.g.: "… More: {link}" to be consistent with this "More:" approach. The disadvantage of "More:" approach is that it requires more shortening to include the additional "More: " text.

==== POSSE Notes to Twitter Pseudocode ====
This is pseudocode based on [http://waterpigs.co.uk Barnaby Walters]’ [https://github.com/barnabywalters/php-helpers/blob/master/BarnabyWalters/Posse/Helpers.php php-helpers] package, specifically BarnabyWalters\Posse\Helpers class.

Assume that to start with you have some HTML markup representing the content of the note ($text), the canonical URI to link back to from the syndicated tweet ($url) and an optional in-reply-to url associated with the note ($inReplyTo).

# Convert any HTML in $text to twitter-like plaintext syntax, or strip it
# Truncate $text such that, once all URLs contained within it are replaced with URLs of the current t.co length (21 ATOW) there are enough characters left to contain the canonical URI with brackets around, or preceded by and ellipsis if any truncation has occurred
# Trim $text
# Append a space and $url, surrounded with brackets if no truncation has occurred or preceded by an ellipsis if truncation has occurred
# Create a hashtable representing the body of the POST request to send ($tweet)
# Set $tweet['status'] to $text
# Check to see if $inReplyTo is the URI of a tweet (see [https://github.com/barnabywalters/php-helpers/blob/master/BarnabyWalters/Posse/Helpers.php#L58 line 58])
#* If it is, grab the ID
#* Set $tweet['in_reply_to_status_id'] to the ID
# Send an authenticated POST request to the relevant API endpoint with the contents of $tweet as a urlenoded body

==== POSSE note with photos to Twitter ====
If your note has photos, e.g. [[auto-embed]]ded JPG/PNG etc. URLs, consider POSSEing those photos (first four if any, per Twitter photo-attachment limitations) as image uploads associated with your POSSEd text note.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-03-20/line/1426873564102]

=== POSSE Articles to Twitter ===
Similar to POSSEing a note, you can POSSE an article to Twitter, but instead of the first 280 characters of the post, you should POSSE the first 280 characters of the entry name (title) of the article, followed by optionally a ":" character (unless the entry title already ends with punctuation), then a space " ", then the perma(short)link to your original post, and optionally one or more hashtags you used in the article. Examples: 
* https://twitter.com/t/status/21599383183 (no colon between tweeted title and blog post permalink)
* https://twitter.com/t/status/24915461441 (entry title ends with punctuation, no ":" needed)
* https://twitter.com/t/status/10572648543162368 (colon between tweeted title and blog post permalink)
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/973350110334615552 (colon between tweeted title and blog post permalink)
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/987417368421842944 (entry title has a ":" in it, no ":" added. includes hashtag after the URL)
* ...

Alternatively, you can write a short note about the article and POSSE that instead. Examples:

* [https://aaronparecki.com/2018/04/17/5/webauthn note on aaronparecki.com] and [https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/986254367283007488 twitter copy]
* [https://aaronparecki.com/2018/01/24/21/indieweb note on aaronparecki.com] and [https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/956232846359736320 twitter copy]

* [[User:T37.net]] (e.g. (citation of article post, POSSE tweet))
* ... add yourself (alphabetically) if you have this working

=== POSSE Replies to Tweets ===
Similar to POSSEing a note to Twitter, when POSSEing a reply to a tweet, you also set the <code>in_reply_to_status_id</code> field in the API call to the URL of the tweet that your note is in reply to, to enable the threading UI and presentation on Twitter.com.

You can use this regular expression to extract tweet IDs from tweet URLs:

<code>/https?:\/\/twitter.com\/[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,20}\/status\/([0-9]*)/</code>

Examples, i.e. IndieWebCamp community members who are doing this:

* [[User:Tommorris.org]] with [[Ferocity]] (e.g. [http://tommorris.org/posts/8350 reply post], [https://twitter.com/tommorris/status/343394303252516864 tweet])
* [[User:Snarfed.org]] with [[WordPress]] via [[Bridgy]] ([https://snarfed.org/responses#replies snarfed.org/responses#replies])

=== POSSE Replies to Twitter ===
==== original has POSSE tweet ====
If the original indieweb post that you're replying to has a POSSE tweet copy:

When posting a comment which is a reply to another indieweb post, the POSSE tweet of your comment should attempt to set the <code>in_reply_to_status_id</code> to the POSSE tweet of the indieweb post you're replying to.

This is similar to how you '''POSSE Replies to Tweets''' but with one extra step to discover the POSSE tweet of the original post:
* You can discover the POSSE tweet of an indieweb post by look for a [[u-syndication]] hyperlink from the indieweb post to a tweet.
* For more details, see: '''[[reply#POSSE_a_reply|How to POSSE a reply]]'''

See also: [[in-reply-to]], [[comments]].

==== original lacks POSSE tweet ====
If the indieweb post (or other URL) has no equivalent POSSE tweet and is not a tweet URL itself, then there are two possibilities, depending on whether your reply is "self-contained" enough to be meaningful without the context of what you're replying to.

'''Replies that do need the context of the original to make sense:'''
* Start your POSSE tweet with the '''@-name''' of the author of the indieweb post.
** E.g. use a [[nicknames-cache]] to automatically determine the @-name from the original post's domain name.
* Use common reply phrasing like "'''re: '''"
* Followed by the '''permashortlink''' of the original indieweb post
* '''linebreak''' - optional, but takes no more characters than a space, and helps separate the "re:" phrasing from your actual reply content
* your '''reply content''' as much as will fit per previous ellipsing analysis
* '''permashortlink''' to the rest of your reply, or permashortcitation

IndieWeb Examples of replies to indie web posts without POSSE tweet (with POSSE reply copy nested):
* http://tantek.com/2015/162/t2/indieweb-ui-ux-sketch-build

IndieWeb Examples of replies to silo posts/comments without POSSE tweet (with POSSE reply copies nested):
* http://tantek.com/2015/260/t3/donated-books-goodwill
** Twitter: https://twitter.com/t/status/644705364961796097
** Facebook (into the in-reply-to context) https://www.facebook.com/tantek.celik/posts/10101883746673363?comment_id=10101883803689103&reply_comment_id=10101890274751043

'''If your reply is meaningfully "self-contained" enough to be relevant to your Twitter readers:'''
* write your reply in a such that you can reference the indieweb in-reply-to URL as a reference inline
* end with your permashortlink or permashortcitation as you would for your POSSE notes.

IndieWeb Examples of this:
* http://tantek.com/2015/159/t2/of-the-indieweb-because-silos-die
** https://twitter.com/t/status/608157213488578560

Another alternative for meaningfully self-contained replies is to include the non-Twitter in-reply-to URL as the last thing before your permashortlink in the POSSE tweet copy of your reply so Twitter can potentially show context of the in-reply-to URL in the POSSE tweet copy of your reply.
* IndieWeb reply example: https://jeena.net/notes/97
** POSSE tweet copy: https://twitter.com/jeena/status/436675022443511808

Lastly, another option is to not POSSE replies to indieweb posts which themselves lack POSSE copies. IndieWeb community members have also found joy out of site-to-site replies that never hit Twitter, and thus reflect another level of independence.

=== POSSE Reposts of Tweets ===
When posting a [[repost]] of a tweet, the proper POSSE behavior should be to do a native retweet (on Twitter) of the tweet that you're reposting on your own site.

Examples of reposts of tweets:
* [[User:Snarfed.org]] with [[WordPress]] via [[Bridgy]] ([https://snarfed.org/responses#retweets snarfed.org/responses#retweets])
* {{kylewm}}: https://kylewm.com/share/2014/05/22/1

If you repost a retweet, the proper POSSE behavior is to do a native retweet of that retweet permalink (not the original tweet permalink).

Example repost of a retweet:
* {{kylewm}}: https://kylewm.com/2015/06/repost-of-detlef-kreuz-rt-tarr11-i-want-indieweb
** POSSE retweet permalink: https://twitter.com/kylewmahan/status/615185116214628352

=== POSSE Reposts to Twitter ===
When you do a [[repost]] of an indieweb post:
* look for a [[u-syndication]] hyperlink on the indieweb post permalink page to twitter.com
* if there is such a [[u-syndication]] hyperlink with href linking to a tweet URL
* then
** do a native retweet of that tweet URL on Twitter itself
* else
** consider [[2014/reposts#Reposting_a_post_that_lacks_a_POSSE_tweet|How to POSSE a repost of a post that lacks a POSSE tweet itself]]
* end if

=== POSSE Favorites of Tweets ===
When posting a [[favorite]] of a tweet, the proper POSSE behavior should be to natively favorite (on Twitter) the tweet that you're favoriting on your own site.

Examples:
* [[User:Snarfed.org]] with [[WordPress]] via [[Bridgy]] ([https://snarfed.org/responses#likes snarfed.org/responses#likes])

=== POSSE Favorites to Twitter ===
When you post a [[favorite]] of an indieweb post:
* look for a [[u-syndication]] hyperlink on the indieweb post permalink page to a tweet
* if there is such a [[u-syndication]] hyperlink with href linking to a tweet URL
* then
** natively favorite that tweet URL on Twitter itself
* end if

=== POSSE Follows to Twitter ===
When posting a [[follow]] of either a Twitter profile (@-name), or of an indieweb site that has has a verified (bidirectional) rel=me to a Twitter profile (@-name):
* have your server call the Twitter API to follow that Twitter profile (@-name)
** [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request (to call Twitter API on your behalf for this): [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/550  POSSE following/friending someone new #550]

=== POSSE Updates to Twitter ===
{{main|POSSE#Update}}
Twitter does not support updating / editing posts, thus to POSSE an [[update]] to a post, you must delete the current POSSE tweet and post a new POSSE tweet accordingly.

See this for details on POSSE updates to Twitter (and other non-editable destinations):
* [[POSSE#Update]]

See also:
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/84 Bridgy issue 84: allow updating or deleting a published post] (add a comment if you are looking to implement this, would find this useful)

=== POSSE Deletes to Twitter ===
{{main|POSSE#Delete}}
Twitter supports deleting posts, thus to POSSE a [[delete]] of a post, you must call the Twitter API (or add a comment to [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/84 this issue 84 request for Bridgy let you delete POSSE copies]!)

See this for details on POSSE Deletes to Twitter:
* [[POSSE#Delete]]

== Backfeed from Twitter ==
If you POSSE to Twitter, consider also [[backfeed]]ing (formerly called "reverse syndicating") the [[responses]] to your POSSE copies.

=== Reverse Syndicating At-Replies ===
Per the [[POSSE]] model, you may want to reverse-syndicate @-replies on Twitter to the tweet-copies of your post as "comments" back into your post permalink page on your own site. 

You can use the [[Bridgy]] backfeed service to automatically receive [[Webmention]]s when people @-reply to your tweet copies.

Note that Brid.gy can link to more than one URL in Twitter. You can put an additional URL in the Bio field of the profile, in addition to the one in the website field.

=== Reverse Syndicating Other Responses ===
Using the [[Bridgy]] backfeed service, you can also automatically receive Webmentions when people on Twitter like or retweet your tweet copies. When you receive these webmentions, display them as [[likes]] and [[reposts]] on the permalink of your content on your own site.

== Features ==

* [[signup]] &amp; [[login]] with a email address, user chosen username, password, and optional [[2FA]] (two-factor authentication) via SMS or Twitter Mobile Native App.

=== 2006 original ===
At launch, Twitter provided the roughly following features:

* [[signup]] &amp; [[login]] with a email address, user chosen username, password
** indieweb equivalent: [[signin]] via [[RelMeAuth]] or [[IndieAuth]], TBI multi-factor [[IndieAuth]]
* [[follow]] and [[unfollow]][https://support.twitter.com/articles/15355-how-to-unfollow-users-on-twitter]
* [[reader]] UI with an integrated UI to:
* [[post]] a [[note]] at a [[permalink]]
* [[profile]] page (equivalent of indieweb [[homepage]]) configuration including
** [[icon]]
** name (as displayed next to tweets)
** location (plain text field)
** 160 character bio

This list may be incomplete/imprecise and was done from ~8 year old memory. Please update if you have documentation of specifics!

Screenshot of 2006 sign-in / sign-up screen:

[http://makers.crew.co/chris-messina/ <img src="http://makers.crew.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OG-Twitter.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Screenshot of twttr.com" />]

=== Embedding Tweets ===
Twitter offers copy/paste embed markup on its site that allows one to embed the appearance/text of a tweet in one's own page, as well as [[oEmbed]] option. As both the oEmbed and the embed markup include the text of the tweet in a blockquote, if Twitter shut down, this could continue to display the text minus the appearance.

=== Photo Attribution ===
When a Twitter user includes a link to someone else's photo on Twitter, the Twitter website shows the photographer's name and Twitter account under the photo.

[[File:twitter-photo-attribution.png]]

(Note: the attribution only appears in-stream, not on the Tweet permalink)

=== 2006-11-14 additions ===
On [https://blog.twitter.com/2006/six-more-twitter-updates 2006-11-14 Twitter introduced several features]:
* [[web actions]] on Tweets (then called "Twitter updates" / "Twitters") 
** [[favorite]] button (Twitter's equivalent of [[like]]) and unfavorite any tweet
** [[delete]] post - author-only button
* direct [[message]] anyone who is following you and
** view or delete your previous private messages sent and received as conversations per person
** show count of unread [[message]]s (likely added at same time, but may have been a later enhancement)
* [[search]] over
** authors (people) of posts

=== Replacing ===
If you recreate these features on your own site, including [[POSSE]] support to Twitter for each, then you no longer have any need to directly use Twitter.

To fully replace your usage of Twitter you must also support (roughly ordered by importance, expected frequency of usage)
# import your pre-indieweb tweets to your own domain (accessible via your own site navigation, search, archives).
# on a tweet permalink: (e.g. that you navigated to from a link elsewhere)
#* click "Reply", "Retweet", or "Favorite" and have the action go to your site instead (which then POSSE's it back to Twitter).
# on a Twitter profile page (e.g. that you navigated to from a link elsewhere)
#* click "Follow" or "Unfollow" and have the action take place on your site instead (which your site could POSSE sync to Twitter as well)
# expanded [[search]] for all the use-cases that you currently use Twitter search for. This is likely different for different people and is thus open to some interpretation. Here are some specifics to support [[search]] to replace your usage of Twitter. Support search of:
#* all [[posts]] of from everyone who has posts on your site (just you if you're the only author)
#** only posts from those you follow in your [[reader]] (or just your posts if you lack a reader)
#** only posts with media (e.g. [[photo]] or [[video]] even if just auto-embedded)
#** only "top" posts (make up your own meaning of "top" as Twitter's is undefined)
#** only posts with [[location]] info that are "near you" (make up your own meaning as Twitter's is undefined)
#* authors (people) of posts on your site (just yourself if you only show posts written by you)


The end result is that all your interactions with Twitter and Tweets via your own site need to be <em>at least</em> as seamless as Twitter's UI (so you'll use your own UI instead).

=== Clients ===
Twitter has several clients that all have a fairly complete implementation of the above features:
* web: http://twitter.com/
* mobile web: http://m.twitter.com/
* native [[app]]s on MacOS (e.g. TweetDeck), and [[mobile]] platforms iOS &amp; Android
* SMS - you can sign-up for Twitter and do most actions via SMS. See [http://microformats.org/wiki/twitter-syntax Twitter SMS syntax research].

== iOS client ==

''See full article: [[Twitter-API]]''

The Twitter iOS client has an option to use a different API root, "intended for a Twitter proxy server"

It may be theoretically possible to re-implement enough of the Twitter API on your own site to set your own site as a "Twitter proxy server" and thus use the Twitter client as a client to post directly to your own site (and perhaps read from it as well).


== Issues ==
Correctable issues with Twitter.
=== Fails to hide blocked comments ===
If you [[block]] someone on Twitter (e.g. for abuse), their @-replies still show-up on your tweet permalinks when viewed by other people!

Blocking only hides their @-replies from you.

E.g. if your tweets are public, then any random person (not logged in) viewing your tweets will see abusive @-replies (even though you've blocked them).

See: [[block#Twitter_fails_to_hide_blocked_comments]] for details and screenshots.

=== Photo Upload Size Limit ===
Twitter seems to only allow photos up to 5MB in size.

If you attempt to upload a photo >5MB via the API (e.g. by using [[Bridgy]]) you will get a 400 error and a message like:

<samp>"Image file size must be <= 5242880 bytes"</samp>

In the JSON error structure that is returned.

Related:
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/710 GitHub Bridgy issue 710]

=== Broken Without JS ===
Some of Twitter's [[#Features]] are now (as of 2015-01-08 or before) broken or completely non-functional when JavaScript fails to load or is disabled.

* '''[[follow]] button on profile broken.''' (Follow) button does nothing on profile pages, e.g. https://twitter.com/upcomingorg

This is solvable by following modern [[progressive enhancement]] web development techniques.

=== Dogfooding Fail ===
In a piece [http://eggsbacon.co.nz/twitter_mau Does Twitter's exec team even use Twitter?] (April 2015), a web developer ([https://twitter.com/sidawson @sidawson]) found that 7 of 11 top Twitter executives tweet less than once a day, and most did not use the service before working at Twitter.

This is solvable by having their exec team actually actively use Twitter.

=== New accounts locked for no reason ===
Newly created Twitter accounts (as of some time in 2016) are locked very shortly after being created.

E.g.:
* 2016-10-27 @PostTypeDisc: 
** locked: http://tantek.com/2016/301/t3/why-twitter-growth-stalled-broken-locked
** unlocked an hour later: http://tantek.com/2016/301/t4/your-account-now-unlocked-twitter

Currently this seems to be mostly a time-wasting inconvenience.

=== spammy cross-posting to facebook ===
This may be a side effect of both Twitter and Facebook doing arbitrary photo cropping (FB likes square images, Twitter likes 16:9 wide ones, both often crop rather than fit to space with background).
Kevin Marks posted [https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/486657353744281600a screenshot of Facebook to twitter].
[[File:fbupcomingclone0.png|600px]]

When this was [https://www.facebook.com/kevinmarks/posts/10154414550240425 replicated to facebook by Twitter's app] it looked like this:

[[File:fbupcomingclone.png|600px]]

cropping the screenshot and requiring a clickthrough back to twitter to make it readable, with explicit text added by Twitter when cross-posting: <blockquote>Get the whole picture - <strong>and other photos from Kevin Marks</strong></blockquote> <strong>Emphasis</strong> added - which implies deliberate behavior of a spammy sort (using your cross-post to advertise broader use of Twitter than just that one permalink).

Correctable by fixing cropping issue and spammy text copy.

=== Email Identity Removal ===
This 2013-05-17 screenshot seems to demonstrate an odd interaction and vulnerability on Twitter:

[[File:2013-05-17-twitter-com-new-email-warning.png]]

Screenshot shows a logged in Twitter profile page (http://twitter.com/t) with a yellow warning box just below the global black toolbar that says: <blockquote>New email address required. Twitter has removed the email address from your account, by request of the email owner.<br/>Please [https://twitter.com/settings/account?change_email=true enter a new email address] where you can be reached. [https://support.twitter.com/articles/82050-i-m-having-trouble-confirming-my-email Learn more  ›]</blockquote> 

Hyperlinks as present in original.  No such warning on m.twitter.com equivalent page when logged in (i.e. on a mobile device).

It's not clear how this happened, how the email address was revoked, how to avoid having it revoked in the future etc.

Appears to be an [[identity]] threat/vulnerability.

* http://tantek.com/2013/137/b1/ux-learn-more-links-warning-boxes-three-things

=== Cannot change username when account is suspended ===
If your account is suspended, you cannot change your username. If you attempt to change your username, the web interface sometimes partially reflects the change, and a file <code>json.json</code> is downloaded containing the text: 

<pre>{"errors":[{"code":64,"message":"Your account is suspended and is not permitted to access this feature."}]}</pre>

=== Misprioritizing reply notifications ===
Per 2016-03-10 {{kevinmarks}} <cite>[http://known.kevinmarks.com/2016/twitters-tragedy-of-the-comments Twitter's Tragedy of the Comments]</cite>: <blockquote>The most egregious of these was making @ replies the primary notification, and the Big Red Number on the app on iOS. Suddenly, it was another email inbox where others' priorities were ranked above your own choices.</blockquote>

This may be resolvable by providing an option to only show e.g. unread direct messages as the Big Red Number, instead of all notifications, replies, @-mentions etc.

=== Sells malicious ads ===

}}

=== Breaks RelMeAuth ===
Around 2018-05-21, Twitter changed profile pages to load with Javascript. As a result the [[rel-me]] links no longer appear in the source HTML so it cannot be used for [[RelMeAuth]].

When Javascript is disabled, twitter.com shows the message "We've detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser. Would you like to proceed to legacy Twitter?" Clicking "Yes" takes you to mobile.twitter.com.

[[File:twitter-no-js-2018-05-22.png]]

== Criticism ==
Bad or failing behavior on the part of Twitter that is unlikely to be resolvable. Roughly sorted by most problematic / frequently so first.

Is it something that there's a possible and likely way that Twitter can resolve it? Add it to [[#Issues]] instead

=== Poor handling of abuse ===
Twitter unfortunately has a long, well documented, history of poor handling of abuse, from:
* 2018-12-19<cite>[https://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/troll-patrol/findings#what_did_we_find_container]</cite>
**A research study by Amnesty International found female journalists and politicians face abuse on Twitter every 30 seconds.
* 2008-05-22: <cite>[http://arielwaldman.com/2008/05/22/twitter-refuses-to-uphold-terms-of-service/ Twitter refuses to uphold Terms of Service]</cite>

* 2014-08-12 <cite>[http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/08/12/twitterfail-twitters-refusal-handle-online-stalkers-abusers-haters/ #TwitterFail: Twitter’s Refusal to Handle Online Stalkers, Abusers, and Haters]</cite>

Twitter's UX now makes it easier to post abusive content, than protect oneself from the same.

Past behavior here shows it is unlikely Twitter has sufficient incentive or ability to solve this problem.

=== Developer Relations ===
Twitter built their entire business on top of the developer community. Almost all Twitter features were originally from Twitter clients, such as Retweets and Hashtags. Closing sections of their API and RSS feeds has made the developer community lose trust in Twitter.
* 2015-03-15 Sarah Kessler / FastCompany: <cite>[http://www.fastcompany.com/3043716/sxsw/twitter-only-gave-meerkat-2-hours-notice-before-cutting-access-to-the-social-graph Twitter Only Gave Meerkat 2 Hours Notice Before Cutting Access To The Social Graph]</cite> via [https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/577634498193461248]

Unlikely that Twitter will take any actions to resolve this long term trend.

=== Lack of Communities ===
* [https://alexgaynor.net/2014/oct/30/i-hope-twitter-goes-away/ Alex Gaynor discusses his problems with twitter], which mostly center around the inability to define and interact within a self-moderating community, unlike most other social media (and IRC).

<blockquote>
Twitter has no mechanisms for <nowiki>[defining a community]</nowiki>. Every user floats by themselves, interacting with who they please. This denies us the ability to build communities, to set social norms, and to enforce them. Twitter has absolutely no way for me to share with others that someone isn't a person I want in my communities
</blockquote>

=== Lack of usernames ===
Per https://twitter.com/webster/status/697984790323007488 the suggested usernames have become seemingly random long strings of letters and numbers:

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ca-9ZNSVIAE6hEm.png

=== Amplifies low value content ===
As criticized in this tweet (ironically)
* https://twitter.com/AbrasiveGhost/status/639601942973562880 <blockquote>SON: Dad whats Twitter <br/><br/>ME: u know when one dog barks & every single one in the area starts howling? <br/><br/>SON: ya <br/><br/>ME: its like that but all day</blockquote>

Retweets encourage viral and angry content.

=== Lots of UI revisions ===
Look for #newtwitter and #newnewtwitter 

=== UI 2011 ===
Circa 2011 styling of Twitter stream and tweet permalink:

[http://www.dafont.com/forum/read/33869/what-font-does-twitter-use http://www.dafont.com/forum/attach/orig/8/4/84660.png]

Ignore the red borders / boxes - those were there to indicate/ask a question about those items.

Showing Arial (presumably on Microsoft Windows) for tweet text in a stream, and Georgia for tweet text on a tweet permalink page.

=== UI 2014-04 ===
As of 2014-04, Twitter has yet another UI revision, this time nearly cloning [[Facebook]] profile pages' look & feel:

[https://twitter.com/genmon/status/459257786875265025 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bl-chggIMAAGyBZ.png]

Facebook on the left, new Twitter UI on the right.

If you don't see the image inline above (e.g. only see the text Bl-chggIMAAGyBZ.png) then click on the Twitter link to see it on their site.

=== 2017 Character Limit Increase to 280 ===
In 2017, Twitter slowly rolled out the ability to post a tweet with up to 280 characters. Instead of counting down from 140, the new character counter is a circular progress bar that fills as you approach 280, turning into a countdown at 20 characters remaining.

== Additional Resources ==
=== Profile Image URLs ===
Programmatically, the official way to get a Twitter user's profile image is to use the
<code>profile_image_url</code> and <code>profile_image_url_https</code> fields returned by the [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/users/show users/show] v1.1 API call. [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/user-profile-images-and-banners More details.]

Unfortunately, those fields are absolute URLs for the *current* profile image, and usually break when the user changes their profile image.

Twitter profile images can also be found by choosing "View Image" on context menu on a profile, those URLs may end with:
* _normal.png - 48px square
* _200x200.png - 200px square
* _400x400.png - 400px square
* or no "_" and just .png - actual uploaded size
You can change any of the above suffixes to any others in order to get a few different sizes.

==== Avatars IO workaround ====
avatars.io is an unofficial alternative that serves the current profile picture, eg:
* <code><nowiki>http://avatars.io/twitter/username</nowiki></code>

==== Unofficial Twitter image redirect ====
{{warning|Warning this no longer works in web browsers viewing web pages, thus unsuitable for use in plain HTML.}}

This unofficial unsupported twitter.com URL used to work well, but now (as of early 2019) redirects to a "not found" page in browsers. It still 302 redirects to the correct image for non-browser fetches though.

* <code><nowiki>https://twitter.com/username/profile_image?size=original</nowiki></code><br> 

If you omit <code>?size=original</code> from the former, or replace it with <code>?size=normal</code>, you get a 48x48 image instead of the original size.

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to delete your account ===
TBD.

Has anyone deleted their Twitter account? What's the process? How long do they hold your data anyway? Etc.

== Defunct ==
=== Tweetcc ===
As of 2015-12-15, <span id="CC_license_your_tweets">Tweetcc</span>(.)com redirects to a spam blog on [[Wordpress.com]].

''Note, tweetcc's creators decided to take it down in July 2013.''[https://twitter.com/Malarkey/status/361844728922259457]

'''We're looking into having tweetcc restored.'''[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-10-21/line/1382391670]

You used to be able to use the site <nowiki>http://www.tweetcc.com/</nowiki> to Creative Commons license your tweets.[http://tantek.com/2012/230/t1/tweetcc-cc-license-tweets-quote-embed-indieweb]

This allows anyone else wanting to:
* copy
* quote
* syndicate
Etc. your tweets to do so, per that CC license (e.g. CC-BY, attributing you) independent of Twitter's TOS, and thus independent of any Twitter requirements, e.g. their display "guidelines".
