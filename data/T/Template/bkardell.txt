Hey there!

I'm Brian Kardell and my website is [https://bkardell.com bkardell.com].  I'm a developer advocate at [https://igalia.com Igalia], a worker owned cooperative which has been called [https://thenewstack.io/igalia-the-open-source-powerhouse-youve-never-heard-of/?utm_content=bufferc4a6b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer The Open Source Powerhouse You've Never Heard Of]. We're top contributors to all of the browser engines (like, literally #1 most commits after the steward org many years) and several other important open source projects and currently acting as the stewards for WPEWebKit, the Wolvic XR Browser and Servo.
