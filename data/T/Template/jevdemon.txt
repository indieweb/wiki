__NOTITLE__
= John Evdemon = 
== Intro ==
Software architect, CTO, consultant, author, editor, and developer/leader of various industry and web standards. Yes, I still enjoy writing code.

== Websites ==
My poor, neglected blog is currently limping along on an outdated, poorly configured version of [[Known]] instance at [https://k.evdemon.org]. I hope to get this mess cleaned up soon. 

__TOC__
== Working On ==
* Cleaning up my website, upgrading to latest version of [[Known]]
* Hoping to get more involved with IndieWeb standards. I've spent a lot of time leading and developing web and industry standards at organizations like [https://w3.org W3C], [https://oasis-open.org OASIS], [https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/standards UNCEFACT], and many others. I'd love to assist IndieWeb with standards development if such opportunities arise.

== Itches ==
=== Known ===
* Fix my messy, outdated installation by upgrading to the latest version.
* Add proper home and about pages
* Add structure to my blog so that entries are better formatted. I <i>really</i> like Dave Winer's [https://scripting.org microblogging format] and would love to develop a template or plugin to enable this format with [[Known]].
* Contribute to installation and hosting documentation, making it easier for new users to adopt and use the platform.
=== Freedom Controller ===
* [https://github.com/daveajones Dave Jones] has [https://github.com/daveajones/cartulary/blob/master/README.md built a very interesting "digital archiver"] that I would love to get integrated with my site and potentially add some IndieWeb capabilites to.
