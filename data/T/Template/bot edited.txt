This template marks markup that is maintained by a bot. Please do not manually change the contents and do not remove this template unless you are sure the content should not be automatically changed anymore and the automation can handle this happening. 

Bot developers can use the TemplateSandbox functionality to have the contents quickly wrapped in something easily identifieable when parsing the page.
