The '''<dfn>Time-based One-time Password Algorithm</dfn>''' ('''TOTP''') is a mechanism of generating a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time, often used for [[two-factor authentication]].

== Services that Support TOTP ==
* [[GitHub]] - GitHub uses TOTP for two-factor auth when signing in
* [[Google]] - Google uses TOTP for two-factor auth when signing in
* [[indieauth.com]] - indieauth.com used to support TOTP as a login mechanism
