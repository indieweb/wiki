The '''<dfn>Time-based One-time Password Algorithm</dfn>''' ('''TOTP''') is a mechanism of generating a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time, often used for [[two-factor authentication]].

== One Time Password ==
(stub, could be expanded into its own page, [[one time password]], and redirects fixed accordingly)

The more general concept of a <dfn>one time password</dfn> can be generated in other ways, and is sometimes communicated via email.

== Services that Support TOTP ==
* [[GitHub]] - GitHub uses TOTP for two-factor auth when signing in
* [[Google]] - Google uses TOTP for two-factor auth when signing in
* [[indieauth.com]] - indieauth.com used to support TOTP as a login mechanism
