'''<dfn>[https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81254224 The Social Dilemma]</dfn>''' is a 2020 [[Netflix]] docudrama that critiques [[social media]] silos, and their use of [[recommendation engine]]s in [[algorithmic feed]]s to amplify addictive behaviors in their users to maximize [[advertising]] business models, though presented from the viewpoints of former [[silo]] employees who have since turned into critics, while neglecting long-standing critical activists.

** "The reason careless errors like this are important is because, as science and technology scholars teach us, tech is not created in a social vacuum. It is built within, and often reifies, power structures. By ignoring that lesson, we keep those power structures in place" [https://twitter.com/beccalew @beccalew] September 16, 2020
