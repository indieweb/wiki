'''<dfn>[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-polls Twitter Poll]</dfn>''' is a [[Twitter]] feature that lets you post a poll [[question]] with up to four answers for people to choose from. Twitter polls run for 24 hours by default but can be set to run between 5 minutes and 7 days.

==Polling interface==

To create a Twitter poll, a user starts a new tweet, selects the poll button, and is presented with a view that asks for a question, two responses (with the ability to add up to two more), and a duration.

After a poll is created, the owner sees a results view:

Followers see a choices view:

When presented with a poll, followers can 1) select a poll choice and/or 2) add commentary with a reply. After selecting a choice, the current results of the poll are shown.
