'''<dfn>Related Reading</dfn>''' is a feature of some blogging [[silo]]s (like [[Medium]], [[Wordpress.com]]) where at the end of a blog post, the system suggests another deemed-likely-interesting-to-you given your assumed interest in the topic that you just read about.

== Why ==
=== Smoother cross-article reading experience ===
Related reading provides a smoother experience for people reading content across sites. It allows readers to go seamlessly from one post to the next, even from a different author, without having to deal with a new site, adapting to a new layout & navigation, etc.
=== Enables just keep scrolling ===
In Wordpress.com and Medium, they go as far as to pick the next most-likely-interesting post and simply append it to the one you're reading -- meaning that the reader just keeps scrolling, reading as many articles as s/he wants without even needing to click on a link.  This stream-style interface seems to be a very effective [[UX]] for keeping readers' attention.

It's a different UI on links, one that has no "UI" beyond scrolling.

=== Reach a broader audience ===
You should enable your posts to show up in other sites's related reading sections if you care about the ideas inside the post reaching a broader audience.
=== Silo UX parity ===
By providing a Related Reading feature that shows other indieweb articles, you can provide the benefit of a smoother cross-site experience without your readers having to use a silo.

By enabling your posts to be syndicated into others indieweb sites's Related Reading feature, you enable those sites to similarly provide as smooth as (or better) an experience than silos.

== Brainstorming ==
* how to publish an article that can be included in others's Related Reading features:
** use [[h-entry]]. basically anything you would do to make your posts readable in an indieweb [[reader]] should make them readable in Related Reading sections too!

* how to provide a Related Reading feature with articles from other indieweb sites
** how do you pick which sites get articles from? whitelist? manual curation
** how do you figure out what articles from another site are related to yours, or similarly interesting? would a [[recommendation engine]] help?
** consider providing a JS-required related reading feature so that others's content that you display DOES NOT get indexed by search engines as being on your site.
