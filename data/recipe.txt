'''<dfn>recipe</dfn>''' is special kind of post, that typically has a name, like [[articles]] do, a list of ingredients, and a list of instructions for making something, usually [[food]] or drink.

== Why ==
Consider posting recipes for food or drink that you come up with that you think your friends will enjoy.

== How ==
Post an [[h-entry]] as you would for any other kind of post.

If your recipe has a name use "p-name" for it.

Put an [[h-recipe]] inside that lists the ingredients, steps, etc.

== IndieWeb Examples (h-recipe) ==

Marked up as [[h-recipe]].
