* I have worked with several Joomla installations over the years (all in 1.x and 1.5.x versions) and found it to be a pain in the neck. The terminology and structure of the code in its MVC is confusing and relatively simple tasks have taken longer than necessary. I have dealt with several security problems and hacked installations â€” including a site that was being used as part of a botnet. Perhaps the core code is no less secure than other CMS (bugs happen), but I feel like there's a disproportionate amount of headaches for Joomla, perhaps because it encourages poor server practices. I won't pretend to be unbiased, here. I loathe Joomla and strongly recommend not using it. {{gRegor}}
