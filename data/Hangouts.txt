'''<dfn>[https://google.com/hangouts Hangouts]</dfn>''' is [[Google]]'s messaging tool that supports chat, groups, SMS/MMS (on Android), and videoconferencing.

Creating public video hangouts has resulted in hangout [[spam]] in the past — typically this takes the form of random people popping up in your hangout and groaning, shouting or making other loud noises.

Fortunately hangouts need not be made public — anyone can join a “private” hangout given the URL.

== How to set up a hangout for remote participation ==
* Go to Google+
* In “hangouts” (top right as of 2013-09), create a new hangout
* Add at least one person to the hangout
* In the new hangout window, copy the URL
* People can now join by visiting that URL — paste it into a [[note]], event etherpad or [[IRC]] or all of the above
