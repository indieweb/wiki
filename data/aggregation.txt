If you are joining the indieweb, one thing you may miss is feedback. At this stage, you can't just hit "Interactions" at the top of your site and see who has interacted with your post.

This page is to collect a list of services you can poll to see your content being shared, so that we can eventually build more compelling ways to interact with the sharing of indieweb content.
