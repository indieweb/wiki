==== [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-02-25 Tuesday 25th Feb] ====

* Discussion about microformatted markup making it easier for feed readers to parse the html that they get in atom/rss
* cweiske appears to be suggesting that we focus on APIs, rather than simply microformats.
* Tantek found that ATOM is much bigger than just html for posts. “hence my Atom feed only has 3 items now, while my home page has 16.”
* Discussion about atom/rss versus html + microformats. There were concerns about performance (lots of people querying an index.html page). Tantek points out h-feed (http://indiewebcamp.com/h-feed) in response.
* There’s talk of superfeedr.com for PuSH
* A few people are now adding h-feed to their sites in order to better support the in-development indie-readers.
