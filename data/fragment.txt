    A '''<dfn>fragment</dfn>''' is part of a URL, and typically refers to a fragment identifier at the end of a URL preceded by a # but may also refer to a [[media fragment]] which may use a fragment identifier or a query string.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Webmention and fragments ===
The development of [[marginalia]] has demonstrated that [[Webmention]] can be used to comment on specific parts of the content of a post.

This likely makes sense to document explicitly as a Webmention extension, i.e.:
* Webmention Fragment support
** How and when a webmention sender should use a fragment in the source and or target URLs
** How should a webmention receiver handle a fragment in the source and or target URLs

Where a fragment could be:
* plain old URL fragment to an element with that ID in the HTML
* [[fragmention]]
* [[media fragment]]
