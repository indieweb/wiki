== IndieWeb movement and terminology ==
'''2010:''' The IndieWeb "movement" (as much as two people getting together and naming something is a "movement") was started by:
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{t}}
after they both attended the 2010-07-18 [[Federated Social Web Summit]] in Portland, Oregon and decided what they wanted was a different focus, a focus on:
* [[creators]] instead of talkers - people that create design/UX/code instead of just email/chat about it.
* [[selfdogfooding]] - using your creations on your own website that represents your primary self
* [[own your data]] - owning what you author by publishing it first on your own site, and only later copying to silos

{{t}} and {{aaronpk}} decided to use the term "IndieWeb" or phrase "Indie Web" to refer to this new focus and effort. 

== IndieWebCamp founded ==
'''2011:''' The next year they joined forces with {{caseorganic}} & {{crystal}} and organized the [[2011|first IndieWebCamp in Portland Oregon]] on 2011-06-25 and 2011-06-26.
