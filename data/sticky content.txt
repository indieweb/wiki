{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Sticky content</dfn>''' refers to the practice of deliberate website content creation (and design) to motivate readers of a website (often commercial and/or ad-driven, such as many [[silos]]) to hold readers's attention (hence sticky), for increasing amounts of time, and to return (frequently).

Similarly named, but different in meaning, a "sticky post" is another way of saying [[pinned]] post.
