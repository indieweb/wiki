The '''<dfn>Twitter API</dfn>''' is a [[proprietary]] [[API]] for accessing [[Twitter]] content and services.

== Twitter for iOS ==
[https://ios.twitter.com Twitter for iOS] ([https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271 in Apple's App Store]) is an official "native" client app provided by [http://twitter.com Twitter.com]

=== Custom API root ===
The Twitter iOS client has an option to use a different API root, "intended for a Twitter proxy server".

It may be theoretically possible to re-implement enough of the Twitter API on your own site to set your own site as a "Twitter proxy server" and thus use the Twitter client as a client to post directly to your own site (and perhaps read from it as well).
