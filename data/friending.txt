'''<dfn>friending</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>add friend</dfn> or the verb to <dfn>friend</dfn>) is a general term applied to the various [[silo]] user interactions with sites regarding reciprocal friendship. E.g.:
* add people as friends (AKA "follow", e.g. on [[Twitter]])
* request a reciprocal friendship (e.g. "+1 Add Friend" on [[Facebook]])

While related, simply <em>listing</em> or publishing a list of friends/contacts is not really "friending", as there isn't any kind of active UI / action that the user takes. It's more just another form of publishing. Examples / technology for friends lists:
* [[blogroll]]
* [[XFN]]
