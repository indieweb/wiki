'''<dfn>SASS</dfn>''' is a Stylesheet Language that extends [[CSS]] and is compiled into CSS before publishing. 
It [http://sass-lang.com describes itself] as "CSS with superpowers"

Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance. 

== Partials ==

Partials are SASS files that contain pieces of CSS code that you can include in other SASS files. This allows for modularity and improve maintenance.
