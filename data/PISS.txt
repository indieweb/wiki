'''<dfn>PISS</dfn>''' is a backronym for Personal Information Storage and Syndication, [[User:jenmontes.com|Jen Montes]]'s IndieWeb implementation of a note-taking and retrieval system. The motivation for creating PISS stemmed from frustrations with the portability of data captured in [[Evernote]]. 

PISS combines [[Tent]] ideas about having a single repository of information for all aspects of your life (rather than compartmentalizing status updates to one platform, blog posts to another, etc.), with [[Indie Web Camp]] ideas about syndication and intercommunication.

== Planned Features ==
From Tent:
* [[RESTful]] architecture that allows posts to be manipulated with an HTTP interface
* Keeps concerns of the server (data storage and retrieval) separate from concerns of clients (user experience)
* Easily allows for the addition of new post types
* Posts are private by default
* Faceted search across all posts

From Indie Web Camp:
* Marking up HTML data with [[microformats]] to make content more meaningful
* The ability to POSSE to other platforms
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[Webmention]]s

From personal itches:
* Display a resource in either HTML, JSON, or XML

== Development ==
PISS is fully open source and dedicated to the public domain. A [https://github.com/jenmontes/piss repository for the source code] is hosted on [[GitHub]]. 

At the moment, PISS is an extension of the [http://python-eve.org/ Eve] framework for REST APIs. Since PISS is still in very early stages, the repository is the best place for updates and additional information.
