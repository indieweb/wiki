'''<dfn>Foodspotting</dfn>''' is a social [[silo]] for posting consumption of [[food]] and drink (which they call <dfn>spotting</dfn> and individual posts <dfn>spots</dfn>) and optionally any or all of [[venue|where]] (thus making it an actual [[checkin]]), whether you like it or love it, a [[photo]], and [[review]] commentary. Users can view each other's "spots" and mark it a "great shot" or if they "want" to try it. Users earn "expert titles" if they rate/consume certain things. Users can also assemble guides or want lists.

== Examples ==
* Post with food, photo, venue, rating: http://www.foodspotting.com/reviews/5695903
* Profile and activity feed: http://www.foodspotting.com/186779

== Features ==
* Entering a new food item suggests items from an autocomplete list and gives you the option to add the text you entered if it was not found
* Creating a post requires tagging a venue for the post
* Creating a post requires adding a photo
* Posts have a comment button as well as a "great shot" and "great find" reaction buttons
* The "create draft" feature works with no network connection, and the autocomplete lists are limited to things you have entered on the phone before
* The date used for the post is based on the date the photo was taken (for example when posting a photo from a month ago, the post shows the older date, and that it was created today)

== Criticism ==
* API access requires that you submit a description of the application you are creating and is manually reviewed before getting access to the API.

==[[PESOS]]==
Posting to Foodspotting, via their app, is easy but getting your content out is a little trickier. They do offer standard "share" options but nothing automatic.

[[User:Davidjohnmead.com]] uses the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpematico/ WpeMatico plugin] for [[WordPress]] to watch his Foodspotting RSS feeds. When a new entry appears it creates a post on his [http://davidjohnmead.com/blog blog].

You can find the Foodspotting RSS feed for your posts by adding .rss to your profile URL -

As you can enter custom HTML when the WpeMatico plugin creates the post David Mead inserts the link back to the original post with rel="me".
