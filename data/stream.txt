A '''<dfn>stream</dfn>''' refers to a collection of [[posts]], typically time-ordered, similar to a [[feed]], but updated in real-time, with updates propagated via a notification-based protocol like [[PuSH]], and published as HTML ([[hAtom]]/[[h-entry]]).

A [[composite stream]] includes multiple post types.
