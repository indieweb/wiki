Below are some notes on various hosting providers. Plans and technology change, so be sure to check details. 

(Original document from [[Darius Dunlap]] for his own decision process. Just hoping it's helpful to others)

See also [[web_hosting]] for great info about hosting types and who uses what.


'''WPEngine''' - http://wpengine.com/plans/

$99/mo professional plan allows up to 10 wordpress installs and does SNI, though I’d probably want the extra $5/mo dedicated IP address so that I can have my own certs. (Need to look into that in more detail if I decide to consider this provider.)

Limited other capabilities outside of WP. 



'''Pair''' 

http://www.pair.com

Shared hosting:

http://www.pair.com/services/web_hosting/

VPS starting at $79/mo:

http://www.pair.com/services/vps/

SSL Support seems complicated and maybe the certs are only available through them? (expensive!)

SSL can be purchased and used with Basic, Advanced, Webmaster, Developer, and all High Volume hosting plans for a one-time $20 setup fee and a $10 per month fee. Individuals with QuickServe® dedicated servers can add SSL for a one-time setup fee of $20. QuickServe® dedicated servers are not charged a monthly fee for SSL.

Website does not provide a lot of easily accessible detail, but they've been around forever and are well regarded by many folks. It's unclear, for example, if they support SNI.

Management of servers is much more complex than shared hosting systems. Much like manually managing a linux box. 


'''Linode'''

$20/mo for a pretty beefy VPS on SSD

Very capable, but this is a bare linux server VPS (with some nice mgmt tools) that you have to manage yourself. 

SSL support sounds strong

Good DNS configurability, of course:
