The '''<dfn>WordPress Outreach Club</dfn>''' is a group of active [[IndieWebCamp]] participants who reach out to individuals already running [[WordPress]] to add [[IndieWeb functionality]] to their existing sites. This would include people who have actively requested assistance in converting as well as people who might be amenable to the suggestion.

The Club was founded as an effort within IndieWebCamp on 2014-11-07. As of 2015-07-21, the Club has a [https://github.com/IndieWebCamp-WordPress-Outreach-Club place] on Github.

<blockquote>Not sure why, but @indiewebcamp theme/plugins in Wordpress don't seem to be giving me 2-way comments...was working before.</blockquote>



== Successes ==
Successful handling of requests! Move from "Requests" to here upon satisfaction by the requester.

Unsure if success as David Peach switched away from WordPress for his site.
