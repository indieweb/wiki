A '''<dfn>podcast</dfn>''' is an episodic series of [[audio]] and/or [[video]] posts that can be subscribed to and downloaded for [[offline]] listening/viewing.

== Why ==
Why should you have a podcast? Some people like listening to them when:
* walking / running / [[exercising]] in general
* driving, e.g. on a roadtrip
* commuting (by any method)

== How ==
[[iTunes]] (proprietary) and [[RSS]]/[[Atom]] are the dominant ways to publish and consume podcast feeds.

=== How to publish ===
Publish a [[RSS]]/[[Atom]] with podcast audio inside media enclosures, and/or use [[iTunes]].

=== How to consume ===
Podcasts are RSS/Atom/XML feeds where, normally, the media of the podcast is linked to with an enclosure tag
eg: <enclosure url="http://example.com/podcast01.mp3" length="259429328" type="audio/mpeg" />

However, most podcasts also include a number of other iTunes specific tags to ensure itunes will subscribe to them easily, eg <itunes:summary>. Some of these itunes tags are usually just replications of the data in other tags in the item.

Most podcast players both consume podcast feeds and play podcast audio. [[iTunes]] is the primary player on OS X and iOS. Other platforms have other players, e.g. [http://beyondpod.com/ BeyondPod] on [[Android]].

Some podcasts only publish on iTunes. You can subscribe to them in other players with hacks like [http://picklemonkey.net/feedflipper-home/ Feed Flipper].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb examples of personal podcast publishing and consuming

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} has published podcasts on werd.io using [[Known]]
* First 2014-11-02: http://werd.io/2014/the-top-podcasts-are-professional-but-everyones-voice-should-be
* An RSS feed of all posts tagged #podcastsunday: http://werd.io/content/all/?q=%23podcastsunday&_t=rss

=== Acegiak ===
{{acegiak}} consumes podcasts through her reader [[Whisperfollow]] which aggregates RSS and, if they are marked up with podcast media tags, embeds the media for consumption and provides a link to save or open in another window

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has published a podcast on http://latenighttoast.com using [[ProcessWire]]
* First 2015-05-07: http://latenighttoast.com/episodes/001-episode-305/
* Generating the RSS feed [http://latenighttoast.com/xml-feed/] on the same domain so that we can control the canonical URL of the feed after submitting it to iTunes.
* Using [[archive.org]] to host the MP3s.
* Using URLs on the same domain that redirect to the archive.org MP3s, again so that we control the canonical URL of the MP3. This also gives us the ability to roughly track the number of streams/downloads of each episode.

== Other Examples ==
=== Wavelist ===
[[Wavelist]] is a collection of podcast episodes curated into playlists by individuals.

== Distribution ==
There are number of services for distributing your podcast without having to make copies (thus different from [[POSSE]] / syndication in general).

=== Huffduffer ===
[[Huffduffer]] is a bookmarking service for podcasts and audio / music / speech in general.

To submit your podcast to Huffduffer, create an account, submit your podcast with various tags.

Users of Huffduffer can then find your podcast by tag.

=== iTunes ===
[[iTunes]] is a service and application from [[Apple]] for music, video, podcasts and other multimedia. Podcasts distributed by iTunes are made easily discoverable and subscribable in:
* MacOS "iTunes" application
* iOS "Podcasts" application

==== Submitting to iTunes for distribution ====
See: [https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html How to Submit a Podcast] at apple.com

When submitting a podcast URL to iTunes, be sure to submit a URL on a domain that you control. For example, if using [[Libsyn]] to host your podcast mp3s, don't submit the RSS URL that they provide. Instead, host a page on your domain that sends a "302 Found" temporary redirect to the Libsyn URL. 

== Changing podcast hosting providers ==

=== Podcast URL under your control ===

If your podcast URL is on your own domain, then you can just change the 302 redirect to point to the new hosting provider.

=== Podcast URL not under your control ===
If your podcast URL is not on your own domain, then the ability to change your URL is limited by whether your current host allows you to.

Libsyn has a writeup of [http://support.libsyn.com/faqs/changing-your-feed-url-in-itunes/ how to change your feed URL]. 

Essentially the process involves setting an additional property in the feed URL.

<pre>
<itunes:new-feed-url>http://newsite.example.com/podcast.rss</itunes:new-feed-url>
</pre>
