{{stub}}

'''<dfn>featured</dfn>''' is a proposed mf2 property (typically as <code>u-featured</code>) for [[h-entry]] that indicates a representative image for a primarily textual post.

== Why ==
To indicate which image (among many potentially) should be used in [[summaries]] or other [[link-preview]] use-cases for a post.

== How ==
Add the class name "u-featured" to the <nowiki><img></nowiki> tag that you want used as the featured image for your post.
