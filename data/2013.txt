=== to-do ===
This is our unordered "to-do" (GTD next-actions) list for IndieWebCamp 2013. Strike and sign done items and move them to the [[#done|done]] section.

Let's move and organize most of these to '''[[2013/Planning]].'''

* <s>create Calagator event and add it to the lanyrd, plancast links above (and on [[Main_Page]] and on [[Guest_List]].</s>
** <s>tried importing into Calagator, awaiting [http://code.google.com/p/calagator/issues/detail?id=471 issue 471] resolution. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 18:04, 27 March 2013 (PDT)</s>

* create the [[2013/Sessions]] and [[2013/Schedule]] pages from 2012 equivalents.

* Add target audience (Who is this event for?) for web developers & designers. 
* check for 2011 or 2012 pages in the sidebar (via redirects) and fix accordingly

* Find [[Sponsors]], advertise them through Twitter. 
* Add Login / Register on top left of nav bar, so it's easier to find.

* Process Andi Galpern's https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKHAbNfTtyGeVte1WawBPAWHzs_NHwVrsVftZ5OR3iI/edit into discrete inline actions here.

* buy a bunch of the large sticky note pads (multiple colors is good, extras to share with OSBridge even better)
* find a place to order Hello My URL is stickers (good to have a supply and suppliers on hand)
** maybe ask on Twitter for local Portland sticker people
** or create a template for sticker printing on sticker stationery from a stationery store / OfficeMax / Office Depot
*** be sure to include Name, URL, other URLs (gtalk, twitter, github), and "IndieWebCamp.com/2013" on it.
