'''<dfn>[http://runkeeper.com/ RunKeeper]</dfn>''' is an [[exercise]] [[silo]] and native app for keeping track of running, biking and other physical activity.

== Criticism ==
=== Requires login to view public run info ===
If someone shares info on a particular run, in order to view the details, e.g. splits per mile, RunKeeper requires that you login.

=== http only ===
RunKeeper appears to <em>only</em> support http, even for logins.

Using an https URL just redirects to the http version without an error.

This implies that they have enough [[https]] support (e.g. a valid certificate) but are <em>choosing</em> not to use it to actually server web pages.

Shouldn't everything (especially the login page) be served over https??</blockquote>
