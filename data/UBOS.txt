'''<dfn>UBOS</dfn>''' (pronounced You-Boss) is a new [[Linux]] distro that aims to make it much simpler to deploy server-side web applications on headless hardware owned by users. 

Even geeks often have a hard time finding out how to [[install]] web apps, or regularly backing them up or upgrading them. 

For non-geeks, it's totally impossible, which is one of the reasons they need to go to the big [[silos]] instead of the [[indieweb]]. 

UBOS is intended to make this much more accessible to geeks and humans, so everybody can have their own site under they own control.

== Features ==
UBOS fully supports:
* multiple virtual hosts, and 
* multiple independent installations of the same app at different virtual hostnames or paths. 

This enables a family, for example, to run independent websites for each family member at different hostnames but with overlapping applications.

=== Apps available on UBOS ===
As of 2014-11-24:
* [[Owncloud]]: Your Cloud, Your Data, Your Way!
* [[Known]]: Publishing Platform for Everyone
* [[WordPress]]: Blog tools, publishing platform, and CMS, plus indie web plugins
* [[Mediawiki]]: The wiki that Wikipedia runs on
* [[Selfoss]]: The new multipurpose rss reader, live stream, mashup, aggregation web application
* [[Shaarli]]: Your Own URL Shortener
Each of these apps can be fully installed at a virtual host of the user's choosing with a single command. There is no need to edit configuration files, manually provision databases, or restart services.

== Releases ==
UBOS uses a rolling-release model, which means that no "major" upgrades are ever required. UBOS also uses several release channels that contain software with different levels of maturity.

The UBOS release process tests the entire stack: operating system, middleware, and the installation, uninstallation, backup, restore and (some) functionality of web apps included in UBOS.
