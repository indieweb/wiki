== Itches ==
* Fix my DNS records - I made a mess of it and my site is currently unreachable. :)
* Finish upgrade to latest release of Known and work out all the kinks. Verify everything is working with [https://indiewebify.me/ indiewebify.me].
* Post longer-form content on a more regular basis (not just tweets)
* Set up an IndieReader so I can stop using InnoReader
* Integrate with [https://github.com/daveajones/cartulary/blob/master/README.md Freedom Controller] (perhaps via a new Known plugin?)
* Get Known's LinkedIn plugin working again - it has been deprecated and hasn't been maintained. Create a PR for Known once I get it working and fully tested. 
* More to come
