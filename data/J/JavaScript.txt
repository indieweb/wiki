=== Sites break without Javascript ===
Javascript seems to have engendered web development methodologies that depend on it. Many sites seem to break without it, become inaccessible.
* http://sighjavascript.tumblr.com/ provides examples of sites that do poorly without javascript

Although it is unlikely that visitors of your site still use a browser that does not support javascript as a technology, there are situations in which this is relevant to you as a webmaster. 

* A search engine crawler indexes your site: they may not index text content unless it is accessible without javascript.
** Google's crawler runs at least some javascript these days.
** HOWEVER, as of 2014-10-27 Google ''still'' says [http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/10/updating-our-technical-webmaster.html Make sure your web design adheres to the principles of progressive enhancement]
* A visitor of your website uses a javascript blocker like [https://noscript.net/ noscript], which people sometimes do to [https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/freejs avoid directly consuming proprietary software].
* A visitor to your site is using an older browser with an incompatible implementation of javascript. Rather than shimming your code to work with these browsers, you can just make your site work without JS. See: [http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard Cutting the Mustard]
* [https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/ Maybe we could tone down the JavaScript] on eev.ee has an exhaustive list of situations in which javascript may be unavailable or a site visitorâ€™s experience may be hampered by javascript

=== More Fragile Than HTML ===
Many sites now depend on Javascript to generate the page in a browser, rather than generating the page on the server and sending HTML. This is a more fragile approach:

=== Breaks Browser User Features ===
As illustrated by: https://twitter.com/gabrielgironda/status/721115498474270721 <blockquote>DEAR #FRONTEND DEVELOPERS: PLEASE STOP MAKING SITES WITH LINKS I CAN'T COMMAND-CLICK TO OPEN IN A NEW TAB. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU </blockquote>

=== Can Encourage Bad Engineering ===
As summarized by: https://twitter.com/fox/status/716879915333750784 <blockquote>I have seen the worst engineering in my career lately and I have one message: <br/><br/>STOP TRYING TO WRITE EVERYTHING FRONT-END IN JAVASCRIPT</blockquote>
