'''<dfn>Jitsi Meet</dfn>''' is a free open-source self-hostable video conferencing solution that was occasionally used for virtual [[HWC]]s and [[IWC]]s.

== Features ==
* It supports essentially unlimited rooms by postfixing a room name to the end of the url similar to [[Google Hangouts]]. For example, using the Jitsi Meet service you can enter: https://meet.jit.si/{room name}
* Supports WebRTC but does not seem to be peer to peer (this needs to be verified with testing)
* Supports audio-only mode for guests as well as push-to-talk mode.
* Supports streaming to YouTube Live
* Has clients on: Web, iOS, Android, as well as desktop Electron apps.
* Connect to a shared Etherpad document among everyone in the conference
* Screen-sharing
* No accounts needed

== Criticism ==
* Since all video connections are peer-to-peer, some participants may not be able to see or hear others depending on network conditions.
* Once more than 3-4 people join a call, since it's entirely peer to peer, all video streams are streamed to everyone else, and requires a lot of bandwidth and CPU.
