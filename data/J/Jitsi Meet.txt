'''<dfn>Jitsi Meet</dfn>''' is a free open-source self-hostable video conferencing solution that was occasionally used for virtual [[HWC]]s and [[IWC]]s.

== Features ==
* It supports essentially unlimited rooms by postfixing a room name to the end of the url similar to [[Google Hangouts]]. For example, using the Jitsi Meet service you can enter: https://meet.jit.si/{room name}
* Uses WebRTC, but *not* P2P for >2 participants - decreased bandwidth requirements for clients, less issues with P2P discovery
* Supports audio-only mode for guests as well as push-to-talk mode.
* Supports streaming to YouTube Live
* Has clients on: Web, iOS, Android, as well as desktop Electron apps.
* Connect to a shared Etherpad document among everyone in the conference
* Screen-sharing 
* No accounts needed
* [https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/ Open-Source]

== Issues ==
* occasional reliability issues (dropped connections not being cleaned up)
* problems with Firefox, other browsers work better. Currently (2020-05) waiting on improvements to Firefox by Mozilla, see https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/4758
* {{jamietanna}}, as an organiser of https://phpminds.org, ran through Jitsi from April->September, but due to continued stability issues of the platform, and issues with non-Chrome browsers (even after the above improvements were released) we moved to Zoom, due to our license being provided through sponsorship
