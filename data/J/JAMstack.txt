'''<dfn>[https://jamstack.org/ JAMstack]</dfn>''' is a web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

According to the community website:
<blockquote>
Your project is built with the JAMstack if it meets three key criteria:
# Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript.
#. All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTP with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.
# Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.
</blockquote>

While this appears to encourage site designs that are [[js;dr]], it is possible that a [[static site]] which is built by a [[static site generator]] that supports updates through APIs like [[micropub]] and [[webmention]] would be considered "built with the JAMstack".
