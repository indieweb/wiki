== IndieWeb Extension ==
Known adds a <code>_indieweb</code> extension to the items in the JSON feed. This includes keys like:

* <code>type</code>: a string for [[post_type#Kinds_of_Posts|kinds of posts]],
* <code>in-reply-to</code>,
* â€¦

[[Koype]] uses the same <code>_indieweb</code> extension to expose the following on each post:

* <code>type</code>: a string representing the [[post_type#Kinds_of_Posts|kinds of posts]]
* <code>syndication</code>: a list of [[syndication|syndicated copies]] of this entry.

And under <code>_koype</code> extension on the main feed:

* <code>version</code>: The version of Koype used to serve this feed.
* <code>about</code>: A link to Koype's main homepage (not the site's homepage).
