'''<dfn>[http://joomla.org Joomla]</dfn>''' is a [[content management system]] that can be IndieWebified.

== How to ==
See Astrid Günther’s 2022-11-12 article <cite>[https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/ IndieWeb]</cite> for how to IndieWebify a Joomla site, including setting up and supporring features like:
* [[Web Sign-in]]
* [[h-card]]
* [[h-entry]]
* [[u-in-reply-to]]
* receiving [[webmention]]s and [[pingback]]s via [[webmention.io]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None known at this time.

== Criticism ==
* I have worked with several Joomla installations over the years (all in 1.x and 1.5.x versions) and found it to be a pain in the neck. The terminology and structure of the code in its MVC is confusing and relatively simple tasks have taken longer than necessary. I have dealt with several security problems and hacked installations — including a site that was being used as part of a botnet. Perhaps the core code is no less secure than other CMS (bugs happen), but I feel like there's a disproportionate amount of headaches for Joomla, perhaps because it encourages poor server practices. I won't pretend to be unbiased, here. I loathe Joomla and strongly recommend not using it. {{gRegor}}
