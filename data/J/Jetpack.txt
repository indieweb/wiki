'''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/ Jetpack]</dfn>''' is an opensource [[WordPress]] plugin that adds many site management tools including visitor stats, security services, performance improvements, and [[syndication]] options. Jetpack functionality is pre-built into [[WordPress.com]] hosted websites.

The development version of the plugin can be found on [https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/ Github].

== Features ==
=== POSSE using Jetpack Publicize ===
[[File:wordpress_com_publicize.png|thumb|left]] 

Jetpack includes a [https://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/ Publicize function] which one can use to [[POSSE]] to a variety of silos ([[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Path]]) with minimal configuration required. It also has excessive and clear documentation.

Its dashboard can be found at http://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=sharing by replacing example.com with your personal domain name.

== Issues ==

Jetpack will stick in open graph material in your header that you may not want.

The JetPack share buttons are not compliant with IndieWeb themes as they add the social share buttons inside of the p-content. This creates display issues in social readers.

** "I won't be using Jetpack; too little control. Even if I ever wanted to publish every post of mine, I'd want to treat notes differently. And if I kept note of what I posted where, I could maybe poll for responses without a 3rd-party serviceâ€”without a link back, even." [https://janboddez.tech @janboddez] January 3, 2019
