'''<dfn>[https://jottit.pub Jottit]</dfn>''' is an open source [[static site generator]] built in [[Python]], originally made in 2007 by Simon Carstensen and Aaron Swartz, rebuilt and relaunched in 2025.

* Open source: https://github.com/Jottit/jottit

The idea: make publishing so effortless that you just do it without thinking.

Every site is a [[Git]] repository. You own your data completely - clone it, move it, do whatever you want with it.
