Jottit is a tool for radically simple web publishing, originally built in 2007 by Simon Carstensen and Aaron Swartz. It was rebuilt and relaunched in 2025.

The idea: make publishing so effortless that you just do it without thinking.

Every site is a Git repository. You own your data completely - clone it, move it, do whatever you want with it.
