'''<dfn>JanusXR</dfn>''' was an ostensibly-decentralized, self-hosted, but apparently proprietary social VR platform. See https://janusxr.org/.

However, the company appears to have ceased operations and it is no longer possible to obtain the client or creation tools, making it actually an example of [[silo death]].
