{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://json.org/ JSON]</dfn>''' (abbreviation for <dfn>[[JavaScript]] Object Notation</dfn>) is a data serialization format often used by HTTP APIs, growing in popularity instead of XML, and also the canonical output of [[microformats2]] parsers. 

== Specs ==
There have been many descriptions of the JSON format. ECMA-404 includes some of this history, quoted here with links added:

<blockquote>JSON was first presented to the world at the JSON.org website in 2001. A definition of the JSON syntax was subsequently published as IETF [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627 RFC 4627] in July 2006. [https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm ECMA-262], Fifth Edition (2009) included a normative specification of the JSON grammar. This specification, [https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm ECMA-404], replaces those earlier definitions of the JSON syntax. Concurrently, the IETF published [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7158 RFC 7158]/[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159 7159] and in 2017 [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259 RFC 8259] as updates to RFC 4627. The JSON syntax specified by this specification and by RFC 8259 are intended to be identical.</blockquote>

It must be noted that [https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Tim Tim Bray], editor of RFC 8259, actually recommends using I-JSON ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7493 RFC 7493]) and none of the above mentioned specifications. Because it “ex­plic­it­ly rules out some legal-but-dumbass things”. ({{citation

== HTML first gives you automatic JSON ==
You should always support a human readable HTML page of any data you publish, and mark it up with microformats2. At that point you don't need a separate JSON representation, because microformats2 parsers give you back canonical JSON which you can then serve if you wish, e.g. see [[JSON#Aaron_Parecki|Aaron Parecki's example below]].

== Issues ==

=== Accepting JSON POST requests ===
{{main|JSON form encoded}}

JSON does not have as wide support for POST requests compared to [[form-encoded]] requests. 

In most web frameworks you have to jump through hoops to read the raw POST data if it's JSON format.

A Google search can confirm that lots of people are confused about how to handle JSON POST requests: [http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+receive+JSON+post+in+(php%7Cruby%7Cpython%7Cnode) how to receive JSON post in php, ruby, python, node]

== Indieweb Examples ==

=== Barnaby Walters ===
Previously, [[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] using [[Taproot]] on waterpigs.co.uk would return a JSON version of a document by appending ".json" to the URL. However, in 2014-?? Barnaby dropped support for this.

<blockquote>"I ditched content negotiation because it turned out to be a huge maintentance chore of very little actual value. ...the .json view was essentially the same as the parsed microformat view, and I never used it so it kept breaking"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-17/line/1400359793]</blockquote>

=== Aaron Parecki ===
Previously, [[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] returned JSON representations of URLs by appending ".json". However, in 2016-01 when Aaron launched the new version of his website, the new site did not support this feature.
<blockquote>"My .json view is *literally* the parsed microformat view. As in, I render the HTML as normal, then pass it through mf2-php before responding. It's like getting content negotiation for free."[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-17/line/1400359912]</blockquote>
