{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Add to Calendar</dfn>''' is a common button or menu option shown on [[event]] user interfaces that a user can click to add the event to their calendaring program; consider putting an "âœšðŸ—“ Add to Calendar" button your indie [[event]] posts as an easy way for your readers to keep track of your event in their calendar.

=== How to publish ICS ===
(section stub)

As part of implementing an "Add to Calendar" link that provides ICS, you have to generate (or use a service to generate) a valid and compatible ICS file.

Generating ICS is non-trivial. There are many non-obvious gotchas.

For example, Apple Calendar on MacOS will ONLY handle datetimes (DTSTART or DTEND) that:
* '''T separator''': use a "T" separator between date and time (no " " allowed)
* '''explicit seconds''': must provide explicit seconds with the time, i.e. requiring artificial 00 seconds precision be added if your published datetime lacks it
* '''no tz offset''', e.g. only these two options work:
*# Z time: <code>20181005T174800Z</code> or 
*# floating time: <code>20150120T190000</code>

Even though it (currently) requires classic [[hCalendar]] markup, you may want to consider using this to generate your ICS for you:

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has an "Add to Calendar" link at the bottom of event posts since 2017-07-27 [https://gregorlove.com/2017/08/owning-my-calendar/]
* Example: https://gregorlove.com/2018/10/virtual-homebrew-website-club/
* Currently the [https://emojipedia.org/calendar/ calendar] emoji is part of the link, though I might consider removing that since it shows "July 17" in a lot of environments, which can be confusing.
