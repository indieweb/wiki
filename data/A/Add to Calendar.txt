'''<dfn>Add to Calendar</dfn>''' is a common button or menu option shown on [[event]] user interfaces that a user can click to add the event to their calendaring program; consider putting an "âœšðŸ—“ Add to Calendar" button your indie [[event]] posts as an easy way for your readers to keep track of your event in their calendar.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has an "Add to Calendar" link at the bottom of event posts since 2017-07-27 [https://gregorlove.com/2017/08/owning-my-calendar/]
* Example: https://gregorlove.com/2018/10/virtual-homebrew-website-club/
* Currently the [https://emojipedia.org/calendar/ calendar] emoji is part of the link, though I might consider removing that since it shows "July 17" in a lot of environments, which can be confusing.
