{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Add to Calendar</dfn>''' is a common button or menu option shown on [[event]] user interfaces  to add the event to a calendaring program; consider putting an "âœšðŸ—“ Add to Calendar" button your indie [[event]] posts as a convenient way for readers to remind themselves about your event.

"Add to Calendar" is in broader terms a [[webaction]] that can be used to copy an event from a web page across to another page or application.

== How to ==
=== How to publish ICS ===
As part of implementing an "Add to Calendar" link that provides ICS, you have to generate (or use a service to generate) a valid and compatible ICS file.

Generating ICS is non-trivial. There are many non-obvious gotchas.

For example, Apple Calendar on MacOS will ONLY handle datetimes (DTSTART or DTEND) that:
* '''T separator''': use a "T" separator between date and time (no " " allowed)
* '''explicit seconds''': must provide explicit seconds with the time, i.e. requiring artificial 00 seconds precision be added if your published datetime lacks it
* '''no tz offset''', e.g. only these two options work:
*# Z time: <code>20181005T174800Z</code> or 
*# floating time: <code>20150120T190000</code>

Even though it (currently) requires classic [[hCalendar]] markup, you may want to consider using this to generate your ICS for you:
* [[h2vx]] event conversion service
** https://h2vx.com/ics

=== How to make Add to Calendar ===
An Add to Calendar link has two essential pieces:
# <code>href</code> â€” this should be the URL to your ICS that you figured out in [[#How_to_publish_ICS]]
# link text â€” consider using something like: <blockquote>ðŸ“† Add to Calendar</blockquote>

If youâ€™re using [[H2VX]] to generate your ICS, you may link from your event page to <nowiki>https://h2vx.com/ics/referrer</nowiki>, to tell H2VX to automatically get the URL of your page from the HTTP referer headers.

'''Optional:''' â€” the following two attributes are proper semantic HTML, however it is not clear if there is anything that does anything with them:
* <code>rel="alternate"</code>
* <code>type="text/calendar"</code>
Theoretically a calendar app or service (aggregator), could do auto-discovery on your event page to find the ICS by looking for a link with these two attributes (similar to how RSS aggregators do auto-discovery on blogs by looking for a link with rel=alternate and a content type for a [[feed file]]).

Complete example:
<pre>
<a href="https://h2vx.com/ics/https://indieweb.org/events"
   rel="alternate"
   type="text/calendar">ðŸ“† Add IndieWeb Events to Calendar</a>
</pre>

Will show: <blockquote><a href="https://h2vx.com/ics/https://indieweb.org/events" type="text/calendar">ðŸ“† Add IndieWeb Events to Calendar</a></blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Jeena ===
{{main|event#Jeena}}
{{jeena}} in 2015 implemented a "download ics" grey italics .ics link as part of the header on his events, e.g.:
* https://jeena.net/events/2

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} implements "Add to Calendar" with links just after the header on [[event]] posts on his site since 2017-07-13, including options for [[ICS]] and [[Google Calendar]].
* ðŸ“† Add to Calendar: iCal | Google Calendar

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has an "Add to Calendar" link at the bottom of event posts since 2017-07-27 [https://gregorlove.com/2017/08/owning-my-calendar/]
* Example: https://gregorlove.com/2018/10/virtual-homebrew-website-club/
* Currently the [https://emojipedia.org/calendar/ calendar] emoji is part of the link, though I might consider removing that since it shows "July 17" in a lot of environments, which can be confusing.

=== IndieWeb Summit ===
Starting with [[2019]], the main [[2019|IndieWeb Summit wiki page]] has an Add to Calendar link just after the brief definition/summary at the top, right before event details like dates, venue, tickets.
* âœšðŸ—“ Add to Calendar

=== add yourself! ===

== Silo Examples ==
=== meetup.com ===
[[File:meetup.com-add-to-calendar-2019-04-01.png|300px|alt=screenshot of add to calendar UI]]

"Add to Calendar" link appears under the date and time. Clicking it pops up options for [[Google Calendar]], [[iCal]], Outlook, and Yahoo Calendar.
