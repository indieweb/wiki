[https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/ Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager] (abbreviated ACM) is a service for managing and deploying Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) certificates, primarily for use with Amazon services like [[Cloudfront]]. TLS/SSL certificates are [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-certificate-manager-deploy-ssltls-based-apps-on-aws/ provided for free through ACM].

A common method for deploying a [[HTTPS]]-enabled [[static site]] would be to host it on Amazon S3, deploy to a CloudFront distribution, and then use ACM to provision a certificate for free. CloudFront is required for hosting a static site that is configured and deployed with an ACM-provisioned certificate.
