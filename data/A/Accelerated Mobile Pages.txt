{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml Accelerated Mobile Pages]</dfn>''' ('''AMP''') is a [[Google]]-led project that (often) speeds up a subset of HTML through caching and dependencies on Google infrastructure.

== IndieWeb Support ==
The pull request https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/499 by {{aaronpk}} adds [[h-entry]] support to AMP example(s) and thus makes AMP more IndieWeb [[friendly]] by default

The PR was subsequently closed with the comment "We decided to remove metadata requirements from AMP." See: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/593

}}: <blockquote>Given the higher page RPMs and subscriber conversion rates of a non-AMP page, pulling the plug on AMP looks like an easy win for both programmatic and consumer revenue. And most importantly, we regain full control of the user experience. And that’s perhaps the biggest upside.</blockquote>

== Issues ==
=== XML like fragility ===
It appears that initial implementation(s) of AMP HTML consuming code treat it similarly to old XML consuming code, which is to fail in a fragile way, e.g. as noted in https://twitter.com/bryanrieger/status/651782717676216320

* Alternative: For anyone not wanting to use AMP, reader mode in firefox is pretty cool, as are lightweight pages
* Criticism: “I’ve long described Google as an incredibly curious and intelligent five-year-old with no concept of consequences or history. Right now they are seeming also like they’ve found an original historically-significant manuscript, torn a page out of it, scribbled all over it in crayon, and called it their own original story. And people are rushing to put it on their refrigerators.”
