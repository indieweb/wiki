'''<dfn>[https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml Accelerated Mobile Pages]</dfn>''' ('''AMP''') is a [[Google]]-led project that (often) speeds up a subset of HTML through caching and dependencies on Google infrastructure.

== IndieWeb Support ==
The pull request https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/499 by {{aaronpk}} adds [[h-entry]] support to AMP example(s) and thus makes AMP more IndieWeb [[friendly]] by default

The PR was subsequently closed with the comment "We decided to remove metadata requirements from AMP." See: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/593

== Issues ==
=== XML like fragility ===
It appears that initial implementation(s) of AMP HTML consuming code treat it similarly to old XML consuming code, which is to fail in a fragile way, e.g. as noted in https://twitter.com/bryanrieger/status/651782717676216320
