{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Accelerated Mobile Pages</dfn>''' ('''AMP''') is a [[Google]]-led project that speeds up a subset of HTML through caching and dependencies on google: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml

== IndieWeb Support ==
The pull request https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/499 by {{aaronpk}} adds [[h-entry]] support to AMP example(s) and thus makes AMP more IndieWeb [[friendly]] by default

The PR was subsequently closed with the comment "We decided to remove metadata requirements from AMP." See: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/593

== Issues ==
=== XML like fragility ===
It appears that initial implementation(s) of AMP HTML consuming code treat it similarly to old XML consuming code, which is to fail in a fragile way, e.g. as noted in https://twitter.com/bryanrieger/status/651782717676216320

** "lol, amp. i noticed that a page would suddenly appear after 8 seconds of waiting if i disabled js, which seemed pretty weird.<br>turns out that there's a css3 anim to hide the page for 8 full seconds (that is skipped when the js loads ofc). this is *required* by the amp standard.<br>your page fails validation if you don't do this.sure makes these goog results look kinda suspicious, huh" [https://icosahedron.website/@Xkeeper @🌺 Revya Centauros 🌸] August 5, 2018
