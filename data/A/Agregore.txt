'''<dfn>[https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/agregore-browser Agregore]</dfn>''' is a minimal web browser that supports distributed web protocols such as [[IPFS]] and [[Dat]] (now Hyper) in addition to standard web content.

Agregore is developer-focused, to enable the development of local-first and decentralized apps using web technology. It can be extended via [[WebExtensions]] to add new features, protocol support, and more.

It aims to support linking, embedding, and sharing of content over distributed protocols like <code>hyper://</code>, <code>ipfs://</code> and <code>ipns://</code>. This is often accomplished with wrapper libraries that translate JavaScript <code>fetch</code> requests into protocol-specific actions. For example, [js-ipfs-fetch](https://github.com/RangerMauve/js-ipfs-fetch) allows fetching content from and posting content to IPFS.
