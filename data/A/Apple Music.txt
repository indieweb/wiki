'''<dfn>Apple Music</dfn>''' is a paid music subscription service from [[Apple]] that offers a free three-month trial and then after the free trial requires you to pay to access Apple Music files again.

== Negative Experience ==

Some people have had Apple Music delete all their local music files after uploading them to Apple's servers after signing-up and then lost all of their music after they ended the free trial.

** "unless you tell it to" is a poor apologism. Software should NEVER encourage/enable data-loss, which is what Apple's iTunes (mis)match does when combined with deleting local copies. - {{t}}

== Positive Experience ==

{{veganstraightedge}}: I did the 3 month free trial, then canceled. I suffered no data loss. I later signed up for the service, quit it and restarted it. And still not suffered any data loss. I have my music on my laptop/phone and their music (I've not paid for it) is only cached from Apple Music on my devices (but not accessible in iTunes' normal filesystem). The user experience in iTunes is very not great, but my experience has been good, with regards to data.
