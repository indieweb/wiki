'''<dfn>[https://github.com/reiterate-app/authorio Authorio]</dfn>''' is a Rails engine / Ruby gem that enables authentication endpoint functionality.

If you are looking for a minimal, self-hostable [[authorization-endpoint]], see [[selfauth]].

== Why ==

* If you already have your own server running on the Rails framework, Authorio is a simple way to join [[IndieAuth]].
* You can use your established web site URL as your identity.
* You don't need [[silo]] accounts to use Authorio. You can eliminate all dependencies on Twitter or GitHub and enjoy a 100% federated identity.
* All your data is contained on a server you control.

== How-to ==

This is a condensed version of the [https://github.com/reiterate-app/authorio/blob/master/README.md Installation instructions] in the README

# Add the gem to your Gemfile <code>gem install authorio</code> and install it <code>bundle</code>
# Install the Authorio config files: <code>rails generate authorio:install</code>
# Install and perform the database migrations
## <code>rails authorio:install:migrations</code>
## <code>rails db:migrate</code>
# Add <code>authorio_routes</code> to your <code>routes.rb</code>
# Add <code><%= indieauth_tag %></code> to your home page
# Set your initial password: <code>rails authorio:password</code>
# Add Authorio's assets to your asset pipeline: <code>rails assets:precompile</code>
# Restart your site

Setup complete! You should now be able to use your site's URL to log in to an IndieAuth client.

== Alternatives ==

Authorio can be an excellent solution if you already have your own Rails-based server set up. But it might not be the best solution for you.

* If you don't want to set up and manage your own web server, you're better off using rel=me and [[RelMeAuth]] to manage your identity.
* If you have a server, but it's not built on the Rails framework, then Authenio is not for you. There are plugins for other frameworks, such as the [[WordPress_IndieAuth_Plugin|WordPress Plugin]] for WordPress sites.
* If you want to run your own authentication endpoint but you don't have a server yet, you might be better with an all-in-one server + IndieAuth solution like [[selfauth]] or [https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence Acquiescence]
