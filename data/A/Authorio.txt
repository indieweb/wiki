{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://github.com/reiterate-app/authorio Authorio]</dfn>''' is a Rails engine / Ruby gem that enables authentication endpoint functionality.

If you are looking for a minimal, self-hostable [[authentication-endpoint]], see [[selfauth]].

== Why ==

* You don't need [[silo]] accounts to use Authorio, so it's [[IndieAuth]] without Twitter or Github.
* More privacy: you don't tell silos that you want to login somewhere, only your own server.
* Not vulnerable for social engineering with silo accounts.
* If you already have your own server running on the Rails framework, Authorio is a simple way to join [[IndieAuth]].

== How-to ==

# Install the gem from RubyGems <code>gem install authorio</code>
# Follow the steps in the [https://github.com/reiterate-app/authorio/blob/master/README.md README file]
# If your site is running the latest Rails (version 6 at least), it should only take a few minutes to set up and configure Authorio.
# Reboot your site, and then you can use your URL to log in to any IndieAuth client.

== Criticism ==

* It's easier to use rel=me and re-use your existing accounts.
* This is only useful if you already have a Rails website running.
