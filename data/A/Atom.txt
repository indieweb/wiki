'''<dfn>[https://indieweb.org/site-deaths#atomenabled.org Atom]</dfn>''' is an XML format and protocol for publishing [[feeds]] that was developed as a more formally specified alternative to [[RSS]]. Not to be confused with the open-source text editor [[Atom.io]] from GitHub.

'''[[h-entry]]''' and '''[[h-feed]]''' are [[microformats2]] vocabularies based on Atom, which supersede the classic [[hAtom]] microformat.

Atom is defined in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023 RFC 5023] (format) and [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287 RFC 4287] (protocol). atomenabled.org was the canonical web site, [[site-deaths#atomenabled.org|but it died]].

=== Sandeep Shetty ===
'''sandeep.io''' generates an Atom feed from [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed h-feed] (using an h-feed to atom proxy). See [http://www.sandeep.io/98 DRY: h-feed enabled = Atom enabled] -[[User:Www.sandeep.io|Www.sandeep.io]] 14:06, 30 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} generates (using [[Falcon]]) a minimal subset Atom+ActivityStreams feed on tantek.com from storage. Due to bandwidth inefficiency of XML formats (and apparent bandwidth abuse of XML consuming code/servers), his Atom [[feed file]] only has the most recent 1 item(s), whereas his [[h-feed]] on his home page has the latest 64 items (as of 2015-265). See also [[feed_file#Criticism|feed file: Criticism]] and in particular [[feed#Criticism|feed: Criticism]].

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby]] publishes auto-discoverable ATOM feeds on all feed pages using [[Taproot]] on [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] e.g. [https://waterpigs.co.uk/services/microformats-to-atom/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwaterpigs.co.uk%2F the homepage] since ????-??-??.
* The feeds are automatically generated from the h-entry microformats on the page, so I only have to maintain the HTML which works for humans and machines rather than two copies. The endpoint I use for converting is open for anyone to use: [https://waterpigs.co.uk/services/microformats-to-atom/ microformats to ATOM] --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 10:17, 10 February 2015 (PST)

=== Christian Weiske ===
{{cweiske}}'s blog natively generates full-text atom feeds for tag-filtered and all posts

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} publishes an Atom feed for all post feeds (most recent iteration since 2014-09-13).
* add ?feed=atom to any regular feed for an Atom version. e.g.,
** https://kylewm.com/?feed=atom
** https://kylewm.com/photos?feed=atom
** https://kylewm.com/tags/indieweb?feed=atom
* Entries includes simple reply/repost context

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} publishes an Atom feed for articles as of 2015-02-11
* http://gregorlove.com/articles.atom
* Previously I was publishing an RSS 2.0 feed that was delivered by [[FeedBurner]]. I migrated back to a self-hosted feed due to the unsure future of FeedBurner, plus having more control of the feed since it is on my own domain again.

As of 2016-03-08, I'm experimenting with [[Granary]] to convert my notes [[h-feed]] into an Atom feed.
* http://gregorlove.com/notes.atom

== Projects ==
=== granary ===
{{snarfed}}'s [https://github.com/snarfed/granary granary] fetches and converts [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and [[Google+]] data to and from Atom, as well as other formats like [[ActivityStreams]] and [[microformats2]] HTML/JSON.

=== hfeed2atom ===
[https://github.com/kartikprabhu/hfeed2atom hfeed2atom] converts h-feeds to atom feeds.

=== Unmung ===
{{main|unmung}}
* [[unmung]] generates an h-feed from any Atom or RSS one

== Autodiscovery ==
Atom feeds can be automatically discovered by feed readers if the homepage contains a link to it in its <tt><head></tt> tag:

 <link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Feed" href="atomfeed.xml" />

The title is important if there are multiple feeds linked, e.g. category and comment feeds.

== Comments ==

The [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4685 Atom Threading Extensions RFC 4685] extends the Atom XML format to allow direct embedding of comments for posts/entries in the atom feed, as well as linking to comment feed files for single posts.

=== RSS Atom wars ===
{{main|RSS Atom wars}}
From 2003-2007 (at least) there was significant energy put into debating the merits of using [[Atom]] vs [[RSS]]. This quite heated ongoing debate earned the name of "<dfn>RSS Atom Wars</dfn>" or "<dfn>syndication wars</dfn>".

See: [[RSS Atom wars]] for citations and quotes from articles during this time period that illustrate the tensions and conflicts.
