'''<dfn>Amazon Simple Queue Service</dfn>''', or SQS, is a hosted [[message queue]] for sending messages between distributed components of a web application. It is a service under the [[AWS]] umbrella with a generous free tier.

== Criticism ==

SQS is probably overkill and/or not useful for most self-hosted IndieWeb applications. At first glance, it appears helpful in running asynchronous jobs on a [[shared host]]. But unfortunately you must periodically ''poll'' the endpoint for new jobs, rather than having jobs sent to you through eg. a [[webhook]], so you would still need to have a continuously running process to monitor SQS and that's what can be hard on a classic [[shared host]].
