{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Ask If Safe</dfn>''' is a button next to a person listed in a [[safety check]] that may have been in the area of a disaster, but has not yet marked themselves as safe.

Since this button likely generates a private post to the person being asked, and thus could occur cross-site, it seems like a [[webaction]].

== Past IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{martijnvdven}} added a dedicated page for his [[safety status]] at <nowiki>http://vanderven.se/martijn/safe/</nowiki>. The page included a button to request an update. This came out of [https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-12-19#t1482185122481000 a discussion on IRC]. This page has since been removed as it saw no real use.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] in particular has ( Ask If Safe ) buttons next to people in their [[safety check]] features.

Upon receiving such a request, the recipient may have multiple options, e.g.: (not sure of exact button / UI wording)
* mark themselves safe
* declare themselves out of the area
* ...

(SCREENSHOT NEEDED)

When one of these is pressed/selected, it generates a [[safety status]] post.
