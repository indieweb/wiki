{{benthatmustbeme}} posts to his site ben.thatmustbe.me using his Android device with a mobile web app that allows for [[micropub]] posting via [[MobilePub]]. The URL for the app can be logged into at [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/mobilepub/ https://ben.thatmustbe.me/mobilepub/]

=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} wants to post to his site using his Android device with a native Android app for Micropub, but none exists. As a compromise, he is using [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts&hl=en HTTP Shortcuts] which is a surprisingly customizable way to do GET/POST on Android, with configurable variables, sharing, dialog boxes, etc. It's a bit cumbersome to set up, but it can take the place of a Micropub app. He has created a simple API to do this.
