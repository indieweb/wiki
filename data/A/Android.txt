=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} posts to his site ben.thatmustbe.me using his Android device with a mobile web app that allows for [[micropub]] posting via [[MobilePub]]. The URL for the app can be logged into at [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/mobilepub/ https://ben.thatmustbe.me/mobilepub/]

=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} wants to post to his site using his Android device with a native Android app for Micropub, but none exists. As a compromise, he is using [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts&hl=en HTTP Shortcuts] which is a surprisingly customizable way to do GET/POST on Android, with configurable variables, sharing, dialog boxes, etc. It's a bit cumbersome to set up, but it can take the place of a Micropub app. He has created a simple API to do this.

=== Xavier malware ===
* 2017-06-16 [https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/xavier-andoid-malware/  Newly discovered Android malware Xavier clandestinely steals your data] <blockquote>…a Trojan dubbed Xavier, which is embedded in more than 800 applications on Android’s app store, clandestinely steals and leaks personal data…</blockquote>

=== Forced Location Tracking ===
2017-11-12 [https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/ Google collects Android users’ locations even when location services are disabled] <blockquote>Since the beginning of 2017, Android phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby cellular towers—even when location services are disabled—and sending that data back to Google.</blockquote>

2018-01-24 [https://qz.com/1169760/phone-data/ Google can still use Bluetooth to track your Android phone when Bluetooth is turned off] <blockquote>A Quartz investigation found that a user can turn Bluetooth off on their smartphone running Google’s Android software, and the phone will continue to use Bluetooth to collect location-related data and transmit that data to Google.</blockquote>

And perhaps not completely forced, but certainly heavily pressured (many apps request Location History and make it seem like they won't function otherwise - or maybe they actually won't!)

2018-01-24 [https://qz.com/1183559/if-youre-using-an-android-phone-google-may-be-tracking-every-move-you-make/ If you’re using an Android phone, Google may be tracking every move you make] <blockquote>phones using Android begin silently transmitting data back to the servers of Google, including everything from GPS coordinates to nearby wifi networks, barometric pressure, and even a guess at the phone-holder’s current activity [...] activating Location History is subtly baked into setup for apps like Google Maps, Photos, the Google Assistant, and the primary Google app.</blockquote>
