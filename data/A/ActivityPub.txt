=== ActivityPub Notifications to Webmention ===

Since Mastodon and other ActivityPub implementations often include Microformats on their permalinks, a shortcut for receiving comments from ActivityPub servers is to treat them as webmentions instead of doing the full Inbox processing normally required by ActivityPub.

When your ActivityPub inbox receives a notification:

* If <code>type</code> is <code>Create</code>
** and if <code>object.InReplyTo</code> is present and is a URL on your domain
*** then save <code>object.id</code> as "source"
*** save <code>object.InReplyTo</code> as "target"
*** send a webmention to your webmention endpoint with the source and target

Then your site's existing webmention handling will fetch and verify the ActivityPub source URL, and if there are Microformats on the page, will even look like a reply.

Example:
* Post permalink: https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/01/9/
* Mastodon reply URL: https://mastodon.social/@aaronpk/100302258872089825
