'''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/ ActivityPub]</dfn>''' is a decentralized social networking protocol ([[W3C]] Recommendation) developed in the [[Social Web Working Group]] based on [[pump.io]] and [[ActivityStreams]]. Conceptually they were all preceded by [[OStatus]]. It was  briefly known as <dfn>ActivityPump</dfn> before being renamed to ActivityPub.

__TOC__

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Matthias Pfefferle  ===
{{pfefferle}} has built the [[WordPress]] [https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/ ActivityPub] and [https://wordpress.org/plugins/nodeinfo/ NodeInfo plugin]s which allows his WordPress sites to (at least partially) support the ActivityPub protocol so sites like [[Mastodon]] and other parts of the Fediverse view his sites as a federated member. Other sites using this method can be seen at https://the-federation.info/wordpress.
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} added initial support for [[ActivityPub]] to his website around 2018-07-04 in order to be able to receive likes & comments, reply to Mastodon users, and so that it can be followed from people using compatible software

As of 2018-07-23, {{aaronpk}} has about 64 followers from various ActivityPub profiles, and has a few posts that have received a mix of replies from Mastodon and other ActivityPub users.

Nautilus:
* turned knowledge of implementing ActivityPub into a separate service that can be used to add ActivityPub to any website, the code is available as [https://github.com/aaronpk/Nautilus Nautilus] on GitHub.

=== Greg McVerry ===
{{jgmac1106}} uses:
* native ActivityPub support in [[Micro.blog]] which can be viewed @jgmac1106@stream.jgregorymcverry.com he can then send posts from his blog to his ActivityPub instance through [[Micro.blog]]

Previously used (quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com unresponsive as of 2023-05-25):
* Mastodon Plugin for [[Known]] which enables syndication:
** Added the Mastodon Plugin for [[Known]] to syndicate posts but also used [[Bridgy]] to create an instance of his blog at  @quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com@quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com.

=== Jan-Lukas Else ===
{{jlelse}} uses [[GoBlog]], which has native ActivityPub support.

=== Hammy Havoc ===
{{hammyhavoc}} added ActivityPub support on the [https://hammyhavoc.com Hammy Havoc blog] on 2023-01-01 via the ActivityPub WordPress plugin.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} uses [[Bridgy Fed]] to backfeed ActivityPub interactions from Mastodon etc to his site, eg the [https://snarfed.org/2019-10-22_mastodon-on-bridgy#comments interactions on this page] and [https://snarfed.org/about the followers list at the bottom of this page].

=== Lots more Bridgy Fed users ===
{{main|Bridgy_Fed#IndieWeb_Examples}}
Since 2019, many more folks have added ActivityPub support to their personal sites via Bridgy Fed.

== Bridging ==

{{main|bridge#ActivityPub}}

=== Bridgy Fed ===

[[Bridgy Fed]] is a comprehensive service that translates ActivityPub feeds and interactions to/from IndieWeb sites and protocols.

=== ActivityPub Notifications to Webmention ===

Since Mastodon and other ActivityPub implementations often include Microformats on their permalinks, a shortcut for receiving comments from ActivityPub servers is to treat them as webmentions instead of doing the full Inbox processing normally required by ActivityPub.

When your ActivityPub inbox receives a notification:

* If <code>type</code> is <code>Create</code>
** and if <code>object.InReplyTo</code> is present and is a URL on your domain
*** then save <code>object.id</code> as "source"
*** save <code>object.InReplyTo</code> as "target"
*** send a webmention to your webmention endpoint with the source and target

Then your site's existing webmention handling will fetch and verify the ActivityPub source URL, and if there are Microformats on the page, will even look like a reply.

Example:
* Post permalink: https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/01/9/
* Mastodon reply URL: https://mastodon.social/@aaronpk/100302258872089825

=== Sending an ActivityPub notification from an IndieWeb website ===

As more people and services in the IndieWeb build in support for ActivityPub, it's important to remember that competing communication options could happen. Here is a general top-level breakdown of sending an ActivityPub notification for a [[reply]] or [[like]].

The u-in-reply-to or u-like-of url will be referred to as the "targetUrl" below, and your post is referred to as the sourceUrl.

* Fetch the targetUrl via text/html, check for a [[webmention]] endpoint.
* If webmention endpoint exists, abort ActivityPub and send a [[webmention]] for sourceUrl to targetUrl
* If webmention endpoint does not exist, attempt to fetch the targetUrl as <code>application/activity+json</code>
** If targetUrl doesn't return JSON, targetUrl doesn't accept ActivityPub, abort.
** If targetUrl returns JSON, check for a top-level <code>@context</code> attribute. This can be an array or a string, check if it contains "<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams</code>".
*** If targetUrl's JSON response does not return the right details, abort.
*** If targetUrl's JSON response returns the correct info, check the <code>attributedTo</code> attribute for the author's ActivityPub profile.
**** Fetch the author's ActivityPub profile url as <code>application/activity+json</code> and check top-level <code>inbox</code> attribute for the author's ActivityPub inbox endpoint.
**** Send an ActivityPub notification to the author's ActivityPub inbox endpoint.

==== Tips & Tricks for Sending ActivityPub notifications ====
* Mastodon requires that you include a "Mention" in the tags array, but you also need to include the person's <code>preferredUsername</code> in the post text to show it as a notification.
* Technically <code>attributedTo</code> can be an object, but this hasn't been seen in the wild yet.

* 2018-07-30 [http://beesbuzz.biz/blog/2535-ActivityPub-hot-take ActivityPub hot take] <blockquote>This isn’t creating a distributed network, this is creating a whole bunch of massive points of failure. And these failures grow exponentially as more failures happen. Its very nature also makes it so that it’s much more difficult for this data to be migrated; look at what happened when [[witches.town]] went down, or when scifi.fyi’s certificate expired [Ed.: for ~ a day https://scifi.fyi/@BrokenBiscuit/100426278316164570], and the effects this had on all other instances regardless of the users of those instances. And spinning up an instance is expensive, and that cost rises with the number of instances out there.</blockquote>

** "@manton I gave up on even consuming ActivityPub. It’s an ambitious idea, but wow is it ever complex, verbose, abstract and under defined.

** "I am not working with AP from a graph database.I am not working against a RDF data modelI am not dealing with RDF projectionsI am not an academic who is working with ontologies From a standards perspective: Every single time weirdness from RDF leaks into JSON, it adds complexity to downstream implementations. If your spec is entirely based on RDF that's one thing. But if your spec disclaims being based on RDF and says "only for extensions," then you can't have your cake and eat it too."
