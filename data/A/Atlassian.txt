'''<dfn>Atlassian</dfn>''' is an Australian company that makes several proprietary tools for software developers/project management, including the source hosting site [[Bitbucket]], [[Jira]] ([[issue]] tracking), and [[Confluence]] ([[wiki]]-like collaboration pages), offered both for local installation and as a service; consider using IndieWeb or other open source [[projects]] instead due to a new Australian law that ”might allow police to order engineers to program surveillance features into software behind their company’s back” according to EFF.
