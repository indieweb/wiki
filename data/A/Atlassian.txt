'''<dfn>Atlassian</dfn>''' is an Australian company that provides several [[silo]]-as-a-service services such as [[Jira]] ([[issue]] tracking), and [[Confluence]] ([[wiki]]-like collaboration pages); consider using IndieWeb or other open source [[projects]] instead due to a new Australian law that ”might allow police to order engineers to program surveillance features into software behind their company’s back” according to EFF.
