'''<dfn>ACM Hypertext Conference</dfn>''' is an annual academic conference on the subject of hypertext and typically the web, where both [[XFN]] and XMDP were presented in poster sessions in the mid 2000s, and in 1991 HTML was submitted but rejected (TimBL gave a poster); and their event sites for some years either died or were taken over by squatters (like ht04.org for 2004).
