<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>[http://umw.domains/ A Domain of One's Own]</dfn>''' (or '''<dfn>DoOO</dfn>''') started as a project at University of Mary Washington that allows students, faculty, and staff to register their own domain name and associate it with a hosted web space, free of charge.</span> With their Domain and corresponding web space, users will have the opportunity and flexibility to design and create a meaningful and vibrant digital presence.

The project name is a direct reference to Virginia Woolf’s essay [https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=201410N3 A Room of One’s Own] (1929) in which she writes:

<blockquote>“A woman must have money, and a room of her own, ​if she is to write fiction.”​</blockquote>

== Original Project ==
First developed at Mary Washington University, DoOO has grown as a movement that supports digital identity creation and data ownership, and allows for the publishing, curating, and sharing of work online.

The original A Domain of One’s Own is managed by the [http://academics.umw.edu/dtlt/ Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies (DTLT)] at UMW. It was founded by [http://jimgroom.net/about/ Jim Groom], subsequently the co-founder of [http://reclaimhosting.com/ Reclaim Hosting].

DTLT works with faculty and departments to meaningfully integrate DoOO into their classroom practices and programs in order to ensure that students are gaining varied and valuable digital experiences during their time at UMW. In addition, DTLT supports members of the UMW community to use DoOO to cultivate a digital profile for their professional work. Their site serves as a source of information about the project as well as a gateway for UMW users to login and manage their accounts.

<blockquote>“Faculty and students must have a domain and web hosting of their own if they are to truly understand and engage the deeper possibilities of the open web.” &mdash; Jim Groom (2013)</blockquote>

=== Technical Capabilities ===
Within the system, users may install LAMP-compatible Web applications, set up subdomains and email addresses, and install databases. In addition, users may choose to “map” their domain (or a subdomain) to other services, such as a UMW Blogs, Google Sites, or [[Tumblr]].
