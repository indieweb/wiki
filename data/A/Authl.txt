[https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Authl Authl] is a Python authentication wrapper/library by {{beesbuzz.biz}} intended to simplify setting up federated authentication for IndieWeb projects. It is primarily being developed for [[Publ CMS|Publ]] but it's being written with framework-independence in mind.

The general principle is that someone can log in using a URL on any service and it will attempt to determine the simplest/preferred authentication mechanism from it, essentially treating all providers as if they were IndieAuth providers.

It currently supports the following authentication mechanisms:

* Emailed magic links
* Mastodon (via OAuth)
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[IndieLogin]]

Support is planned for other mechanisms, including siloed OAuth providers such as Twitter, Facebook, and other silos supporting OpenID Connect.
