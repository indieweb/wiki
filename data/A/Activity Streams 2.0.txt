== Criticism ==
* Unspecified semantics leads to de facto semantics definition by largest implementation(s): https://hachyderm.io/@danderson/109459311884227844
** "Every time the activitystreams core and vocab spec say "we left the semantics of these bytes completely unspecified on purpose", I die a little inside. In practice this seems to mean "today's most popular implementation owns the semantics, and shouldn't feel obligated to document them" :(" [https://hachyderm.io/@danderson @danderson] December 5, 2022

* Criticism for using [[JSON-LD]] for extensions in AS2: https://hachyderm.io/@hrefna/111634273843633052
** "I am not working with AP from a graph database.I am not working against a RDF data modelI am not dealing with RDF projectionsI am not an academic who is working with ontologies From a standards perspective: Every single time weirdness from RDF leaks into JSON, it adds complexity to downstream implementations. If your spec is entirely based on RDF that's one thing. But if your spec disclaims being based on RDF and says "only for extensions," then you can't have your cake and eat it too."
