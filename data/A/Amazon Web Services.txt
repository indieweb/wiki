* Criticism: 2019-04-08 Gizmodo: [https://gizmodo.com/amazon-is-aggressively-pursuing-big-oil-as-it-stalls-ou-1833875828 Amazon Is Aggressively Pursuing Big Oil as It Stalls Out on Clean Energy] <blockquote>Google officially hit its target of powering its operations with 100 percent clean energy in early 2018. So did Apple. Facebook says it will get there by 2020. Microsoftâ€™s progress has been slower, but in 2018, it signed what was heralded as the largest corporate solar agreement in the U.S. Amazon appears to be the only major tech company so dramatically stalling out in its pursuit of renewables.</blockquote>
