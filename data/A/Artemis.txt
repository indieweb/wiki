'''<dfn>Artemis</dfn>''' is a calm web reader developed by {{capjamesg}} that updates once a day, has a minimal UI, and is free to use at https://artemis.jamesg.blog.

== The interface ==

=== Feed discovery ===

When you enter a URL that advertises multiple feeds with [[rel-alternate]], or supports [[h-feed]] along with [[RSS]], Artemis will prompt for which feed you want to preview and subscribe to.

In this example, the URL has both h-feed directly in the HTML and an Atom feed linked with rel-alternate. The first preview option is for the h-feed.
