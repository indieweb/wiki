== Amazon Author Pages ==
Amazon provides "Author Pages" for book authors, which you can set up through their "[https://authorcentral.amazon.com/ Author Central]" tool.

If you are an author of a book listed on Amazon, you can create your own author page.

* https://authorcentral.amazon.com/

You will need to verify your email address, then you'll be able to "claim" books on Amazon that are yours. Once you've logged in, you're given a dashboard where you can customize your author page, including adding a photo, choosing a custom URL, adding a bio, and even import a blog RSS feed to show on the page.

Author Central cannot be used to update any product information about your books.

* {{anomalily}} has an author page at https://amazon.com/author/lillian
