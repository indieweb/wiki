'''<dfn>Advanced [[WordPress]] Set up</dfn>''' is a set of additional options and/or upgrades that extend the document [[Getting Started on WordPress]].

As in most [[CMS]]es, there are many ways to do the same or similar things. While [[Getting Started on WordPress]] is meant for general beginners to take the quickest and easiest path to IndieWeb-ifying their personal site, there are additional and alternate options for many of the moving pieces. Many of these can be found below, roughly in the same order as on the getting started page. 

Advanced users and developers are more than welcome to browse through these as well as the [[WordPress/Plugins]] page. Additional guidance for portions can potentially be found on individual wiki pages for particular pieces of functionality in the IndieWeb Examples sections for members who identify as [[WordPress/Examples]].

== Rel-Me ==
{{main|rel-me}}
WordPress sites can add [[rel-me|rel="me"]] classes in several locations including:
* Indieweb Plugin ('''Recomended''', see details at [[Getting Started on WordPress#Identity]] ) 
* directly in the header (potentially with a plugin)
** [https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-webmaster/ All in One Webmaster] has a header/footer text boxes for adding html in the header
** [https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/ Insert Headers and Footers plugin]
* in a text widget to a sidebar, footer, or other location
* in the footer (see details for header above)
* For sites that have a (usually secondary) [https://en.support.wordpress.com/menus/social-links-menu/ social links menu], one can add the classes directly into the menu. On your site go to <code>/wp-admin/nav-menus.php</code> to create the menu; you may need to go to "Screen Options" pulldown in the top right corner and check the "Link Relationship (XFN)" option which will reveal a box into which one can simply type "me" to create the rel-me class on the URL.

Rel-me is usually added within an &lt;a> tag, but can also be done within a &lt;link> tag, so either of the following will usually work, however the link version isn't human readable (won't render on the web page) so you may forget it's there. If you do use link, it may be best done in the page header.

<pre>
<head>
     <link href="https://example.com" rel="me" />
     ...
</head>
</pre>

Or like this somewhere on your home page:

<pre><a href="https://example.com" rel="me" />Micro.blog</a></pre>

== Pull your content from other sites ==
If [[POSSE]] is not an option or can't be done for various reasons (see [[Instagram]] for example), you probably still have the possibility of pulling content ([[PESOS]]), automatically creating a "backup" on your site. 

Right now the most flexible way to do this on WordPress is the combination of  [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/ Keyring], [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-social-importers/ Keyring Social Importers], and [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-reactions-importer/ Keyring Reactions Importer] plugins. These are a little harder to configure plugins, mainly targeting semi-power-users, but they can import from an impressive amount of services out of the box and it's straightforward to extend their functionality.

For many other options (like [[OwnYourGram]], [https://wordpress.org/plugins/dsgnwrks-instagram-importer/ Dsgnwrks Instagram Importer], see also [[WordPress/Plugins]]

== Publish to Your Site with alternative interfaces  ==
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub Micropub for WordPress] - add support for the [[Micropub]] protocol to WordPress. This will allow the use of tools like [[OwnYourGram]], [[OwnYourCheckin]], [[Quill]], and potentially others in the future to post content to your WordPress site.

== Other functionalities ==
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webactions Webactions] - Adds [[webactions]] markup to WordPress elements
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this Indieweb Press-This] - Adds Indieweb markup to the WordPress [https://codex.wordpress.org/Press_This Press-This] [[Bookmarklet]]s to allow you to respond on your site with one-click
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/hum/ Hum URL Shortener] - A personal URL shortener framework
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-shortslug wp-shortslug] - another URL shortener
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieauth Indieauth] - The plugin lets you login to the WordPress backend via [[IndieAuth]]. It uses the URL from the profile page to identify the blog user.

== Themes ==
{{main|WordPress/Themes|WordPress Themes}}

Some WordPress themes are compatible with [[microformats]].  The Indieweb uses [[microformats2]], the latest version, to mark up sites so that they can be interpreted by other sites when retrieved. Most parsers will fall back onto the older format if available.

Formatting your site so other sites can consume the information allows for the communications Indieweb sites support. For example, a class of u-like-of added to a link to a site you liked to indicates that relationship.

There is only one theme in the WordPress repository that is fully microformats2 compliant. That is [https://wordpress.org/themes/sempress Sempress]. [https://wordpress.org/themes/independent-publisher/ Independent Publisher] also now uses microformats2 in addition to having custom code for better displaying webmentions in the comments section.

For existing themes, you can try out [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 wordpress-uf2], a plugin that tries to add microformats after the fact. Mileage may vary, as a plugin cannot do all that is required. Some themes that use microformats for styling instead of semantic markup may break or have spurious visual outputs when used with the uf2 plugin.

== Readers ==
A [[reader]] (or indie reader) is the portion/feature integrated into an indieweb site that provides a way to read content from other indieweb sites, possibly including posts from the current site as well. There are a few for WordPress including:
* [[PressForward]] - plugin that adds an integrated reader with additional features and functions; for [https://indieweb.org/reader#Chris_Aldrich additional details on features and installation]
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/blogroll2email/ blogroll2email] - oldschool feed to email reader using the blogroll feature of WordPress; supports RSS, Atom & [[microformats2]] feeds
