'''AirBnB Reviews''' is AirBnB's system for hosts rating guests and guests rating hosts after a stay.

== Review Detail ==
=== Guests Reviewing Hosts ===
AirBnB prompts a guest to leave a review for a host after the stay.

First, the site asks for a star rating from 1 to 5 stars, 5 being the best.

Next, the site asks to select from a predefined list to indicate in which areas the host did particularly well.

Third, the site asks to select how your stay compared to your expectations on a scale of "much worse" to "much better"

The fourth step asks to rate a number of elements on a star scale from 1 to 5, including cleanliness, accuracy of the listing, and more. These ratings are visible only to the host, not part of the public review.

If you choose anything except 5 stars, a text box appears below and asks for details.

Clicking "review tips" opens a window with a few things to keep in mind when writing a review:

<blockquote>
* Be honest, clear, and detailed.
* Use specific examples when you can.
* Share what surprised or delighted you.
* Include info, good or bad, a future guest should know before booking.
</blockquote>

After completing the text review, the site shows a confirmation with some text indicating the purpose of having filled out the review.
