'''<dfn>[http://www.apple.com/news/ Apple News]</dfn>''' is an iOS app for reading stories published in [[Apple News Format]], for which there are no known examples of IndieWeb publishers.

'''needs screenshots''' — we need screenshots of Apple News as a reader, as apparently its UX is nice enough that there is anecdotal evidence that people use it as a primary reader, thus missing the opportunity to follow blogs like you can in a [[social reader]].
