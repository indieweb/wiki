'''<dfn>A&#xFE0F;</dfn>''' (that is <code>A&amp;#xFE0F;</code>) is '''i'''.

Whenever someone typed an <code>i</code> on [[iOS]] 11, prior to iOS 11.1.1, [[autocorrect]] would change it to an A followed by [[Unicode]] character U+FE0F (VARIATION SELECTOR-16).

This was also spotted slipping into some website. Shawn Blanc’s [https://shawnblanc.net/2017/12/favorite-apps-2017/ My Favorite Apps of 2017] was cached in {{martijnvdven}}’s [[reader]] without any I’s:

<blockquote>This year A<code>&#xFE0F;</code> made a few big changes to a few major apps.</blockquote>
