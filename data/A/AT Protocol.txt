'''<dfn>AT Protocol</dfn>''' or <dfn>Authenticated Transfer Protocol</dfn>, previously known as <dfn>Authenticated Data Experiment</dfn> (<abbr>ADX</abbr>), is a federated social network protocol, designed and first implemented by the [[Bluesky]] project, subsequently supported by IndieWeb-friendly service [[micro.blog]] and libraries. The term "Atmosphere" can be used to describe the ecosystem around the AT Protocol.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Currently the only IndieWeb Examples are hardcoded to post directly to [[Bluesky]] rather than arbitrary AT Protocol supporting services.

<blockquote> Your list of blocked users is ''public''. Anyone can see it through the API. Someone harassing you? They, and all of their buddies, will know as soon as you block them. People can build profiles of who's ripe for harassment just by searching for large blocklists.</blockquote>

* 2025-12-27 [https://mastodon.social/@mcc @mcc]: [[backfill]] is [https://mastodon.social/@mcc/115793416589273402 still a problem for actual ATproto/Bluesky decentralization] (currently [https://docs.bsky.app/blog/introducing-tap being worked on]): 
<blockquote>Follow up, 2025-12-27: Rudy [https://bsky.app/profile/rude1.blacksky.team/post/3maykethsbk24 here] confirms the Blacksky appview is still being worked on (eg: blacksky uses bluesky's appview still)  The sticking point, as he describes it, is "backfill". This alludes to the issue that makes me compare ATProto to blockchain: to get the features users expect, every node on the network must mirror the network's entire history. This is impractical, which is why bluesky is as of this moment a federated network with effectively only one node.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The likely answer to this is that there will always have to be a large corporation at the heart of Bluesky/ATProto, and the network will have to rely on that corporation to do the work of abuse mitigation, particularly in terms of illegal content and spam. This may be a good enough solution for Bluesky's purposes, but on the economics alone it's going to be a centralized system that relies on trusting centralized authorities.</blockquote>
