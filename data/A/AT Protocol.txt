{{stub}}
'''<dfn>AT Protocol</dfn>''' or <dfn>Authenticated Transfer Protocol</dfn>, previously known as <dfn>Authenticated Data Experiment</dfn> (<abbr>ADX</abbr>), is a federated social network protocol, designed and first implemented by the [[Bluesky]] project, subsequently supported by IndieWeb-friendly service [[micro.blog]] and libraries. The term "Atmosphere" can be used to describe the ecosystem around the AT Protocol.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Currently the only IndieWeb Examples are hardcoded to post directly to [[Bluesky]] rather than arbitrary AT Protocol supporting services.

=== In progress support ===
* See also AT Protocol analysis here: 
** https://fed.brid.gy/docs#translate

== Libraries ==
* [https://github.com/capjamesg/pyatproto pyatproto]: A Python package with abstract methods for interacting with the AT Protocol API, specifically for the Bluesky social network.
** Caveat: There are some hard-coded Bluesky method names in this library, so the current version will not work with other AT Protocol implementations. The plan is to change this as new servers become available.

== Criticism ==
=== Blocks Publicly Accessible via API ===

<blockquote> Your list of blocked users is ''public''. Anyone can see it through the API. Someone harassing you? They, and all of their buddies, will know as soon as you block them. People can build profiles of who's ripe for harassment just by searching for large blocklists.</blockquote>
* Official overview: [https://docs.bsky.app/blog/block-implementation Why are blocks on Bluesky public?]
** The converse argument is that blocks on Mastodon are opaque and under the control of your instance host, not part of your account.

=== Heavy Architecture ===
* 2025-12-27 [https://mastodon.social/@mcc @mcc]: [[backfill]] is [https://mastodon.social/@mcc/115793416589273402 still a problem for actual ATproto/Bluesky decentralization]: 
<blockquote>Follow up, 2025-12-27: Rudy [https://bsky.app/profile/rude1.blacksky.team/post/3maykethsbk24 here] confirms the Blacksky appview is still being worked on (eg: blacksky uses bluesky's appview still)  The sticking point, as he describes it, is "backfill". This alludes to the issue that makes me compare ATProto to blockchain: to get the features users expect, every node on the network must mirror the network's entire history. This is impractical, which is why bluesky is as of this moment a federated network with effectively only one node.</blockquote> 

** Backfill is being worked on; there is an open source project Tap that will backfill selected parts of the full repository or firehose. [https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/tree/main/cmd/tap code]  [https://docs.bsky.app/blog/introducing-tap announcement] 

** Mastodon makes no provision for backfill at all, accordingly it always lacks 'the features users expect'

<blockquote>ATProto's complicated architecture more or less puts running an alternative app into the realm of well-funded nonprofits and startups, as opposed to Mastodon instances which can easily be run by hobbyists on their own domestic hardware.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The likely answer to this is that there will always have to be a large corporation at the heart of Bluesky/ATProto, and the network will have to rely on that corporation to do the work of abuse mitigation, particularly in terms of illegal content and spam. This may be a good enough solution for Bluesky's purposes, but on the economics alone it's going to be a centralized system that relies on trusting centralized authorities.</blockquote>
