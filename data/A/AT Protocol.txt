{{stub}}
'''<dfn>AT Protocol</dfn>''' or <dfn>Authenticated Transfer Protocol</dfn>, previously known as <dfn>Authenticated Data Experiment</dfn> (<abbr>ADX</abbr>), is a federated social network protocol, designed and first implemented by the [[Bluesky]] project, subsequently supported by IndieWeb-friendly service [[micro.blog]] and libraries. 

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Currently the only IndieWeb Examples are hardcoded to post directly to [[Bluesky]] rather than arbitrary AT Protocol supporting services.
* See: [[Bluesky#IndieWeb_Examples]]

== Service Support ==
* [[Bluesky]]
* [[micro.blog]] per 2023-04-29 {{manton}}: [https://www.manton.org/2023/04/29/getting-started-with.html Getting started with Bluesky XRPC]

=== In progress support ===
* [[Bridgy Fed]] is working on adding support for AT Protocol
** https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/381
* See also AT Protocol analysis here: 
** https://fed.brid.gy/docs#translate

== Libraries ==
* [https://github.com/capjamesg/pyatproto pyatproto]: A Python package with abstract methods for interacting with the AT Protocol API, specifically for the Bluesky social network.
** Caveat: There are some hard-coded Bluesky method names in this library, so the current version will not work with other AT Protocol implementations. The plan is to change this as new servers become available.

== History ==
"ADX" iteration of the protocol renamed to “Authenticated Transfer Protocol” — or the “AT Protocol.” https://atproto.com/
