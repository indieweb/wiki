== Plugins ==
=== WordPress plugin ===
As of 2018-08-13, there is a [https://wordpress.org/plugins/aperture/ WordPress plugin] available to assist with adding Aperture support to WordPress by auto-registering one's site and adding the appropriate microsub endpoint to one's website header. This prevents one from needing to sign up at https://aperture.p3k.io and manually adding the endpoint. The [https://github.com/aaronpk/aperture-wordpress development version of the plugin is available on GitHub] where [https://github.com/aaronpk/aperture-wordpress/issues issues can be filed]. This plugin '''does not''' add [[microsub]] support to WordPress.
