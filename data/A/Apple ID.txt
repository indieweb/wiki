'''<dfn>[https://appleid.apple.com Apple ID]</dfn>''' is a universal [[identity]] system from [[Apple]] that they use on [[iOS]] and [[macOS]] systems as well as their [[iCloud]] service.

== Criticism ==
=== Fearmongering Security UI ===
Apple ID, in particular on MacOS 10.13 High Sierra, presents a very scary dialog if you don't go along with their [[TFA]] prompting (which just happens to force you to use [[SMS]] for TFA).

You literally have to choose the scarier option "Don't Upgrade" if you want to avoid / postpone / never setup [[SMS]] as your second factor.

* Criticism: As of 2022 (perhaps earlier), creating a new AppleID requires a phone number that can receive a text message or a phone call.
* Criticism: As of 2022, once you add a phone number to an AppleID (which Apple prompts you to do every time you upgrade your iOS or MacOS), you cannot remove it if it is the only number connected to the AppleID
* If you have an existing AppleID *without* a phone number, DO NOT associate a phone number to it as you won't be able to de-associate it later.
