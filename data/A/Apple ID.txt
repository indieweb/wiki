'''<dfn>[https://appleid.apple.com Apple ID]</dfn>''' is a universal [[identity]] system from [[Apple]] that they use on [[iOS]] and [[macOS]] systems as well as their [[iCloud]] service.

== Criticism ==
=== Fearmongering Security UI ===
Apple ID, in particular on MacOS 10.13 High Sierra, presents a very scary dialog if you don't go along with their [[TFA]] prompting (which just happens to force you to use [[SMS]] for TFA).

You literally have to choose the scarier option "Don't Upgrade" if you want to avoid / postpone / never setup [[SMS]] as your second factor.
