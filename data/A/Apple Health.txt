'''<dfn>Apple Health</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Health</dfn>) is an [[iOS]] app from [[Apple]] that allows users to track data collected by [[HealthKit]], which includes things like [[sleep]] tracking, heart rate, steps, [[exercise]]s, and more, which are collected via the [[Apple Watch]] and the [[iPhone]].

== Brainstorming ==
=== iOS app to export data ===
Create an [[iOS]] app that has [[HealthKit]] permissions and serializes all collected data (or some subset of it) to JSON, then sends it up to a web service which stores it. Then, a user can authenticate with this web service using [[IndieAuth]], choose which bits of data that they want to publish to their site via [[Micropub]], and on what frequency.

Some good tools that may be helpful:

* [[Granola]]
* [[Open mHealth Schemas]]
* [[HumanAPI]]
