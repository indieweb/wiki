'''<dfn>Apache</dfn>''' is widely deployed open source web server software.

== HTTP 406 Not Acceptable Error ==

In some cases, Apache returns HTTP 406 when fetched from a client that does not include <code>*/*</code> in the Accept header. This is due to a common misconfiguration where PHP is enabled by using the <code>AddType</code> declaration instead of a proper solution.

This error surfaced when [[XRay]] was unable to fetch posts on adactio.com because XRay does not include <code>*/*</code> in its Accept header. The fix was to remove the <code>AddType</code> declaration and include the below instead.

<pre><Files "*.php">
    MultiviewsMatch Any
</Files></pre>


== Permissions ==

Summary (from [http://serverfault.com/questions/357108/what-are-the-best-linux-permissions-to-use-for-my-website serverfault thread]):

* Apache usually runs as the www-data, which will at the very least need read access to files
* “Application” files (e.g. *.php) don’t need execute permissions as they’re not directly executed by the web server, they only need read permissions
* Your user should own the files
* The www-data user should own the group, which should have read and execute (why execute?) permissions
* Any files or folders which will be changed by apache need to have write (+w) permissions for the group owner
* Run <code>umask XXX</code> to set the default permissions for newly created files. <code>umask 007</code> sets permissions to read+write for owner and group, no permissions for others, which is a sensible default

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Notation_of_traditional_Unix_permissions wikipedia] has a clear explanation of the unix permissions shorthand.
