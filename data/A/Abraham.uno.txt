<h1>Rajiv Abraham</h1>
Hi, I'm Rajiv Abraham.
<h2>History</h2>
I'm new to the IndieWeb, though you can call me an indie blogger as I have been blogging on self-hosted WordPress blogs since 2004.

WordPress simply because I’m not a coder and not skilled enough with HTML and/or CSS. I’m definitely in the GUI and WYSIWYG category and a lot more comfortable with content creation and words than the technical aspects of blogging.
<h2>Goals</h2>
I discovered Micro.Blog and then the IndieWeb from there. I initially tried to IndieWebify my blog, only to Un-IndieWebify it because the plug-ins did not work as advertised out of the box, and required some coding and assembly.

After getting back to blogging and WordPress (I have been on a sabbatical since 2014) I decided to IndieWebify my blog 2.0 with the intention to see it through even if it meant some assembly required.
<h2>Find Me</h2>
