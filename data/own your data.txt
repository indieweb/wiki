'''<dfn>own your data</dfn>''' is one of the [[principles]] of the IndieWeb and is an encouragement to always post content directly to your own [[domain]] with [[permalinks]] that you control instead of posting to [[silos]] (or only posting <em>copies</em> of your posts to silos per [[POSSE]], and if so, preferably both automatically & with [[permashortlink]]s back to your original posts).

== Why ==
See '''[[why]]'''.

__TOC__
== How ==
=== The Basics ===
See and follow these in order:
* [[Getting started]]
* [[IndieMark]]

=== Per Silo ===
Commit to owning your data by using your site, instead of a silo, for each silo you currently use. 

Each silo you stop directly using ([[POSSE]] is ok), and use your own site instead, is a step forward in owning your data.

=== Per Post Type ===
Commit to owning each kind of post you publish, by using <em>only</em> your site to publish particular [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|kinds of posts]] (again, [[POSSE]] is ok).

Each kind of post you stop posting directly to <em>any/all</em> silo(s), and use always use your own site to create instead, is a step forward in owning your data.

=== Per Post Type Per Silo ===
A more incremental but still significant step is stop posting a particular type of post to a particular silo, and always use your own site to publish that type of post instead of that silo.

Add yourself here if you:
* have an indieweb site, and 
* are using it '''exclusively''' to post either 
** a particular kind of [[post]] (e.g. [[notes]]), and/or 
** if you are posting to your site completely '''instead of''' a particular [[silo]] (e.g. [[Twitter]])
and note what date you started '''owning your data''' of what kind(s) of posts, or instead of which silo(s).

For the purpose of this page, please succinctly list, <em>only</em>
* '''specific silo(s)''' you have replaced usage of with your own site. E.g.: I use my own site instead of Twitter (notes, replies, favorites)
* '''post type(s)''' you use your own site for instead of / before any silo posts. E.g.: I post notes on my own site instead of Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc.
* '''post type(s) instead of specific silo''' - what post type you use your own site for instead of / before a specific silo. E.g.: I post notes & replies on my own site instead of Twitter.

Optional details, for each of the above post types / or "instead of silos", optionally note which [[projects]] or tools help you do so.

'''Examples of what doesn't count:'''
* You post some notes on your own site, and some notes directly to [[Twitter]].
** Why: All or nothing. Either you've committed and are following through with posting <em>all</em> your content of a specific kind to your own site, or you don't yet "own your data" of that type.

'''Examples of what belongs on your user page instead:'''
* owned other things besides post types / instead of silos (sites, domain names, project installs)
* what other sites you post to

'''Examples of what doesn't disqualify you:'''
* A small number of '''test''' posts on any given silo of any given content type, especially if you're doing it as research for how to best [[POSSE]] to that silo, especially if you <em>document</em> the results of your research here on the wiki. Though for research purposes, you really should create one or more separate test accounts on silos.

* instead of '''[[Twitter]]''', posted on his own site:
** '''notes''' [http://tantek.com/2010/001/t1/declaring-independence-building-it since 2010-01-01], POSSE to Twitter [https://twitter.com/t/status/8228455558 since 2010-01-26]
** '''@-[[replies]]''' [http://tantek.com/2013/132/t2/been-t-since-day-joined-2006 since 2013-05-12], POSSEd to Twitter (same day).
** '''[[favorites]]''' as [[likes]], [http://tantek.com/2014/365/f since 2014-12-31], using Bridgy Publish to POSSE likes of tweets to favoriting those tweets on Twitter.

Notes: 
* '''not yet ownyourreplies.''' I can't say I yet I follow "ownyourdata" for ALL my replies, as I have posted replies directly to posts on [[Facebook]], whereas I should be posting even those replies on my own site first, and then POSSEing them to Facebook, perhaps via [[Bridgy]] publish. Thus I've scoped my "ownyourdata" of replies to only being a replacement for my use of Twitter to post replies.
* '''not yet ownyourlikes.''' I also can't yet say I follow "ownyourdata" for ALL my likes, as I still like photos directly on [[Instagram]], and posts on [[Facebook]].
