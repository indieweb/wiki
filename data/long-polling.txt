'''<dfn>Long-polling</dfn>''' is a common technique to create a ''push''-like experience through ''polling'' by having the ''poll'' request wait for an item when there are none ready, rather than return an empty response.

== Uses ==

* On the client-side long-polling has been a common technique to implement [[realtime]] experiences. It has now started to be superseded by [[eventsource]], [[websockets]] and web [[push notification]]s as supported by [https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/01/web-push-arrives-in-firefox-44/ Firefox] and Chrome. Long-polling can also be used to [https://github.com/amvtek/EventSource polyfill eventsource].
* [[Amazon SQS]] has [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html support for long-polling] to reduce the number of requests needed when the queue is empty.
