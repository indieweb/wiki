'''<dfn>www</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb is an unnecessary [[subdomain]] on personal [[domain name]]. "www." used to be expected as a convention for websites on a domain, but has long since been abandoned.

On the other hand: the ''www'' subdomain can be useful when hosting a site on another provider's architecture ([[Withknown.com]], [[Google App Engine]], [[Heroku]], [[Amazon S3]], [[GitHub Pages]] or a [[CDN]]). To support a custom domain name and still provide load balancing, these services usually require a CNAME record pointing from your domain to a domain name they control. You cannot create a CNAME record for a naked domain, so www is a useful default.
