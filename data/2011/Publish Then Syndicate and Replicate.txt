===Notes from [[Amber Case]]===

Sending out something once and having it go to your website too. "I think the best thing to do is to post to your personal domain and then push out -- then the third party service doesn't have access to it." - Tantek 

If you want to have the comments come back, then you use salmon -- salmon is how you have the comments to flow back upstream. salmon-protocol.org

Has anyone made a sit hewer they're publishing it out to other social profiles. 

And have it salmoning back information and profiles to you. Having an API call, and get the replies back to a particular tweet to see if something had changes and pushing that over to your site. 

People would comment on the content thinking the person was there, then they were not not able to get the comments. 

The content and responses ids to be pushed back to the person who pouched out the comment. 

If you make a follow on comment it needs to be able to tell the other comments are there. 

Ward: if your content is floating around from place to place, you need to be able to see the history of the item and that's where it went. Upstream duplicate is a longer name for trail. The important thing is to get a system that's working. 

It's important to have the trail as part of the metadata, where supported, and not as part of the content. 

Reid: If this person can tell that this person is the same here as over here -- then it works well. It is important for people to have a sense of identity over multiple networks.

====Notes From Will Norris ====

Being indie (while hip and awesome) is not good enough.  How do you stay connected with you friends that are on major networks?

Basic premise of PthenS is to author the content on your own domain, and push out to your account(s) on other networks.  Ideally, there should be a way to get content back as well.  All copies should point back to the original source (via personal short URL).

This should be a seemless experience for your friends on major networks (they shouldn't have to know that you are self-publishing).  PubSubHubbub (PuSH) and Salmon (http://salmon-protocol.org) allow content to be syndicated in real-time.

Messina: Simply syndicating your content to various large silos is not sufficient.  Subsequent conversations may happen in these silos, but if you are not present, you're missing all of that.  This results in "ghost" identities (common example is Twitter content pulled into Facebook).

Ward: linking in the full conversation trail is important, but probably as metadata, not part of the content

Buzz calls this "upstream duplicate" in the API

Grigsby: I question the real value of pulling in and intermingling all of the conversations from large silos.  Tantek: That may be true... we don't know.  I'd rather we try and fail, than not try at all.  We don't necessarily need to copy everything everywhere.

Tantek: most of the comments I've seen is follows the pattern of: Commenter A, author replies to Commenter A, then Commenter B posts, then author replies to Commenter B, etc.  If we limit it to this simpler module, we'll gain more traction.

Tantek: How long as salmon been in development?  2 years?  I think there's an opportunity for someone to just Build Something That Works, and extrapolate a protocol from there.
