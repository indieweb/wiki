First session of the 2011 [[Schedule]].

Last year we had the [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/ Federated Social Web Summit].

It was:
* [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/FedAll2010/Invitations invite only] , focused on implementers
* had some design, mostly talk, no actual coding
* since absorbed into [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/ W3C Federated Social Web Incubator Group], now mostly talking (e.g. nothing was built out of the 2011 June Berlin W3C Federated Social Web Summit).
* a bunch of us decided we needed something more practical, personal, actionable

What is Indie Web Camp
* Indie - why
** shared sites go away ([http://pownce.com/ Pownce], [http://closing.vox.com/ Vox], [http://geocities.yahoo.com/index.php Geocities], [http://etherpad.com/transition.html Etherpad], [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html Google Wave], ...)
** get overloaded ([http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2571/3927590515_c3c6be51a9_o.png Twitter], ...)
** go down for maintenance ([http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/420426227_dda4d24789_o.png Flickr], [http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5322875194_908d728816_b.jpg Twitter BB client], ...)

* Builders - [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/2010-199-tantek-fsws-talk scratching your own itches]
* Share (e.g. culture of open source, [http://opensourcebridge.org/ Open Source Bridge])
** together we can build, iterate, faster than alone. that's why you're here this weekend

Plan for two days: Get Inspired And Make Things (Jeremy Keith's t-shirt as prop)
* today: talks/discussions
* tomorrow: building sessions, design, code, collaborate

Introductions:
* name
* URL
* 3 things you've built/broken/shared or want to build break share

Any questions?
