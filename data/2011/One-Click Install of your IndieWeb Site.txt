'''<dfn>One-Click Install of your IndieWeb Site</dfn>''' was one of the idea brainstorming sessions at IndieWebCamp [[2011]].

== Wordpress five-minute install ==

Wordpress's famous five-minute install is the bar for how easy it should be to get your own instance of a personal indie website. Our job is to make it at least that simple or we will exclude all but the most technically savvy. This session was dedicated to identifying a UX flow so we can start building a working prototype.

WORDPRESS MODEL of custom installation
* download the zip
* have domain & hosting
* upload files via FTP
* set up a dbase via cpanel
**Falcon uses a flat file db architecture that removes this step

== Info for an install ==
INITIAL INFO that must be gather from user
* name
* email
* password
* domain
* hosting credentials
* payment for hosting ?

== Open questions ==
OPEN QUESTIONS
* Is there a indieweb subdomained model similar to subdomain.tumblr.com that would make an indieweb site available to those not willing or able to do their own custom install?
* What language/stack? PHP favored for its low cost of hosting. Other options include github and AWS bc it has a completely web-based interface and would eliminate the need for users to understand FTP.
* How far can we get with just static hosting and a CNAME, with a CPU at home doing smart stuff? (ie. Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Files, NearlyFreeSpeech.net)
* Are VMs unreasonable to build on? Consider Vagrant + Puppet. Build a friendlier installer around Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud Servers, or even a home PC running VirtualBox + pagekite.net
