==Notes from [[User:Tantek|Tantek]]==

===Open Source Analytics===
Packages you can install on your site to self-host your own analytics (rather than depending on Google analytics).

* Matomo - [https://matomo.org https://matomo.org] (formerly Piwik)
* Awstats - http://awstats.sourceforge.net
* OWA - http://openwebanalytics.com

=== Google Analytics ===
http://google.com/analytics

Use https://www.google.com/support/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=55578 to create custom URLs per downstream syndicated service, e.g. Twitter, FB, etc.

FAQ:
* Q: What about page speed delays due to loading Google Analytics external javascript?
** A: Google tracks in Google Webmaster tools.
** A: If you download Google Analytics to your site and use the current version, it's Google Analytics Async (been around for a while). The old versions aren't supported any more. However, old sites/plugins may be using the older synchronous versions, and thus their speeds may be unnecessarily slowed down.
