'''<dfn>[[wikipedia:en:.io|.io]]</dfn>''' is the [[ccTLD]] for British Indian Ocean Territory, a top level domain in use by several IndieWeb (and adjacent) personal sites, services, and projects, and as of 2024 in a state of potential transition.

If you are looking for other uses of '''io''' see:
* '''[[io]]'''

.io is comparatively expensive ($39 on gandi.net at the time of writing), but easy to set up, and perhaps valuable as a novelty TLD for IndieWeb purposes because of IO's input/output double meaning. There are no known administrative problems establishing .io domains.

== Phasing out ==
⚠️ Possible phasing out within five years:

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb folks using .io short URLs as their primary site:
* werd.io: {{benwerd}}
* bret.io: {{bret}}
* {{cleverdevil}}
** https://cleverdevil.io/pages/dot-io-supporting-chagos
as services / utility sites:
* *.p3k.io subdomains: {{aaronpk}}, like quill.p3k.io, monocle.p3k.io, etc. (see [[p3k]] for more)
** moving these to .app domains over time, e.g. xray.p3k.app

== Criticism ==
The .io TLD has been criticized for generating profits for the British government instead of the people of the Indian Ocean Territory (unlike other [[ccTLD]]s for small island nations like .me or .tv).<blockquote>"[P]rofits from the sale of each .io domain flow to the very force that expelled the Chagossian or Ilois people from their equatorial land just a generation or two ago: the British government."</blockquote>from [https://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal The dark side of .io: How the U.K. is making web domain profits from a shady Cold War land deal].
