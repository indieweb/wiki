==== WhisperFollow ====
'''<dfn>[http://wordpress.org/plugins/whisperfollow/ WhisperFollow]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] based social [[reader]] create by [[User:acegiak.net|acegiak]] that currently supports [[H-Entry]], [[RSS]], [[Atom]] and [[PubSubHubbub]].

Whisperfollow aggregates feed data from sites in the users blogroll and presents them on a private page in a dashboard/wall format. The plugin also allows the user to comment on, repost or like these posts from the dashboard page.

These responses are called Whispers in the system and are created as aside posts in the whispers category with the custom fields contextTarget, context and contextLike.

The follow page also has a "quick follow" box which allows a user to enter a site's url and the plugin will sniff out any followable feeds and add it to the blogroll.
