'''<dfn>feedly</dfn>''' is a server-based [[feed]] aggregator and [[reader]].

== Issues ==
=== Fails To Handle Atom XHTML titles ===
See bug report:
* https://plus.google.com/110760594609453531817/posts/2J3wWDsJFnU
** 2015-08-26 appears to be fixed? https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/re-feedly-title-fix

Consider putting this for your [[Atom]] title element (inside the entry element) to help encourage users to encourage getting this bug fixed (and stay fixed! live regression tests are a good thing.)

<code style="white-space:pre-wrap"><nowiki>
<title type="xhtml">
<div class="if-your-feed-reader-displays-this-then-it-is-violating-the-Atom-spec-RFC-4287-section-4.2.14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
YOUR POST NAME GOES HERE
</div></title>
</nowiki></code>

=== No Offline Support ===

Feedly native app on Android (and iOS??) does not load anything when offline. So one cannot read posts even tough they had been previously downloaded.
