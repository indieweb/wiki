=== 2014-10-02 DB connection lost ===
On 2014-10-02 all Keybase profiles and key lookups failed (for minutes? hours?) due to: <blockquote>Yeah we lost the DB connection in our Web process so all queries were failing. Weird, first time we've seen that bug.[https://twitter.com/maxtaco/status/517766680240324608]</blockquote>
