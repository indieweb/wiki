== FAQ ==
'''Q:''' Why does RelMeAuth need a silo backlink?

'''A:''' RelMeAuth is composed of two building blocks, [[rel-me]], and [[OAuth]]. rel-me requires bidirectional linking for confirmation of identity consolidation.

There are also usability, error detection, and recovery reasons for keeping such a double opt-in mechanism when delegating authentication. For example, it prevents one from delegating their RelMeAuth to another person's silo account.
