An '''<dfn>article</dfn>''' is a kind of [[post]] that typically has more structure than a simple [[note]]. Articles usually have a name (title), multiple paragraphs, and often subheadings, blockquotes, and a footer of references or citations.

__TOC__
There are plenty of examples of IndieWeb sites posting articles, as articles essentially represent what used to simply be called "blog posts".

{{gRegor}} has been publishing articles using [[Nucleus]] since 2002-01-26:

** At the time, I treated my site more like a journal and the design did not use titles for each post. In later years, I added default titles for entries missing them.
