'''<dfn>[http://nanowrimo.org/ National Novel Writing Month]</dfn>''' (typically shortened '''NaNoWriMo''') is a challenge to write a 50,000-word novel (or other extended work) in the month of November.

Other versions of this can include things like [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AcWriMo&src=typed_query&f=live #AcWriMo] which involve academic/research writing.
