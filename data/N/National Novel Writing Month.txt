'''<dfn>[http://nanowrimo.org/ National Novel Writing Month]</dfn>''' (typically shortened '''NaNoWriMo''') is a challenge to write a 50,000-word novel (or other extended work) in the month of [[November]].

Other versions of this can include things like [http://www.phd2published.com/acwri-2/acbowrimo/about/ #AcWriMo] which involve academic/research writing.
