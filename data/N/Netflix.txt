Netflix.com home page with message: <blockquote><p>Netflix Site Error</p><p>We were unable to process your request.</p><p>Please go to the Netflix home page by clicking the button below.</p></blockquote>

The @Netflixhelps support account acknowledged the outage:
<blockquote>[https://twitter.com/Netflixhelps/status/707699033473585152 We're aware that members are seeing issues (Netflix Site Errors) on our website along with errors on devices. We are working towards a fix.]</blockquote>
