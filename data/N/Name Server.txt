A '''<dfn>Name Server</dfn>''' is something you configure on your [[domain registrar]] to point to your [[web host]]; itâ€™s part of how someone views your website, from typing your domain name into a browser, which looks up your domain name and finds your registrar, whose name servers point to your web host, which then serves your personal site to the browser.

== How to ==
=== How to configure ===
When you login to your [[domain registrar]], find a place to edit or configure your domain.

There you should see a field or option to set:
* '''Name Servers'''
with a text field of entries like:
<pre>
ns1.example.com
ns2.example.com
ns3.example.com
</pre>

Get the values for those entries from your [[web host]].
