'''<dfn>[http://nuzzel.com Nuzzel]</dfn>''' is a [[discovery|discovery-based]] service that surfaces articles and news based upon how many of your contacts on [[silo|silos]] like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn link to or interact with sources on those services. 

The service also allows simple curation for sending a regular [[newsletter|newsletter(s)]] based on your topics of choice.

Discovery of particular news articles can be easily done in the service by a variety of methods including:
* friends
* friends of friends
* by importing Twitter lists
* subscribing to friends' feeds
* featured feeds curated by the service itself

The news articles are presented with [[link-preview|link previews]] as well as the commentary from your contacts'/friends' silo-based posts.

The service also keeps track of stories that users have recently [[read]] on it though it doesn't make it simple to export those lists.

On the desktop application you can interact with the tweets from your followers that sent the articles.

== User Interface ==

== Criticism ==
Due to the network effect nuzzel may help spread misleading news or often older news articles that people do not consider currency before sharing. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2019-02-04/1549323533650000]
