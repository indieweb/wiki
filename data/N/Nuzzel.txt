'''<dfn>[http://nuzzel.com Nuzzel]</dfn>''' is a [[discovery|discovery-based]] service that surfaces articles and news based upon how many of your contacts on [[silo|silos]] like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn link to or interact with sources on those services. 


The service also allows simple curation for sending a regular [[newsletter|newsletter(s)]] based on your topics of choice.

Discovery of particular news articles can be easily done in the service by a variety of methods including:
* friends
* friends of friends
* by importing Twitter lists
* subscribing to friends' feeds
* featured feeds curated by the service itself

The news articles are presented with [[link-preview|link previews]] as well as the commentary from your contacts'/friends' silo-based posts.

The service also keeps track of stories that users have recently [[read]] on it though it doesn't make it simple to export those lists.

On the desktop application you can interact with the tweets from your followers that sent the articles.

== History ==
The app was originally started by Jonathan Abrams and was [https://scroll.blog/2019/02/07/scroll-is-acquiring-nuzzel/ sold to Scroll on 2019-02-07]. Scroll indicated they would be removing ads from the newsletters and spinning out the business intelligence portion of Nuzzel's business.

== Criticism ==
Due to the network effect Nuzzel may help spread misleading news or often older news articles that people do not consider the currency of before sharing. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2019-02-04/1549323533650000]
