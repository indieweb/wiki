'''<dfn>[https://www.netlify.com Netlify]</dfn>''' is a CDN/static hosting provider with integrated build service, useful for [[static site generator]]s.

Netlify provides continuous deployment of static sites (example, built using [[hugo]], and provides hosting for those too. The condition is that all site content has to be purely '''static'''.. so no scripts running on their server.

Here's a typical flow for deploying sites through Netlify:

Assuming that the user has already linked their online git repo (like [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]], [[Bitbucket]]) with their Netlify account,

# User commits changes to the git repo holding the source of their static site.
# Netlify receive that commit ping, and triggers a fresh build of the user's site using that latest commit.
# Netlify deploys that site at the domain the user configured.

== Limitations ==

* As Netlify needs the served sites to be 100% static, they cannot run any script (PHP, etc.) to serve as an [[endpoint]] for [[Webmention]], [[micropub]], etc.
* Endpoints for such Netlify-hosted sites need to be hosted separately somewhere else.
* '''TODO''': Someone who knows how to get around this limitation needs to update this section with that solution.
