'''<dfn>[https://www.netlify.com Netlify]</dfn>''' is a CDN/static hosting provider with integrated build service, useful for [[static site generator]]s.

Netlify provides continuous deployment of static sites (example, built using [[hugo]], and provides hosting for those too. The condition is that all site content has to be purely '''static'''.. so no scripts running on their server.

== How to ==
Here's a typical flow for deploying sites through Netlify:

Assuming that the user has already linked their online git repo (like [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]], [[Bitbucket]]) with their Netlify account,

# User commits changes to the git repo holding the source of their static site.
# Netlify receive that commit ping, and triggers a fresh build of the user's site using that latest commit.
# Netlify deploys that site at the domain the user configured.

== Limitations ==

As Netlify needs the served sites to be 100% static, they cannot run any script (PHP, etc.) to serve as an [[endpoint]] for [[Webmention]], [[micropub]], etc., endpoints for such Netlify-hosted sites need to be hosted separately somewhere else. 

However, Netlify does offer a [[serverless]] functions platform called [https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/ Functions] which https://piperswe.me/ has written about using for Serverless [[Indieauth]] at https://piperswe.me/posts/serverless-indieauth/ [https://web.archive.org/web/20190423134844/https://piperswe.me/posts/serverless-indieauth/ (Archive)]. They also have an [https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/faster-builds-for-large-sites-on-netlify-with-on-demand-builders-now-in-early-access/ early-access feature] to build individual pages on-demand for sites with large numbers of pages.

{{jamietanna}} has https://micropub-media-endpoint-proxy.netlify.com/ which is a service to allow uploading files directly to the media endpoint, which uses Netlify Functions for proxying the request to the user's media endpoint.

== Criticism ==
* No reasonable default spending limits, will bill you $100k and give no recourse till you get the CEO's attention: https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b14bty/netlify_just_sent_me_a_104k_bill_for_a_simple/
** As of 11th Dec 2024: Netlify now offers a "Free Plan", which caps all spending limits at $0 and no longer requires a credit card for registration. Upgrading to the "Starter Plan" can be done at any time, which re-enables the "scaling" features that can cost money, but if you stay on Free then there should no longer be any concerns with sudden, unexpected bills. See: https://www.netlify.com/blog/introducing-netlify-free-plan/
* Will disable your account on anyone's whim request regardless of no legal justification and then require you to jump through multi-week hoops to attempt to restore the site. https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/sorry-gas-companies-parody-isnt-infringement-even-if-it-creeps-you-out
