<span class="p-summary">The '''<dfn>NASCAR problem</dfn>''' is a reference to the jumble of branding icons on websites, e.g. 3rd party sign-in/login options or sharing buttons. It is dubbed the <em>NASCAR</em> problem because of these clusters of 3rd party icons/brands on websites resembles the collages of sponsorship decals covering [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR NASCAR] racing cars.</span> It's a <em>problem</em> because such clusters of icons/brands cause both visual noise and people to be confused (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory#Paradox_of_choice Paradox of choice]), overwhelmed or unlikely to remember individual icons, especially as the clusters seem to grow with the introduction of new 3rd party identity/profile/social sites and services.

The term was originally coined by [[Daniel Burka]] of Digg to describe the user interface for signing in to websites that support third-party authentication protocols like [[OpenID]].(date/time/source citation needed, from Chris Messina who made this assertion). Example of an OpenID sign-in UI with the NASCAR problem of a screen overwhelmed by brands:

Jeff Atwood appears to be first to have made the comparison between brand/icon links to 3rd party social sites and NASCAR in his 2006-05-11 blog post <cite>[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/excess-blog-flair.html Excess Blog Flair]</cite>.

Another more modern example of a NASCAR sign-in UI without OpenID:
