NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP were operating systems from Steve Jobsâ€™ NeXT company. NeXT and Apple merged in 1997 and [[macOS]] and [[iOS]] are based on OPENSTEP. 

Not to be confused with the OpenStep framework which was the object oriented technology from NeXT minus the operating system. OpenStep was ported to Solaris, Windows NT and the web (as WebObjects) between 1992 and 1996.
