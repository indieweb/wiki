'''A <dfn>[http://nownownow.com/about now page]</dfn>''' is a [[page]] that tells you what a person is focused on at this point in their life. 

== Why ==
The now page "movement" was initiated by [http://sivers.org/ Derek Sivers] in a sense to fill the gap between the common "About Page" and regular status updates on services like Twitter and Facebook.

<blockquote>It’s useful for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your site: because people on your site want to know more about you.

Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities. By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other requests.</blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has an automatically updated [https://aaronparecki.com/now/ now page] since 2017-04-27.

=== Max Dietrich ===
Max Dietrich added a [https://mxd.codes/now now page] on 2021-02-28.

=== Nowish Examples ===
These "now" examples are more like "recently" pages with information updated within the past month or so:
* {{colinwalker}} added a [https://colinwalker.blog/now now page] on 2017-05-10
* {{kimberlyhirsh}} has a [https://kimberlyhirsh.com/now now page].

=== Out of date examples ===
These "now" examples haven’t been updated for years:
* {{chrisaldrich}} has had a regularly updated [http://boffosocko.com/now/ now page] since 2016-06-13

== Services ==
=== nownownow ===
[https://nownownow.com/ nownownow] is a collection of sites with a /now page.

The main page at https://nownownow.com/about encourages people to practice several IndieWeb [[principles]] including own their own domain and post their own content.

Those who register their now page on the [https://nownownow.com/about Now site] and who have a Twitter account will receive [https://twitter.com/nownownow @mentions on Twitter] every few months in part as an advertisement for the service, but also as a reminder to the user to update their Now page.

== Criticism ==
=== Additional work ===
Much like side files, a static Now page (just like an [[about|about page]]) requires additional work to regularly update and therefore isn't very [[DRY]] (aka Don't Repeat Yourself).

<blockquote>One node of resistance pushing against my keeping a Now page is the felt emphasis on immediacy. Perhaps it’s more perception than reality, but Now feels different than Recently or Lately, which trace a bit longer arc of activity. I want to meld mindfulness & deliberation. --[https://micro.blog/schuth/920869 William Schuth on 2018-09-27]</blockquote>

=== Never updated ===
"now" pages feel like something a lot of people set up but never update


== Brainstorming ==
* {{JackyAlcine}} is considering tying integrations from his home automation setup to toggle a "Do Not Disturb" mode on his site. Things like an active [[watch]] post can be used to alert the site to a "Jacky's busy right now, please don't disturb" state.

* Dev tip: when displaying events that are happening "now", use the oldest possible value of "now", in UTC-12. If this is only for events you personally are attending, then use your own current timezone to determine "now".
