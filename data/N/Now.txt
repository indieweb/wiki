'''A <dfn>[http://nownownow.com/about now page]</dfn>''' is a page that tells you what a person is focused on at this point in their life. 

The now page "movement" was initiated by [http://sivers.org/ Derek Sivers] in a sense to fill the gap between the common "About Page" and regular status updates on services like Twitter and Facebook.

<blockquote>It’s useful for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your site: because people on your site want to know more about you.

Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities. By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other requests.</blockquote>

The main page at http://nownownow.com/about encourages people to practice several IndieWeb [[principles]] including own their own domain and post their own content.

Those who register their now page on the [http://nownownow.com/about Now site] and who have a Twitter account will receive [https://twitter.com/nownownow @mentions on Twitter] every few months in part as an advertisement for the service, but also as a reminder to the user to update their Now page.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} has had a regularly updated [http://boffosocko.com/now/ now page] since 2016-06-13
* {{aaronpk}} has an automatically updated [https://aaronparecki.com/now/ now page] since 2017-04-27
* {{colinwalker}} added a [https://colinwalker.blog/now now page] on 2017-05-10


== Criticism ==
Much like side files, a static Now page (just like an [[about|about page]]) requires additional work to regularly update and therefore isn't very [[DRY]] (aka Don't Repeat Yourself).

<blockquote>One node of resistance pushing against my keeping a Now page is the felt emphasis on immediacy. Perhaps it’s more perception than reality, but Now feels different than Recently or Lately, which trace a bit longer arc of activity. I want to meld mindfulness & deliberation. --[https://micro.blog/schuth/920869 William Schuth on 2018-09-27]</blockquote>
