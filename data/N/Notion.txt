'''<dfn>[https://www.notion.so/ Notion]</dfn>''' is a note-taking and multiple [[post]] drafting app that is apparently highly recommended for its clean user interface however lacks [[offline first]] support.

== Criticism ==
* fails at [[offline first]] note taking, drafting, editing use-cases: https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/1229640564401827840
** "I wanted to take some notes on the airplane so I pulled up Notion but it wouldn’t load because of lack of internet. This stuff kills me, it’s not acceptable" [http://jlongster.com @jlongster] February 18, 2020
* https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1268211212514242560 incorrect flagging of content as unsafe
** "@NotionHQ how do I request a review for a page that was flagged as unsafe? I have a list of the gear I use for streaming shared (https://www.notion.so/jlengstorf/My-Livestreaming-Setup-9268f4e8e7fa4388bec915777735ad82) but it's been flagged as unsafe — these aren't even affiliate links, so I'm not sure what tripped the algorithm?"
