{{stub}}

'''<dfn>noindex</dfn>''' is an instruction you can put in a page (meta tag or HTTP header) to designate a specific URL on your domain that you do not want robots to index.

== How to ==
Add this meta tag to the page:

<code><meta name="robots" content="noindex"></code>

An important note from Google:
<blockquote>Important: For the noindex rule to be effective, the page or resource must not be blocked by a robots.txt file, and it has to be otherwise accessible to the crawler. If the page is blocked by a robots.txt file or the crawler can't access the page, the crawler will never see the noindex rule, and the page can still appear in search results, for example if other pages link to it.
</blockquote>
