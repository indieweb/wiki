** "I'm pretty excited! Today I rolled out "Play posts" on my website. After watching traffic between the Nintendo Switch Parental App on iOS, I was able to utilize the API calls to write a script that runs periodically and creates Play posts on my website with the information about what I played and how long I played it."
