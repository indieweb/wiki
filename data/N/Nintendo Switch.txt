'''<dfn>Nintendo Switch</dfn>''' is a gaming console by Nintendo. Some people track their [[game play]] on the machine on their own websites.

{{cleverdevil}} wrote a [[Python]] script using Nintendo's API: https://github.com/cleverdevil/switchpub

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle}} set up a script using Nintendo's API calls to make "Play" posts:

<blockquote>
"I'm pretty excited! Today I rolled out "Play posts" on my website. After watching traffic between the Nintendo Switch Parental App on iOS, I was able to utilize the API calls to write a script that runs periodically and creates Play posts on my website with the information about what I played and how long I played it."

{{gRegor}} listed my Switch Friend Code on my [[contact]] page starting some time in early 2020. In 2023, when I set up my [https://gregorlove.com/follow/ How to Follow Me] page, I moved it there. It was in plain text since Nintendo did not seem to offer a profile to link to.

2024-09-08: From [https://chat.indieweb.org/2024-09-08#t1725832347957700 chat] I learned that it is possible to link to your Friend Code, which opens a page that prompts you to open the Nintendo Switch mobile app to continue adding the friend. I updated https://gregorlove.com/follow/#switch with this link and included [[rel-me]] on it.
* To generate this link: open the Nintendo Switch Online app, select your avatar at the top right. Then next to where it displays your friend code, click the three dots and select "Copy as URL"
* The format of this link currently appears to be: <nowiki>https://lounge.nintendo.com/friendcode/[friend_code]/[random_hash]</nowiki>. The link does not work without the random hash, so it appears you need to generate the link from within the mobile app.

'''Animal Crossing: New Horizons IndieWebCamp Shirt'''

2020-04-30: I set up an IWC logo t-shirt in Animal Crossing and added it to the public designs so you can download it in the game: https://gregorlove.com/2020/04/represent-the-indieweb/
* "Represent the #indieweb on your Animal Crossing island! To get your own, access the kiosk in the Able Sisters store and search for Design ID MO-5MDH-M0LJ-3MX1.<br><br>Also, if you want to visit my island, add me as a Switch friend." April 30, 2020
