== History ==
It was started in 2006 by Eden Kennedy "as kind of a joke because I'd failed at [[NaNoWriMo]] the previous year". [http://open.salon.com/blog/wqbelle/2011/01/23/nablopomo_national_blog_posting_month] In 2010, NaBloPoMo was sold to Blogher.com. Blogher continued to run NaBloPoMo, expanding the challenge to every month of the year until around 2017.

The BlogHer site no longer contains any mention about NaBloPoMo and the [http://www.blogher.com/blogher-topics/blogging-social-media/nablopomo former link] for it redirects to the homepage. Many people still participate using Twitter hashtag [https://twitter.com/search?q=nablopomo&src=typed_query #NaBloPoMo].
