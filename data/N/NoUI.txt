{{stub}}

'''<dfn>NoUI</dfn>''' is the absence of need for a user interface, with automated actions or derived fields. You may setup computed fields which save users input. Perhaps if they are logged in using IndieAuth, the username field or email is pre-populated. Unless control is necessary avoiding the cognitive load to design and present it is best spent on making it not needed.
