'''<dfn>Next.js</dfn>''' is a JavaScript framework developed by Vercel and a community of open-source contributors that may be used to develop a personal website.

== Why ==

Here are a few reasons why you might want to use Next.js for your personal website:

* Next.js is fast
* Next.js is in active development and is improving in terms of performance, speed, and functionality with every update
* Next.js is open-source
* There is an extensive library of Next.js content on the internet
* Next.js scales well to large numbers of pages

== Why Not ==

Next.js is an abstract framework. It may not be suited to everyone's tastes, especially those who prefer to err away from JavaScript for the foundations of a web application.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{capjamesg}} used to use Next.js for his personal website.
* [[User:mxd.codes|Max Dietrich ]] uses Next.js for his personal website. Max supports receiving and displaying webmentions on his Next.js site.
