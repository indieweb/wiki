'''<dfn>[http://netnewswireapp.com/ NetNewsWire]</dfn>''' is an open source [[feed reader]] app for MacOS.

== History ==
Brent Simmons originally developed NetNewsWire. It was later acquired by NewsGator, then Black Pixel. On 2017-06-01, Brent announced he was working on an open source feed reader, '''<dfn>Evergreen</dfn>'''. [http://inessential.com/2017/06/01/evergreen_diary_1_open_source]

On 2018-08-31, Black Pixel announced they could no longer maintain NetNewsWire and were returning it to Brent Simmons. [https://medium.com/bpxl-craft/the-future-of-netnewswire-8fc999387a8a] Brent said that Evergreen 1.0 would be renamed NetNewsWire 5.0 and would remain open source. [http://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home] The github repository was renamed accordingly.

== IndieWeb Requests ==
=== h-feed support ===
There was a github issue to add [[h-feed]] support: https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen/issues/293
* Brent Simmons [http://inessential.com/2018/01/25/evergreen_diary_9_on_indieweb indicated] he would be adding support for h-feed in the 1.0 Alpha version, but subsequently apparently closed the issue in 2023 without changes.
