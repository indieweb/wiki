'''<dfn>[https://nextcloud.com/ Nextcloud]</dfn>''' is an open source software [[project]] for self-hosted personal web services including a file manager (an indie version of [[Dropbox]]), music, calendar (CalDAV), contacts (CardDAV), and more. It was forked from [[ownCloud]] in early June 2016.

[https://youtu.be/iMfokaX2r8g Video discussion and reasons for the fork]. 


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{cweiske}} uses Nextcloud for file sharing, contact, calendar and note synchronization
* {{klez}} uses Nextcloud with Collabora plugin to keep a spreadsheet to handle home finances with his housemates
* {{kisik21}} uses Nextcloud for contact, calendar, sticky notes and file synchronization.
* {{JackyAlcine}} uses it for all of their hosted DAV needs (files, notes, tasks, calendar, etc).
* {{aaronpk}} uses Nextcloud for file syncing, sharing, contacts synced with iOS, and private notes
* {{tonz}} uses NextCloud on a VPS as Dropbox replacement
* {{kvibber}} uses Nextcloud for file syncing, contact, calendar, [[feed reader]] and notes.

== Applications ==
Nextcloud functionality can be added through applications.

=== Nextcloud News ===
[https://github.com/nextcloud/news Nextcloud News] provides an [[RSS]] aggregator and [[feed reader]]. It offers a RESTful API for app developers. Available in the Nextcloud App Store: https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/news.

* Might be worth looking into adding mf2 h-feed support to Nextcloud News — assess how much work would it take, would the maintainers support it etc. —{{barnabywalters}}

=== Nextcloud Tasks ===
[https://github.com/nextcloud/tasks Nextcloud Tasks] provides task tracking and management, and syncs with popular desktop and mobile task management applications like [[2Do]].
