'''<dfn>Whim</dfn>''' is a command-line program and Unix daemon for sending, receiving, managing, and displaying [[webmentions]]. It was created and is maintained by {{jmac}}, and first released in the summer of 2020.

It intends to serve as a "one-stop shop" for one's Webmention use, providing:

* A self-hosted endpoint for webmention receipt and verification
* A command-line interface for seeing summaries of stored webmentions, and managing a block-list
* A simple web server for displaying verified webmentions for a given URL, based on default or user-defined templates
* A command-line interface for sending webmentions, either at a single target, or to all valid targets from a given source

Whim's homepage is at https://jmac.org/whim/. It is free and open-source software, with [https://github.com/jmacdotorg/whim/ a public GitHub repository].

== IndieWeb examples ==

* {{jmac}} uses Whim as the Webmention endpoint for both [https://jmac.org jmac.org] and [https://fogknife.com fogknife.com], as of mid-2020. Whim also displays webmentions for both domains, e.g. [https://jmac.org/whim#wm-comments at the bottom of Whim's own homepage].
