You like the web and decentralization? '''You are invited!''' Bring the URL of your personal website, or start creating one right at the party!

Locations and times:

* Homebrew Website Club at Mozilla San Francisco, Wednesday, January 24, 2018, starts at 6:30pm

(Add your location here)

Reason for the party:

* The originally decentralized internet has become more and more centralized in recent years: Facebook, Twitter, etc.
* A community of technologists has been building a decentralized alternative, called the Indie Web, by connecting their own personal websites using decentralized protocols instead of the big silos
* Thousands of sites are already participating in the Indie Web
* One of the key technologies is Web Mention, which lets your personal website notify somebody else's website that you have written about a post on their site
* By the time of the party, more than 1 million web mentions will have been sent over the internet. If that isn't a reason for a party, what is?
* It proves that a community of committed individuals can buck the supposedly unstoppable trends of centralization and make the web work for them they want it to work: decentralized, user controlled, with no third parties in the middle
* Onward to indiewebify the rest of the web!
