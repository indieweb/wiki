== Reason for the party ==

* The originally decentralized internet has become more and more centralized in recent years: Facebook, Twitter, etc.
* A community of technologists has been building a decentralized alternative, called the [[IndieWeb]], by connecting their own personal websites using simple, decentralized protocols instead of big corporately owned walled gardens
* Thousands of sites are already participating in the IndieWeb
* One of the key technologies is [[Webmention]], which lets your personal website notify somebody else's website that you have written about a post on their site--think of it like @mentions, but ones that work across website borders instead of being stuck within a single service.
* By the time of the party, more than 1 million Webmentions will have been sent over the internet. If that isn't a reason for a party, what is?
* It proves that a community of committed individuals using simple web standards can buck the supposedly unstoppable trends of centralization and make the web work for them they want it to work: decentralized, user controlled, with no third parties in the middle
* Onward to indiewebify the rest of the web!
