'''<dfn>[https://js.wiki/ Wiki.js]</dfn>''' is an extensible [[open source]] server [[wiki-project]] written in [[JavaScript]].


== Features ==

Some advantages of wiki.js, especially in comparison with [[MediaWiki]], include:

* More visually pleasing, modern interface - uses material icons and user interface
* More modern development and hosting platform - based on javascript ([[Node.js]])
* Better access control, privacy options
* sync pages with a git repository
* better search functionality built-in
* better, simpler documentation
* rapid development - a beta [https://blog.js.wiki/news?tag=3.x version 3 of wiki.js] is due summer 2021 with several new features

== Limitations ==

* No support for backlinks
* Multlingual / translation support not as good as mediawiki’s
* There have been some security issues
* Harder to install correctly, can't use shared hosting
* No 3rd party managed hosting options
* No email notifications
* Have to create separate url path for each page, no spaces, etc.
** Seems like this could automatically be done, like in wordpress, mediawiki
* No easy link curation - paste in a link or reference and have it automatically load a title and potentially other information, like wordpress, wallabag, other options have
* No structured data? - page properties, metadata, content types
* No page redirects, aliases, synonyms
* Can’t edit tag/category pages or use pages as homes for tags/categories
* No schema.org support
* No SEO enhancements
* Not clear on caching, performance enhancements - several complain it’s slower than mediawiki
* Site appears to not work if javascript is disabled
* No section, block editing / linking
* Can’t see recent changes
* No RSS/Atom feeds
* Not as much rich multimedia / embedding support - although raw HTML input is available
* WYSIWYG and markdown editors aren’t easily interchangeable - you have to pick one. It would be nice if the WYSIWYG editor saved in markdown format, like some third party open source editors do.
* No double bracket wiki linking
* No minor changes, change summaries
* Not clear on spam, abuse blocking
* No concurrent editing, conflict handling - although version 3 will apparently support this
* No option to host as a static site
