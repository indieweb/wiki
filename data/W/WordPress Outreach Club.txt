Note: As of July 29, 2018 he is using SemPress for his theme, has a category called 'microblog' and a Friendica node and appears to be actively IndieWeb.

<blockquote>Not sure why, but @indiewebcamp theme/plugins in Wordpress don't seem to be giving me 2-way comments...was working before.</blockquote>

Not sure when fixed, but appears to be working again as of Nov 2016

Unsure if success as David Peach switched away from WordPress for his site.
