:Being not far from DC, I would be very interested in an IndieWebCamp DC. I don't know that I would be much use as an [[#Organizers|organizer]] though, but if there's enough interest maybe we can figure something out.  [[User:Rascul.io|Rascul.io]] 12:23, 14 October 2014 (PDT)

:Jim Groom and I are happy to help organize this. We'll be working closely with [http://apievangelist.com Kin Lane] on this to try to get some folks from the gov sector who are working with open data to be a part of it. [[User:Timowens.io|Timowens.io]] 08:26, 5 December 2014 (PST)
