'''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/ Webmention]</dfn>''' is a web standard for mentions and conversations across the web, a powerful building block that is used for a growing [[federated]] network of [[comment]]s, [[like]]s, [[repost]]s, and other rich interactions across the decentralized social web.

<blockquote>”… an @ mention that works across websites; so that you don't feel immovable from Twitter or Fb.” <cite class="h-cite">— [https://twitter.com/rngala/status/852354426983591937 <span class="p-author">Rony Ngala</span>]</cite></blockquote>

When you link to a website, you can send it a Webmention to notify it. If it supports Webmentions, then that website may display your post as a [[comment]], [[like]], or other [[response]], and presto, you’re having a conversation from one site to another!

: If you want to meet some in person, we’d welcome you to join one of our virtual meetups coming up: https://events.indieweb.org/.
: Some users maintain lists:
: * {{chrisaldrich}} keeps a list of people who have IndieWeb sites and most (though not all) will support Webmentions: https://boffosocko.com/about/following/ Most under the IndieWeb and some under the IndieWeb for Education and Blogger headings will support webmentions.

; Question : How do I indicate to other sites that I support Webmention?
; Answers
: If you’d like, you can add a Webmention [[button]] to your site to visually indicate that you support it.
: Some will indicate at the bottom of posts that they support Webmention. 
: Some will provide an input box (in their comment section, on a custom page, or both) for others to submit a URL that mentions their post. This is particularly useful for those who would like to reply, but don't have a way of automatically sending a Webmention.
