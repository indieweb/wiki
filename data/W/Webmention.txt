<span style="margin-top: -2em; background:white; float:right;">[[File:webmention-logo.svg|160px]]</span>

'''<dfn>[https://webmention.net/draft/ Webmention]</dfn>''' is a web standard for mentions and conversations across the web, a powerful building block that is used for a growing [[federated]] network of [[comment]]s, [[like]]s, [[repost]]s, and other rich interactions across the decentralized social web.

<blockquote>”… an @ mention that works across websites; so that you don't feel immovable from Twitter or Fb.” <cite class="h-cite">— [https://twitter.com/rngala/status/852354426983591937 <span class="p-author">Rony Ngala</span>]</cite></blockquote>

When you link to a website, you can send it a Webmention to notify it. If it supports Webmentions, then that website may display your post as a [[comment]], [[like]], or other [[response]], and presto, you’re having a conversation from one site to another!
