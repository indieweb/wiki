'''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/ Webmention]</dfn>''' is a web standard for conversations and interactions across the web, a powerful building block used for a growing distributed network of peer-to-peer [[comment]]s, [[like]]s, [[repost]]s, and other [[responses]] across the web.

<blockquote>”… an @ mention that works across websites; so that you don't feel immovable from Twitter or Fb.” <cite class="h-cite">— [https://twitter.com/rngala/status/852354426983591937 <span class="p-author">Rony Ngala</span>]</cite></blockquote>

== Why ==
'''Enables cross-site conversations'''. When you link to a website, you can send it a Webmention to notify it. If it supports Webmentions, then that website may display your post as a [[comment]], [[like]], or other [[response]], and presto, you’re having a conversation from one site to another!

== How to implement or display ==
When you publish a post with links to other sites, your site should send webmention notifications to sites that accept them.

A webmention receiver provides discovery of their webmention endpoint. When a receiver’s endpoint receives a webmention notification, it looks up the sender’s post and may display it as a response. 

Mentions require a link to the recipient, and can be enhanced into more meaningful [[responses]] (such as [[comments]], [[reposts]], or [[likes]]) by adding [[microformats]] to the sender’s post.
