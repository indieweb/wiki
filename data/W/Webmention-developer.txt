This page documents technical details of [[Webmention]], specifically for '''<dfn>Webmention developers</dfn>''' so they can support cross-site [[comments]] and other [[responses]] in their code, or on their site or service.

Webmention is a [https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-webmention-20170112/ W3C Recommendation] that supersedes [[Pingback]], using only HTTP and x-www-form-urlencoded content rather than [[XML-RPC]], with additional functionality (e.g. updates & deletes) as well as greater security & robustness from years of experience with prior iterations.

== Get Started Developers ==
If you already have some idea of what Webmention is and are ready to implement, work your way through:
* https://webmention.rocks/ - Webmention test suite!
Then: '''Submit an implementation report for Webmention to help document the growing interoperable decentralized webmention network!'''
* Instructions: https://github.com/w3c/webmention/tree/master/implementation-reports

== Overview ==
__TOC__
A typical Webmention flow is as follows:

# Alice posts some interesting content on her site (which is set up to receive webmentions).
# Bob sees this content and comments about it on his site, linking back to Alice's original post.
# Using Webmention, Bob's publishing software automatically notifies Alice's server that her post has been linked to by the URL of Bob's post.
# Alice's publishing software verifies that Bob's post actually contains a link to her post and then includes information about Bob's post on her site, for example, displaying it as a comment.

== Protocol Summary ==
{{main|webmention-spec}}

If Aaron's blog supports receiving webmentions, and Barnaby's blog supports sending webmentions, then this is how they interact:

# User Aaron posts a blog post on his blog
# User Barnaby writes post on his blog that links to Aaron's post.
# After publishing the post (i.e. it has a URL), Barnaby's server notices this link as part of the publishing process
# Barnaby's server does webmention discovery on Aaron's post to find its webmention endpoint (if not found, process stops)
# Barnaby's server sends a webmention to Aaron's post's webmention endpoint with 
#* <code>source</code> set to Barnaby's post's permalink
#* <code>target</code> set to Aaron's post's permalink.
# Aaron's server receives the webmention
# Aaron's server verifies that <code>target</code> in the webmention is a valid permalink on Aaron's blog (if not, processing stops)
# Aaron's server verifies that the <code>source</code> (when retrieved, after following redirects) in the webmention contains a hyperlink to the <code>target</code> (if not, processing stops)

Unmentioned but implied (and vaguely mentioned in the pingback spec):

* Aaron's server displays the information about Barnaby's post somewhere on Aaron's post.
* If a <code>u-url</code> is present at the <code>source</code>, then the receiver could display that URL, and default to showing the <code>source</code> otherwise. This allows services like [[Bridgy]] to render the original tweet URL in the <code>u-url</code> property so receivers will link to the tweet instead of the Bridgy proxy page.

See [[comment#Accept_a_comment|comment: how to accept a comment]] for more details on accepting comments in general and displaying them.

== How to ==
=== How to implement sending ===
(stub)

Every time you:
* create a post, send Webmentions to every link in the post
* [[update]] a post, send Webmentions to every link in the post before the update and after the update
* [[delete]] a post, send Webmentions to every link that was in the post

To send a Webmention to a link:
* do Webmention endpoint discovery on that link
* send a Webmention using the endpoint, source= your page with the link, target= the link

=== How to implement receiving ===
(stub)
* set up a Webmention endpoint to receive them for you
* add Webmention endpoint discovery link to your post [[permalink]]s and any other pages you wish to receive webmentions for, like your [[homepage]]
* validate and process received Webmentions for what type it is (like a [[reply]], [[like]], [[repost]], or other [[response]]), and whether it is new, an update, or a notification of deletion.
* display received [[comments]], [[likes]], [[reposts]], and other [[responses]]

=== How to test ===
(stub)
* [https://webmention.rocks/ Webmention.rocks]

=== How to send webmentions with cURL ===
Manually sending a webmention with [[cURL]] can be the quickest way for developers to test webmentions.

When your ''source'' URL links to a ''target'' URL:

# Find the ''target'''s webmention ''endpoint''. This may be in the HTML or in an HTTP Link header, with <code>rel=webmention</code>
# Using the ''source'', ''target'', and ''endpoint'' URLs, enter at the command line:<br> <code>curl -i -d source=''source'' -d target=''target'' ''endpoint''</code>

== Implementations ==
=== IndieWeb Examples ===

The following users/sites have live <span id="IndieWeb_implementations">implementations</span> for sending and or receiving webmentions, listed in rough chronological order of when they did so.

For past implementations that are no longer live, see '''[[#Previous_Examples|Previous Examples]]'''.

If you add Webmention sending or receiving to your site, add yourself in a new section at the bottom of this list and link to your site, implementation(s), and permalinks of your webmention receiving/sending posts. Try to include a screenshot that shows that too.
