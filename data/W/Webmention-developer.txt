This page documents technical details of [[Webmention]], specifically for '''<dfn>Webmention developers</dfn>''' so they can support cross-site [[comments]] and other [[responses]] in their code, or on their site or service.

Webmention is a [https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/ W3C Recommendation] that supersedes [[Pingback]], using  a simple HTTP POST request and x-www-form-urlencoded content rather than [[XML-RPC]], with additional functionality (e.g. updates & deletes) as well as greater security & robustness from years of experience with prior iterations.

== Get Started Developers ==
If you already have some idea of what Webmention is and are ready to implement, work your way through:
* https://webmention.rocks/ - Webmention test suite!
Then: '''Submit an implementation report for Webmention to help document the growing interoperable decentralized webmention network!'''
* Instructions: https://github.com/w3c/webmention/tree/master/implementation-reports

== Overview ==
__TOC__
A typical Webmention flow is as follows:

# Alice posts some interesting content on her site (which is set up to receive webmentions).
# Bob sees this content and comments about it on his site, linking back to Alice's original post.
# Using Webmention, Bob's publishing software automatically notifies Alice's server that her post has been linked to by the URL of Bob's post.
# Alice's publishing software verifies that Bob's post actually contains a link to her post and then includes information about Bob's post on her site, for example, displaying it as a comment.

== Protocol Summary ==
[https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/ Specification]

If Aaron's blog supports receiving webmentions, and Barnaby's blog supports sending webmentions, then this is how they interact:

# User Aaron posts a blog post on his blog
# User Barnaby writes post on his blog that links to Aaron's post.
# After publishing the post (i.e. it has a URL), Barnaby's server notices this link as part of the publishing process
# Barnaby's server does webmention discovery on Aaron's post to find its webmention endpoint (if not found, process stops)
# Barnaby's server sends an HTTP POST request to Aaron's post's webmention endpoint with two parameters:
#* <code>source</code> set to Barnaby's post's permalink
#* <code>target</code> set to Aaron's post's permalink.
# Aaron's server receives the webmention
# Aaron's server verifies that <code>target</code> in the webmention is a valid permalink on Aaron's blog (if not, processing stops)
# Aaron's server verifies that the <code>source</code> (when retrieved, after following redirects) in the webmention contains a hyperlink to the <code>target</code> (if not, processing stops)

What to do with the webmention once processed is unmentioned in the spec but implied (and vaguely mentioned in the pingback spec). Aaron's server can display the information about Barnaby's post somewhere on Aaron's post. 

The most popular display is to display Barnaby's post as a comment, however, how to display can vary based on what Barnaby posted, or Aaron's preferences for display. For more:
* See [[responses#Displaying_responses_to_a_post|responses: displaying responses]]
* See [[comments#How_to_display|comment: how to display]]

== How to ==
=== How to implement sending ===

Every time you:
* create a post, send Webmentions to every link in the post
* [[update]] a post, send Webmentions to every link in the post before the update and after the update
* [[delete]] a post, send Webmentions to every link that was in the post

To send a Webmention to a link:
* do Webmention endpoint discovery on that link
* send a Webmention using the endpoint, source= your page with the link, target= the link

=== How to implement receiving ===
(stub)
* set up a Webmention endpoint to receive them for you
* add Webmention endpoint discovery link to your post [[permalink]]s and any other pages you wish to receive webmentions for, like your [[homepage]]
* validate and process received Webmentions for what type it is (like a [[reply]], [[like]], [[repost]], or other [[response]]), and whether it is new, an update, or a notification of deletion.
* display received [[comments]], [[likes]], [[reposts]], and other [[responses]]

=== How to test ===
(stub)
* [https://webmention.rocks/ Webmention.rocks]
* [https://gist.github.com/epilys/5cefed33f5b720eb532f36168aad3c70 webmention_server.py dummy http server for local testing - both receives and sends webmentions]
** Useful for local webmention testing

=== How to send webmentions with cURL ===
Manually sending a webmention with [[cURL]] can be the quickest way for developers to test webmentions.

When your ''source'' URL links to a ''target'' URL:

# Find the ''target'''s webmention ''endpoint''. This may be in the HTML or in an HTTP Link header, with <code>rel=webmention</code>
# Using the ''source'', ''target'', and ''endpoint'' URLs, enter at the command line:<br> <code>curl -i -d source=''source'' -d target=''target'' ''endpoint''</code>

== Page To Do ==
Edits / improvements for this page in particular:
* Simplify this page for web developers
** simplify prose
* Re-order content as needed to to
*# motivate web developers first
*# provide the simplest, easiest thing to implement first
*# then the next simplest/easiest but still useful, etc.
* provide illustrative diagrams for protocol overview, how tos
* perhaps write up a developer-centric [[#Why]] section
* figure out how to integrate this with [[IndieMark]]

Edits to [[Webmention]]:
* keep analyzing, asking, doing:
*# How can the [[Webmention]] page be simplified to quickly:
*## make sense to [[generations]] 1-3
*## motivate [[generations]] 1-3 that they want Webmentions on their site(s)
*# Add clear instructions for enabling Webmentions with full POSSE/backfeed support with the goal of all responses to your content on social media goes back to your site, whether it uses:
*## [[Known]]
*## [[WordPress]] (depends on simpler plugin strategy? like just one instead of two)
*# Provide inspirational screenshots / diagrams of Webmention potential, e.g.
*#* [[marginalia]]
