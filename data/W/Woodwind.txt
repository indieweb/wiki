'''<dfn>Woodwind</dfn>''' is a minimalist open source indie [[reader]] by {{kylewm}}. 
* There was an instance running at <nowiki>https://woodwind.xyz/</nowiki> (offline since 2018-02-06, domain abanded)

* Source code is [https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind on GitHub] 

== Features ==
* Support for [[h-feed]] and xml feeds
* Login with [[IndieAuth]]
* Post responses (likes, replies etc.) via different configurable mechanisms:
** [[Micropub]]: likes and replies are posted directly to the user's site with minimal clicking.
** [[indie-config]]: supply indie-actions for each entry, use javascript to configure the endpoints using web+action handler.
** Configurable action URLs: configure actions and action urls in the user settings page. This is like indie-config but the configuration is stored in Woodwind instead of your web+action handler.
* Stream-style, avoid feeling like checking [[email]] (constantly marking things as read and unread).
* Low maintenance. I'm trying to keep the core code under ~500 lines, moving reusable pieces to libraries or flask extensions (e.g., https://github.com/kylewm/flask-micropub)
** Well I still think this was a noble goal but I blew past it. LOC is closer to 1000 now.
* Reply context for in-reply-tos h-entrys and tweets (via twitter-activitystreams and a special Twitter user @woodwind_reader that doesn't have access to anyone's private feeds)
* Embed instagram photos, youtube, and vimeo content when text includes a link and no other embedded content.
* Supports subscribing to [[Pubsubhubbub]] feeds (h-feed and xml) 
* Websockets-based live updates using a Node.js proxy almost exactly copied from http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2013/10/13/1/realtime-indieweb-comments, thanks for documenting {{aaronpk}}!!
** Probably need to improve the UI to hide updates behind a "# new posts" link like twitter.

==Configuration for [[Known]]==
Those who'd like to quickly set up the Configurable Action URLs for use with Known can cut/paste the following:
*Share http://www.yoursitenamehere.com/share?share_url={url}&share_title=&share_type=note
*Reply http://www.yoursitenamehere.com/share?share_url={url}&share_title=&share_type=reply
*Bookmark http://www.yoursitenamehere.com/share?share_url={url}&share_title=&share_type=bookmark
*Like http://www.yoursitenamehere.com/share?share_url={url}&share_title=&share_type=like
*Repost http://www.yoursitenamehere.com/share?share_url={url}&share_title=&share_type=repost

One need only to replace `www.yoursitenamehere.com` with their appropriate site URL.

Note that for using the "like" and "repost" functionality, one will need the [https://github.com/kylewm/KnownReactions KnownReactions plugin] and that without it, these buttons won't function properly on your installation.

== Itches ==
* Feeds that are successfully subscribed via PuSH and have received at least one update ping should be polled at a lower rate, 1x/day probably.
* Show "liked" status if a post has been previously liked 
** remember successful likes posted through woodwind, and poll the user's unfiltered h-feed to pick up the rest
** alternative proposal: parse p-like on the target permalink. (This would not be good enough for the feeds I subscribe to... legacy xml feeds, proxied twitter stream, sites that do not publish comments like tantek.com, sites that pull in comments from an external service via javascript)
* Support "unlike" a status that has been previously liked
* Aggregate posts by the same author within some temporal window (probably by day)
* Cluster simple posts (e.g. "like" posts on tantek.com)
* Quick access to {facebook,twitter,instagram}-activitystreams.appspot.com to make it easy to subscribe to social network feeds.

== Name ==
A bad pun... woodwinds are "reed" instruments.
