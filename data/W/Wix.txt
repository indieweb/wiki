'''<dfn>Wix</dfn>''' is a point-and-click website creation service that does not support exporting, which makes [[migration]] difficult, and is thus not recommended for [[hosting]] your IndieWeb site. Per https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2019/04/22/dangerousmere-for-everyone-who-is-replying-to and https://support.wix.com/en/article/exporting-or-embedding-your-wix-site-elsewhere.
