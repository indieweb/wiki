'''<dfn>[https://wix.com Wix]</dfn>''' is a point-and-click website creation service that [[#No_export|does not allow exporting your content]], so is not recommended for hosting your IndieWeb site.

== Criticism ==
=== No export ===
Wix does not support exporting, which makes [[migration]] difficult, and is thus not recommended for [[hosting]] your IndieWeb site.

** Wix absolutely does not help anyone do anything but give them money. They don't expose standards; they have been litigated against for violating OpenSource license of WordPress - 2020-02-20 [[User:Www.lewiscowles.co.uk|Lewis Cowles]]
