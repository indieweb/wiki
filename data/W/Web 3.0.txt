'''<dfn>Web 3.0</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>#web3</dfn>) is a phrase used to pitch visionary sequels to the popularity of "[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 Web 2.0]" to advocate for particular [[plumbing]] solutions looking for problems, starting with the "[[Semantic Web]]" in the late 2000s, [[decentralization]] in the 2010s, and now mostly [[blockchain]]s & cryptocurrencies; the [[IndieWeb]] instead focuses directly on user-centric [[principles|goals]], with technologies only as a means.


== Web 3.0 as Semantic Web ==
The first occurrences of "Web 3.0", occurred during the rise of "Web 2.0" in the mid-2000s, as early as May of 2006, e.g <abbr title="New York Times">NYT</abbr>: [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/technology/23iht-web.html A 'more revolutionary' Web]
<blockquote>Just when the ideas behind "Web 2.0" are starting to enter into the mainstream, the mass of brains behind the World Wide Web is introducing pieces of what may end up being called Web 3.0.</blockquote>

as [[SVG]] + Web 2.0 + "[[Semantic Web]]": <blockquote>"… asking what Web 3.0 is," Berners-Lee said. "… maybe when you've got an overlay of scalable vector graphics […] on Web 2.0 and access to a semantic Web integrated across a huge space of data …"</blockquote>
Later in 2007 it was documented as equivalent to "Semantic Web" on various roadmaps, graphs, and articles e.g.:

** "Yup, this about sums it up. A lot of centralization (re: tech billionaires) exists because "it's easier, and people want it."<br><br>That doesn't mean that it's necessary or desirable.<br><br>However, in its current instantiation, most of decentralization a la "web3" is just grift & greed."
