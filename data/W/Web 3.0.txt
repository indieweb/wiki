'''<dfn>Web 3.0</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>#web3</dfn>) is a phrase used to pitch visionary sequels to the popularity of "[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 Web 2.0]" to advocate for particular [[plumbing]] solutions looking for problems, starting with the "[[Semantic Web]]" in the late 2000s, [[decentralization]] in the 2010s, and now mostly [[blockchain]]s & cryptocurrencies; the [[IndieWeb]] instead focuses directly on user-centric [[principles|goals]], with technologies only as a means.

== Web 3.0 as Semantic Web ==
The first occurrences of "Web 3.0", occurred during the rise of "Web 2.0" in the mid-2000s, as early as May of 2006, e.g <abbr title="New York Times">NYT</abbr>: [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/technology/23iht-web.html A 'more revolutionary' Web]
<blockquote>Just when the ideas behind "Web 2.0" are starting to enter into the mainstream, the mass of brains behind the World Wide Web is introducing pieces of what may end up being called Web 3.0.</blockquote> 
<img src="https://novaspivack.typepad.com/RadarNetworksTowardsAWebOS.jpg" alt="A conceptual graph of evolution of Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, Web 4.0 along a diagonal with a horizontal time axis, with keywords and technologies sprinkled at each point along the diagonal" style="max-width:66%; float:right" />
as [[SVG]] + Web 2.0 + "[[Semantic Web]]": <blockquote>"… asking what Web 3.0 is," Berners-Lee said. "… maybe when you've got an overlay of scalable vector graphics […] on Web 2.0 and access to a semantic Web integrated across a huge space of data …"</blockquote>
Later in 2007 it was documented as equivalent to "Semantic Web" on various roadmaps, graphs, and articles e.g.:

** "Web 3.0, in my opinion is best defined as the third-decade of the Web (2010 - 2020), during which time several key technologies will become widely used. Chief among them will be RDF and the technologies of the emerging Semantic Web"

== Web 3.0 as Decentralization ==
* https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b
** "Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machines are able to interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer-to-peer networks without the need for third parties."
* https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/web-3-0-definition-open-internet-decentralized
** "Web 3.0’s semantic web will be enabled by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) software capable of decrypting natural language and understanding user intention"

** "Sign of our times: web3 used to be used to describe a decentralized, semantic web, where power was retaken by the final user: power on privacy, power on ownership<br>Now it is a flag put on top of ponzi pyramids whose main observable effect are to ruin people, taldnrs and our planet" [https://medium.com/@fanf42/ @fanf42] September 30, 2021

== Comparison to IndieWeb ==

** "When most people think of decentralizing the Internet, what they really want is to kill Facebook. Honestly, that’s a future I can get behind. #web3 is just the #indieweb." [https://steedgood.com @stephenjbell] October 8, 2021

* https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1460261336169041920
** "Right, but Web 2.0 (although the term was a bit of a joke to developers) was describing technologies solving actual problems. Web3 is vague hype.<br><br>Folks like https://indieweb.org/ share some of the web3 goals, but without the speculative crypto bro stuff."

** "Web 3.0 belongs to the community of the #Indieweb, not to the blockchain addicts who think that their way is the highway. If anybody wants to kill me for saying that, go right ahead, I’ll just rise, along with my fellows, once more. LOL" [https://cambridgeport90.org @Cambridgeport90] December 3, 2021

** "Yup, this about sums it up. A lot of centralization (re: tech billionaires) exists because "it's easier, and people want it."<br>That doesn't mean that it's necessary or desirable.<br>However, in its current instantiation, most of decentralization a la "web3" is just grift & greed."

** "The term web2 wasn't coined by charlatans cooking up planet-destroying algorithms while pushing crypto pyramid schemes and selling worthless signed pointers to things. Web3 proponents are ridiculed because there is plenty of reason to do so, not because people have changed." [https://twitter.com/mortenmertner @mortenmertner] September 30, 2021

** "imo, treat web3, metaverse, blockchain, etc as radioactive.  don't validate this crap.  they're trying to get rich, not solve real problems<br><br>just makes me sad that there's so little interest in a real decentralized web, because (by design) corps couldn't profit off of it" [https://eev.ee/ @eevee] November 14, 2021

=== Repeating past mistakes ===

** "My thought on the web3 discussion: there is absolutely something interesting with a lot of positive potential there, but if you buy into a bunch of Techno Utopian ideology that blinds you to the fact that power dynamics exist everywhere, you’re simply repeating past mistakes."

=== Fragile ===
* Criticism thread: https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1448009365173125123
** "There are three non-fraud foundational problems with "web3":<br><br>1. No way to reference anything in the real world (oracle problem)<br>2. Immutable code makes any smart contract its own bug bounty.<br>3. Everything breaks (more) unless expensive distributed systems are run in perpetuity." [http://pinboard.in @Pinboard] October 12, 2021

=== Not actually decentralization ===
* 2021-10-19 [https://soatok.blog/2021/10/19/against-web3-and-faux-decentralization/ Against Web3 and Faux-Decentralization] / Despite the hype, Web3 offers fake decentralization and builds upon technology you could build without cryptocurrency.

=== Complex slow expensive and unwanted by users ===
* Criticism of web3 as "blockchain": 2021-10-04 [https://thenewstack.io/web3-architecture-and-how-it-compares-to-traditional-web-apps/ Web3 Architecture and How It Compares to Traditional Web Apps] <blockquote>… the reality is, there are considerable challenges with blockchains — especially when it comes to developing applications on top of them. The architecture is too complex, there are glaring technical limitations (as pointed out by Dabit), platforms like Ethereum are slow and expensive (not to mention the environmental impacts), and there’s no evidence yet that mainstream users even want blockchain applications.</blockquote>
* inefficient: https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1459918242466578436
** "they are obsessed with running everything, literally everything, on blockchains, and i do not know why.  i don't want the entire web to be inefficiently bittorrented around all the time.  that sounds like a very silly idea?" [https://eev.ee/ @eevee] November 14, 2021

=== Lack of consensus on meaning ===

=== Meaning polluted with buy cryptocurrency ===
* Criticism: term is polluted with "buy [[cryptocurrency]]" — https://twitter.com/timbray/status/1466842201766313988
** "Dear world: It is perfectly possible to imagine a radically-decentralized Web and simultaneously disbelieve that basing it on blockchain is necessary or even desirable.<br><br>But de facto, the term “Web3” now means “buy my cryptocurrency” and is thus polluted, probably beyond repair." [https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ @timbray] December 3, 2021

=== Vaporware ===

* https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1459910748147093507
** "it is completely wild to me how many people on here are making 100% confident statements about what is made possible by web3, a thing that does not seem to actually exist<br><br>and right at the same time as facebook releases an AMV about "the metaverse" and pretends it's a product" [https://eev.ee/ @eevee] November 14, 2021
