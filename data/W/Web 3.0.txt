'''<dfn>Web 3.0</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>#web3</dfn>) is a phrase used to pitch visionary sequels to the popularity of "[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 Web 2.0]" to advocate for particular [[plumbing]] solutions looking for problems, starting with the "[[Semantic Web]]" in the late 2000s, [[decentralization]] in the 2010s, and now mostly [[blockchain]]s & cryptocurrencies; the [[IndieWeb]] instead focuses directly on user-centric [[principles|goals]], with technologies only as a means.

== Web 3.0 as Semantic Web ==
The first occurrences of "Web 3.0", occurred during the rise of "Web 2.0" in the mid-2000s, as early as May of 2006, e.g <abbr title="New York Times">NYT</abbr>: [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/technology/23iht-web.html A 'more revolutionary' Web]
<blockquote>Just when the ideas behind "Web 2.0" are starting to enter into the mainstream, the mass of brains behind the World Wide Web is introducing pieces of what may end up being called Web 3.0.</blockquote> 
<img src="https://novaspivack.typepad.com/RadarNetworksTowardsAWebOS.jpg" alt="A conceptual graph of evolution of Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, Web 4.0 along a diagonal with a horizontal time axis, with keywords and technologies sprinkled at each point along the diagonal" style="max-width:66%; float:right" />
as [[SVG]] + Web 2.0 + "[[Semantic Web]]": <blockquote>"… asking what Web 3.0 is," Berners-Lee said. "… maybe when you've got an overlay of scalable vector graphics […] on Web 2.0 and access to a semantic Web integrated across a huge space of data …"</blockquote>
Later in 2007 it was documented as equivalent to "Semantic Web" on various roadmaps, graphs, and articles e.g.:

* https://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2007/02/steps_towards_a.html
** also at http://www.novaspivack.com/technology/how-the-webos-evolves

* https://www.alumniportal-deutschland.org/en/science-research/news-from-science/web-30-semantic-web-metadata/
* http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/web-30-semantic-web-web-20.html
** "Web 3.0, in my opinion is best defined as the third-decade of the Web (2010 - 2020), during which time several key technologies will become widely used. Chief among them will be RDF and the technologies of the emerging Semantic Web"

== Web 3.0 as Mobile ==
The "Mobile Web" was briefly pitched as Web 3.0:
* 2012-08-11 TechCrunch: [https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/11/analysis-web-3-0-the-mobile-era/ Web 3.0: The Mobile Era] <blockquote>Now we’re entering Web 3.0, which is mobile, and we are in the thick of it.</blockquote>

Although other sources asserted "mobile" as part of the "Web 2.0" era, e.g.:
* https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b <blockquote>The rise of Web 2.0 was largely driven by three core layers of innovation: mobile, social and cloud.</blockquote>

== Web 3.0 as Artificial Intelligence ==
Web 3.0 as A.I. has two variants:
=== Web 3.0 as ML AI ===
A.I. meaning Machine Learning (ML): the buzzword hype of Machine Learning in the mid to late 2010s made it sound attractive to lump it into Web 3.0 definitions:
* https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b <blockquote>Web 3.0 is built largely on three new layers of technological innovation: edge computing, decentralised data networks and '''artificial intelligence'''</blockquote>…<blockquote>'''Artificial intelligence & Machine learning''' algorithms have become powerful enough to create useful, indeed sometimes life-saving, predictions and actions.</blockquote> '''Emphasis added.'''

=== Web 3.0 as Symbolic AI ===
A.I. meaning machine "understanding" of conceptually representative symbols and their semantics, and thus an evolution of the "Web 3.0 as Semantic Web" definition, but perhaps with a broader phrase, or a phrase with broader appeal than [[Semantic Web]].
* https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/web-3-0-definition-open-internet-decentralized <blockquote>Artificial Intelligence: Web 3.0’s semantic web will be enabled by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) software capable of decrypting natural language and understanding user intention.</blockquote>

== Web 3.0 as Decentralization ==
* https://gavwood.com/web3lt.html
** "Web 3.0, or as might be termed the "post-Snowden" web, is a reimagination of the sorts of things that we already use the Web for, but with a fundamentally different model for the interactions between parties. Information that we assume to be public, we publish. Information that we assume to be agreed, we place on a consensus-ledger. Information that we assume to be private, we keep secret and never reveal. Communication always takes place over encrypted channels and only with pseudonymous identities as endpoints; never with anything traceable (such as IP addresses). In short, we engineer the system to mathematically enforce our prior assumptions, since no government or organisation can reasonably be trusted."
* https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b
** "Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machines are able to interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer-to-peer networks without the need for third parties."
* https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/web-3-0-definition-open-internet-decentralized
** "Web 3.0’s semantic web will be enabled by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) software capable of decrypting natural language and understanding user intention"

}} where Moxie has build some projects on web3 technology and finds some of the same problems as exist with the current web platforms.
** Quote from the finale: <blockquote>I don’t think it’s on a trajectory to deliver us from centralized platforms, I don’t think it will fundamentally change our relationship to technology, and I think the privacy story is already below par for the internet (which is a pretty low bar!), but I also understand why nerds like me are excited to build for it. ''[…]'' I’m hopeful that the creativity and exploration we’re seeing will have positive outcomes, but I’m not sure if it’s enough to prevent all the same dynamics of the internet from unfolding again.</blockquote>
