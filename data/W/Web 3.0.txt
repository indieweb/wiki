'''<dfn>Web 3.0</dfn>''' is a phrase used to pitch visionary sequels to the popularity of "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0|Web 2.0]" to advocate for particular [[plumbing]] solutions looking for problems, starting with the "[[Semantic Web]]" in the late 2000s, [[decentralization]] in the 2010s, and now mostly [[blockchain]]s & cryptocurrencies; the [[IndieWeb]] instead focuses directly on user-centric [[principles|goals]], with technologies only as a means.
