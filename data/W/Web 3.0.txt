__TOC__
'''<dfn>Web 3.0</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>#web3</dfn>) is a phrase used to pitch visionary sequels to the popularity of "[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 Web 2.0]" to advocate for particular [[plumbing]] solutions looking for problems, starting with the "[[Semantic Web]]" in the late 2000s, [[decentralization]] in the 2010s, and now mostly [[blockchain]]s & cryptocurrencies; the [[IndieWeb]] instead focuses directly on user-centric [[principles|goals]], with technologies only as a means.

** "My thought on the web3 discussion: there is absolutely something interesting with a lot of positive potential there, but if you buy into a bunch of Techno Utopian ideology that blinds you to the fact that power dynamics exist everywhere, you’re simply repeating past mistakes."
