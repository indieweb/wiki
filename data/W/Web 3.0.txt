'''<dfn>Web 3.0</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>#web3</dfn>) is a phrase used to pitch visionary sequels to the popularity of "[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 Web 2.0]" to advocate for particular [[plumbing]] solutions looking for problems, starting with the "[[Semantic Web]]" in the late 2000s, [[decentralization]] in the 2010s, and now mostly [[blockchain]]s & cryptocurrencies; the [[IndieWeb]] instead focuses directly on user-centric [[principles|goals]], with technologies only as a means.


== Web 3.0 as Semantic Web ==
The first occurrences of "Web 3.0", occurred during the rise of "Web 2.0" in the mid-2000s, as early as May of 2006, e.g <abbr title="New York Times">NYT</abbr>: [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/technology/23iht-web.html A 'more revolutionary' Web]
<blockquote>Just when the ideas behind "Web 2.0" are starting to enter into the mainstream, the mass of brains behind the World Wide Web is introducing pieces of what may end up being called Web 3.0.</blockquote>

as [[SVG]] + Web 2.0 + "[[Semantic Web]]": <blockquote>"… asking what Web 3.0 is," Berners-Lee said. "… maybe when you've got an overlay of scalable vector graphics […] on Web 2.0 and access to a semantic Web integrated across a huge space of data …"</blockquote>
Later in 2007 it was documented as equivalent to "Semantic Web" on various roadmaps, graphs, and articles e.g.:

** "Web 3.0, in my opinion is best defined as the third-decade of the Web (2010 - 2020), during which time several key technologies will become widely used. Chief among them will be RDF and the technologies of the emerging Semantic Web"

== Web 3.0 as Decentralization ==

** "Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machines are able to interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer-to-peer networks without the need for third parties."

** "Web 3.0’s semantic web will be enabled by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) software capable of decrypting natural language and understanding user intention"

** "Sign of our times: web3 used to be used to describe a decentralized, semantic web, where power was retaken by the final user: power on privacy, power on ownership<br>Now it is a flag put on top of ponzi pyramids whose main observable effect are to ruin people, taldnrs and our planet" [https://medium.com/@fanf42/ @fanf42] September 30, 2021

** "Yup, this about sums it up. A lot of centralization (re: tech billionaires) exists because "it's easier, and people want it."<br>That doesn't mean that it's necessary or desirable.<br>However, in its current instantiation, most of decentralization a la "web3" is just grift & greed."

** "The term web2 wasn't coined by charlatans cooking up planet-destroying algorithms while pushing crypto pyramid schemes and selling worthless signed pointers to things. Web3 proponents are ridiculed because there is plenty of reason to do so, not because people have changed." [https://twitter.com/mortenmertner @mortenmertner] September 30, 2021
