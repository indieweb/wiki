'''<dfn>[https://webflow.com Webflow]</dfn>''' is a website design tool that can output auto-generated html/css/js for a simple [[static site]].

== Criticism ==
* From chat, 2017-05-08: [[Chrome]] only web app that requires [[JS]]. Used to support Firefox but then they explicitly disabled it due to a scrollbar styling issues apparently. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-05-08#t1494285657480000]
** As of 2024-12-23, Webflow [https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961373276435-Troubleshoot-issues-in-Webflow support documentation] indicates they supports modern browsers, including Firefox:
<blockquote>“Webflow officially supports the last three major versions of all modern browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. Make sure you’re using the latest version of whichever browser you’re using to work on your site in Webflow.”</blockquote>
