If you need an administrator (e.g. to provide the content of deleted pages), [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] overlaps the wikipedia and indieweb community.

== Features ==
Interesting Features of Wikipedia, beyond [[MediaWiki]], that may serve as inspiration for various IndieWeb efforts (e.g. [[site-homepage#New_live_modules|IndieWeb homepage Brainstorming: new live modules]]).

* '''Featured Article''' — Wikipedia’s home page has a module: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#mp-tfa-h2 "From today's featured article"]) — an article that is displayed more prominently. 
** Uses the "primary" image and first two paragraphs of a wiki page to summarize as the "featured article"
** Side-effect (unknown if intentional) the featured article image becomes the featured photo for the entire Wikipedia home page!
* '''[[on this day]]'''  — ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#mp-otd-h2 module on Wikipedia])
