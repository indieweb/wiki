'''<dfn>[https://w3c.github.io/manifest/ Web App Manifest]</dfn>''' is a W3C living document that defines a JSON [[sidefile]] for web applications to publish information such as their name, icon, description.

== How to use for IndieAuth ==
It has been [https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/23 proposed that WAM could be used for Client Information Discovery] in IndieAuth. There are some simple steps to be able to do this.

* When checking for a <code>rel=redirect_url</code>, check for <code>rel=manifest</code> (More information on [https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#obtaining obtaining a WAM url can be found here]).
** If <code>rel=manifest</code> is not found, fallback to mf2 parsing or other fallback
** If <code>rel=manifest</code> is found, create the manifestUrl by grabbing the <code>href</code> attribute from the element. If there is no http prefix, add the client_id to the beginning of the <code>href</code> string.
*** Make a GET request to the manifest url and parse the response as JSON.
**** the <code>name</code> attribute becomes the app name
**** one of the items in the <code>icons</code> array can become the app logo. Note, there can be different icons of different sizes. You'll want to grab the appropriate one based on its size.
***** The icons array contain objects that are src (the image url), sizes (a string about the size of the image at that url) and type (mime type).

== IndieWeb Usage ==

=== Consumers ===
==== Eddie Hinkle ====
{{eddiehinkle.com}} added WAM parsing support into [[abode]]'s Authorization endpoint [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-21#t1534866140311500 on Aug 21, 2018].

==== WordPress ====

{{gwg}} added basic WAM parsing support into the [[Wordpress_IndieAuth_Plugin]] on August 23, 2018.

The plugin searches for a manifest and uses the icon and name data from there. If not, it looks for an 'icon' link, then 'apple-touch-icon', etc. It does not currently look by size and picks the first one. For name, it falls back onto application-name as noted by the manifest specification, if not it will look for an og:title, then a title tag.
