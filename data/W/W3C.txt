The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium]</dfn> (W3C)''' is an international standards organization for the world wide web where several IndieWeb community members participated actively in the Social Web Working Group, and produced several W3C Recommendations for key IndieWeb [[building blocks]].

== W3C Recommendations and Notes ==
The following W3C Recommendations were developed as IndieWeb [[building blocks]] and edited by members of the IndieWeb community as part of the W3C Social Web Working Group:
* 📄[[Webmention]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention
* 📄[[Micropub]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub
* 📄[[WebSub]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/websub

In addition, the following W3C Notes published in-progress work from the IndieWeb community:
* 📃[[IndieAuth]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth
* 📃[[JF2]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/jf2
* 📃[[Post Type Discovery]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/post-type-discovery

These standards are now evolved in the IndieWeb community:

== Workshop on Social Standards ==
In 2013, W3C organized the '''[[2013/osfw3c|Workshop on Social Standards]]''' where several IndieWeb community members presented and participated in discussions, and which subsequently drove the creation of the W3C Social Web Working Group.
