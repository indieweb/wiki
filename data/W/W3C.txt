The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium]</dfn> (W3C)''' is an international standards organization for the world wide web where several IndieWeb community members participated actively in the Social Web Working Group, and produced several W3C Recommendations for key IndieWeb [[building blocks]].

== W3C Recommendations and Notes ==
The following W3C Recommendations were developed as IndieWeb [[building blocks]] and edited by members of the IndieWeb community as part of the W3C Social Web Working Group:

* 📄[[Webmention]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention
* 📄[[Micropub]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub
* 📄[[WebSub]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/websub

In addition, the following W3C Notes published in-progress work from the IndieWeb community:
* 📃[[IndieAuth]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth
* 📃[[JF2]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/jf2
* 📃[[Post Type Discovery]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/post-type-discovery

These standards are now evolved in the IndieWeb community:

== Social Web Working Group  ==
In 2014, W3C launched the Social Web Working Group, co-chaired by  IndieWebCamp participants {{tantek}} and Evan Prodromou, and IBM representative Arnaud Le Hors. The working group has a wiki at https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg and participation is encouraged.

== Spec Development Lifecycle ==

== Workshop on Social Standards ==
In 2013, W3C organized the '''[[2013/osfw3c|Workshop on Social Standards]]''' where several IndieWeb community members presented and participated in discussions, and which subsequently drove the creation of the W3C Social Web Working Group.

== Downtime ==
Occasionally W3C’s server and services are down, you may want to keep local copies of key specifications for that reason.
=== 2022-01-22 ===
Many W3C services unavailable due to power outage:

** "Hey @w3c_systeam https://status.w3.org/ says everything okay but http://w3.org/TR is giving 503 and reporting by email failed as it couldn't contact the mail server" https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJtwHQUXoAQSwit.png [http://svgees.us @svgeesus] January 22, 2022

=== 2022-03-29 ===
W3C blog (and possibly other services) was unreliable most of the day and returned [[503]] and occasionally [[502]] errors.
