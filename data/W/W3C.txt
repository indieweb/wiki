The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium]</dfn> (W3C)''' is an international standards organization for the world wide web.


== Social Web Working Group  ==
__TOC__
In 2014, W3C launched the Social Web Working Group, co-chaired by  IndieWebCamp participants {{tantek}} and Evan Prodromou, and IBM representative Arnaud Le Hors. The working group has a wiki at https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg and participation is encouraged.

== Spec Development Lifecycle ==

== Workshop on Social Standards ==
In 2013, W3C organized the '''[[2013/osfw3c|Workshop on Social Standards]]''' where several IndieWeb community members presented and participated in discussions, and which subsequently drove the creation of the W3C Social Web Working Group.

== Issues ==
''Please help expand this section''

Difficulty has been reported in the application process to be an "invited expert" in the Social Web Working Group. The link to the application prompts for a login, which is confusing. You must first create a W3C account at https://www.w3.org/accounts/request, then open the application once you are logged in.

== Resources ==
W3C hosts various resources at permalinks, e.g. http://www.w3.org/Icons/
