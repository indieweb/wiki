The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium]</dfn> (W3C)''' is an international standards organization where several IndieWeb community members participate in the [[Social Web Incubator Community Group]], and were previously active in the [[Social Web Working Group]], which produced several W3C Recommendations for key IndieWeb [[building blocks]].

== W3C Recommendations and Notes ==
The following W3C Recommendations were developed as IndieWeb [[building blocks]] and edited by members of the IndieWeb community as part of the W3C Social Web Working Group (SocialWG):
__TOC__
* ðŸ“„[[Webmention]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention
* ðŸ“„[[Micropub]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub
* ðŸ“„[[WebSub]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/websub

The following W3C Notes published in-progress work from the IndieWeb community:
* ðŸ“ƒ[[IndieAuth]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth
* ðŸ“ƒ[[JF2]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/jf2
* ðŸ“ƒ[[Post Type Discovery]] - https://www.w3.org/TR/post-type-discovery

These standards are now evolved in the IndieWeb community on https://spec.indieweb.org/, e.g.:
* https://webmention.net/draft/
* https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/
* https://jf2.spec.indieweb.org/
* https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/

The SocialWG also published the following W3C Recommendations which are implemented by IndieWeb services & software in use by many in the community:
* [[ActivityPub]]
* [[Activity Streams 2.0]]

== Social Web Incubator Community Group ==
{{main|Social Web Incubator Community Group}}
AKA "SWICG". This section is a stub. See: https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG

== Social Web Working Group  ==
{{main|Social Web Working Group}}
In 2014, W3C launched the Social Web Working Group, co-chaired by  IndieWebCamp participants {{tantek}} and Evan Prodromou, and IBM representative Arnaud Le Hors. The working groupâ€™s home page was its wiki page at https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg. It closed on 2018-02-13 and subsequent work on specs has continued in the IndieWeb community.

== Spec Development Lifecycle ==

== Workshop on Social Standards ==
In 2013, W3C organized the '''[[2013/osfw3c|Workshop on Social Standards]]''' where several IndieWeb community members presented and participated in discussions, and which subsequently drove the creation of the W3C Social Web Working Group.

== Downtime ==
Occasionally W3Câ€™s server and services are down, you may want to keep local copies of key specifications for that reason.
=== 2022-01-22 ===
Many W3C services unavailable due to power outage:

W3C blog (and possibly other services) was unreliable most of the day and returned [[503]] and occasionally [[502]] errors.
