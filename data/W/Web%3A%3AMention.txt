Web::Mention is a [[Webmention]] library for the Perl programming language, developed by {{jmac}}. It is free and open-source software, and is available through [https://www.cpan.org the CPAN].

Web::Mention (pronounced "Web mention" -- the colon-colon being a silent Perlish naming convention) thoroughly implements the Webmention standard, well enough to pass all the tests posed by [[Webmention.rocks]]. It can send webmentions manually, or automatically based on given HTML. It can parse and verify webmentions received via HTTP, can also extract information about a verified webmention's [[author]] and [[comments|displayable content]], using the respective IndieWeb algorithms for these tasks.
