'''<dfn>Wordle</dfn>''' is a word game made by Josh Wardle in which players get six tries to guess a word. When the game is over, a player has the option to copy a grid of tiles that shows how the game progressed, enabling the player to share her/his game on social media, text, or email, without spoiling it for others. Sharing on [[silo]]s like [[Twitter]] helped popularise the game. The share feature copies a block of text, which means you can also post your game results on your own site.

In January, 2022, The [[New York Times]] company bought the game from Wardle and moved it to the New York Times website shortly afterwards.


== Why ==

You can save a copy of every game you play, creating an archive of your results. Also, since Wordle is owned by The New York Times, that company controls access to not only the game, but your stats. Saving a copy of your game results preserves your access to your own Wordle history.

== How ==

Wordle provides a simple sharing mechanism. After completing a game, there's a pop over screen that shows your stats, with a "share" button. Pressing that button copies your results as plain text. You can then paste that text into a post for your site, and [[POSSE]] it to silos if you wish.

You can also calculate statistics on your Wordle games (win percentage, winning streaks, etc.).

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* Brian Tremblay saves copies of his Wordle game results as an h-feed on https://btrem.com/feed/wordle. He also calculates the same statistics that New York Times generates and posts them at the top of that page.
