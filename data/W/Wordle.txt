'''<dfn>Wordle</dfn>''' is a word game made by Josh Wardle in which players get six tries to guess a word. When the game is over, a player has the option to copy a grid of tiles that shows how the game progressed, enabling the player to share her/his game on social media, text, or email, without spoiling it for others. Sharing on [[silo]]s like [[Twitter]] helped popularise the game. The share feature copies a block of text, which means you can also post your game results on your own site.

In January, 2022, The New York Times company bought the game from Wardle and moved it to the New York Times website shortly afterwards.
