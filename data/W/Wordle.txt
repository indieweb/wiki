'''<dfn>Wordle</dfn>''' is a word game made by Josh Wardle in which players get six tries to guess a word. When the game is over, a player has the option to copy a grid of tiles that shows how the game progressed, enabling the player to share her/his game on social media, text, or email, without spoiling it for others. This sharing mechanism helped popularise the game.
