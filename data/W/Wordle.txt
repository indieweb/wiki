'''<dfn>Wordle</dfn>''' is a word game made by Josh Wardle that involves guessing a word, purchased by the [[New York Times]] in 2022, and some IndieWeb community members post their successful game results to their personal sites.

Game & sharing summary: players get six tries to guess a word. When the game is over, a player has the option to copy a grid of tiles that shows how the game progressed, enabling the player to share her/his game on social media, text, or email, without spoiling it for others.

Sharing successful game completions on [[silo]]s like [[Twitter]] helped popularize the game. The share feature copies a block of text, which means you can also post your game results on your own site.

== Why ==
=== Why post your Wordle ===
Why post Wordle results to your own site:

If you want to save your game statistics on the New York Times website, you have to create an [[account]], or at least enable [[cookie]]s and allow their website to store them indefinitely, both of which raise [[privacy]] concerns. 

Additionally, while The New York Times has not placed a pay wall in front of the game, that could change. For that matter, the paper could shut down the game altogether, deleting your data.

By posting game results to your own site, you can create your own Wordle archive, guaranteeing access to your data.

== How ==
=== How to post your Wordle ===
Wordle provides a simple sharing mechanism. After completing a game, there's a pop over screen that shows your stats, with a "share" button. Pressing that button copies your results as plain text. You can then paste that text into a post to manually [[PESOS]] it to your site, and [[POSSE]] it to silos if you wish.

You can also calculate statistics on your Wordle games (win percentage, winning streaks, etc.).

=== Brian Tremblay ===
Brian Tremblay saves copies of his Wordle game results as an [[h-feed]] since YYYY-MM-DD:

He also calculates the same statistics that New York Times generates and posts them at the top of that page.

== History ==
=== Acquisition ===
In January 2022, The [[New York Times]] company bought the game from Wardle and moved it to the New York Times website shortly afterwards. Since the NYT has a paywall, which could at some point be used to block access to Wordle historical game play information, there is additional motivation to post results on personal sites.
