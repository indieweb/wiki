'''<dfn>Wordpress.com</dfn>''' is a blog hosting service that runs the [[WordPress]] open source software.

These addition services can run anywhere from $3/month to over $25/month depending on the level of additional services supplied.

=== WebSub ===
Supports [[WebSub]] as a publisher on all [[Atom]] feeds hosted on wordpress.com since [http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/03/03/rub-a-dub-dub-in-the-pubsubhubbub/ 2010-03-03]. [http://en.support.wordpress.com/pubsubhubbub/ More detail here].

* Note: Bridgy's [https://www.brid.gy/about#blogs Webmentions for blogs] gets real-time updates from wordpress.com in order to send webmentions on their behalf.

== Criticism ==

=== comment silo ===
When commenting on other blogs hosted on Wordpress.com, (even blogs with a custom domain such as gigaom.com), it makes you sign in using your Wordpress.com account. 

There is a section on your logged-in view, "[https://wordpress.com/activities/comments/ comments I made]" which is supposed to show you comments you made on other wordpress.com blogs. However it did not show the latest comment I made on a gigaom.com post, despite it forcing me to log in to my Wordpress.com account to make the comment. <span class="h-card">[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 14:38, 13 January 2015 (PST)

WordPress.com is a blog hosting service with impressive importing and export features. See for details:

=== Hosted themes ===
WordPress.com provides themes to change the HTML/CSS/JS and general appearance of a user's site. While users can pay for a feature to write custom CSS, they can't change their theme markup. Which means amongst other things, a user cannot specify some markup in a post to show on a permanlink page and not in the post when it's a part of a feed. For example,

=== webmention ===
WordPress.com doesn't have built in support for [[webmention]]s, but [[Bridgy]] can send, receive, and display webmentions for WordPress.com blogs. You can also receive webmentions with [[webmention.io]] and maybe [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com].

=== cURL Problem ===
On 2014-05-06 it was [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-06/line/1399412640 reported] that http://indiewebify.me returned an empty result when attempting to check gabrielscheer.com. That domain is hosted on wordpress.com and it appears that wordpress.com is blocking some cURL requests based on the User-Agent. At a minimum, it appears that wordpress.com is blocking cURL requests with the Guzzle User-Agent.

This issue was previously reported on Github on 2013-05-19 [https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/325]

==== Examples ====

* curl -i -H 'User-agent: Guzzle' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- fails
* curl -i -H 'User-agent: indiewebify.me' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- works
* curl -i -H 'User-agent: curl' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- works

=== Unsafe Third Party Advertisements ===

Based on Wordpress.com Terms of Service,"Automattic reserves the right to display advertisements on your blog unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads," and Automatic, based on their privacy policy uses cookies to deliver targeted advertisements.

These targeted advertisements are hard to remove without upgrading to a paid plan. In fact, based on the privacy policy," Automattic does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services ."

These targeted advertisements, presented by third-party ad networks, often reflect a bias in our society. For example, there is evidence of engendered sexism with women being targeted with ads about weight loss and body shaming at a far greater rate than men. Keywords such as anxiety, mental health, diet, and exercise can serve up advertisements, on site registered to females, that may act as a trigger for vulnerable populations.

In one documented instance Automattic repeatedly displays, through their third-party vendors, fat shaming advertisements on a blog about overcoming eating disorders.

=== Limit Likes ===
In addition to the fact that their built-in [[like]] functionality is done in a way that doesn't let the user own their own likes, it is apparently either rate limited or limited in some ways to prevent spammy or malicious behavior as indicated in this post: [https://gardenofalchemy.blog/2019/05/05/i-ran-out-of-likes-wtf/ I Ran Out of Likes! Wtf?]. 

Each like sends a notification to the site owner, a process that can potentially be viewed as spam notifications if they're unwanted or egregious. It is unknown how many likes will cause the initiating user to "run out".

== POSSE to hosted ==
It is possible to manually [[POSSE]] [[articles]] to Wordpress.com.
=== IndieWeb POSSE Examples ===
==== Shane Becker ====
{{veganstraightedge}} is manually POSSEing his articles to Wordpress.com.
* http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2010/11/07/no-more-sharecropping
** POSSE copy: https://veganstraightedge.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/no-more-sharecropping

==== Chris Aldrich ====
{{chrisaldrich}} automatically POSSEs (mostly articles) from his self-hosted WordPress install to his WordPress.com account using [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost/ WordPress Crosspost]. This allows people who were following his old blog to continue to get updates without needing to migrate.

== Micropub ==
It is possible to use [[Micropub]] clients like Quill to post to blogs on Wordpress.com using [[Feverdream]] as a bridge.
