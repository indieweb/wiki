'''<dfn>Wordpress.com</dfn>''' is a blog hosting service that runs the [[WordPress]] open source software.

== Why ==
Wordpress.com provides a free tier for blogs hosted at *.wordpress.com URLs with a variety of great services and options.

There are for-pay options to:
* use your own custom domain name
* remove advertising
* add plugins or purchase other themes
These addition services can run anywhere from $3/month to over $25/month depending on the level of additional services supplied.

=== WebSub ===
Supports [[WebSub]] as a publisher on all [[Atom]] feeds hosted on wordpress.com since [http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/03/03/rub-a-dub-dub-in-the-pubsubhubbub/ 2010-03-03]. [http://en.support.wordpress.com/pubsubhubbub/ More detail here].

* Note: Bridgy's [https://www.brid.gy/about#blogs Webmentions for blogs] gets real-time updates from wordpress.com in order to send webmentions on their behalf.

== Criticism ==

=== comment silo ===
When commenting on other blogs hosted on Wordpress.com, (even blogs with a custom domain such as gigaom.com), it makes you sign in using your Wordpress.com account. 

There is a section on your logged-in view, "[https://wordpress.com/activities/comments/ comments I made]" which is supposed to show you comments you made on other wordpress.com blogs. However it did not show the latest comment I made on a gigaom.com post, despite it forcing me to log in to my Wordpress.com account to make the comment. <span class="h-card">[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 14:38, 13 January 2015 (PST)

WordPress.com is a blog hosting service with impressive importing and export features. See for details:

=== Hosted themes ===
WordPress.com provides themes to change the HTML/CSS/JS and general appearance of a user's site. While users can pay for a feature to write custom CSS, they can't change their theme markup. Which means amongst other things, a user cannot specify some markup in a post to show on a permanlink page and not in the post when it's a part of a feed. For example,

=== webmention ===
WordPress.com doesn't have built in support for [[webmention]]s, but [[Bridgy]] can send, receive, and display webmentions for WordPress.com blogs. You can also receive webmentions with [[webmention.io]] and maybe [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com].

=== cURL Problem ===
On 2014-05-06 it was [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-06/line/1399412640 reported] that http://indiewebify.me returned an empty result when attempting to check gabrielscheer.com. That domain is hosted on wordpress.com and it appears that wordpress.com is blocking some cURL requests based on the User-Agent. At a minimum, it appears that wordpress.com is blocking cURL requests with the Guzzle User-Agent.

This issue was previously reported on Github on 2013-05-19 [https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/325]

==== Examples ====

* curl -i -H 'User-agent: Guzzle' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- fails
* curl -i -H 'User-agent: indiewebify.me' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- works
* curl -i -H 'User-agent: curl' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- works

=== Unsafe Third Party Advertisements ===

Based on Wordpress.com Terms of Service,"Automattic reserves the right to display advertisements on your blog unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads," and Automatic, based on their privacy policy uses cookies to deliver targeted advertisements.

These targeted advertisements are hard to remove without upgrading to a paid plan. In fact, based on the privacy policy," Automattic does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services ."

These targeted advertisements, presented by third-party ad networks, often reflect a bias in our society. For example, there is evidence of engendered sexism with women being targeted with ads about weight loss and body shaming at a far greater rate than men. Keywords such as anxiety, mental health, diet, and exercise can serve up advertisements, on site registered to females, that may act as a trigger for vulnerable populations.

In one documented instance Automattic repeatedly displays, through their third-party vendors, fat shaming advertisements on a blog about overcoming eating disorders.

== POSSE to hosted ==
It is possible to manually [[POSSE]] [[articles]] to Wordpress.com.
=== IndieWeb POSSE Examples ===
==== Shane Becker ====
{{veganstraightedge}} is manually POSSEing his articles to Wordpress.com.
* http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2010/11/07/no-more-sharecropping
** POSSE copy: https://veganstraightedge.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/no-more-sharecropping

==== Chris Aldrich ====
{{chrisaldrich}} automatically POSSEs (mostly articles) from his self-hosted WordPress install to his WordPress.com account using [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost/ WordPress Crosspost]. This allows people who were following his old blog to continue to get updates without needing to migrate.

== Micropub ==
It is possible to use [[Micropub]] clients like Quill to post to blogs on Wordpress.com using [[Feverdream]] as a bridge.
