The '''<dfn>[https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieauth/ WordPress IndieAuth Plugin]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that adds [[indieauth]] login support to WordPress.


== Use Cases ==
The below is brainstorming the use cases that this plugin solves or will solve in the future.

=== Logging in to a single-user Wordpress via RelMeAuth ===
✔️ Currently implemented

Assumptions:
* The Wordpress site has only one user account
* The home page lists one or more rel=me profiles to Twitter, GitHub, etc.
* The user wants to use RelMeAuth to log in to Wordpress instead of typing a password

How it works:
* When installing the plugin, the admin configures an authentication service to use (e.g. indielogin.com)
* When viewing the Wordpress login screen, there is an additional [[web sign-in]] prompt under the username/password
* The user enters the URL of their Wordpress site, and the plugin redirects to the authentication service
* The plugin verifies the auth code with the service and logs the user in 

Brainstorming:
* While WordPress sites with only one user aren't uncommon, it isn't a guarantee we should assume.
* The Indieweb plugin has a property that allows a user to declare a site is a single or multi-author site, which accounts for the possibility of an admin and a regular user account for the same person.
* WordPress itself has a is_multi_author function to test for multiple published authors.

=== Logging in to a multi-user Wordpress site via IndieAuth ===
❌ Not yet implemented

Assumptions:
* The Wordpress site has multiple user accounts (example.com/alice, example.com/bethany)
* Each user has their own separate website that supports [[IndieAuth]] or [[RelMeAuth]]
** example.com/alice -> alice.example.com (which has its own built-in IndieAuth server)
** example.com/bethany -> bethany.example.org (which links to twitter.com/bethanyexample)
* The users want to use their own website identity to log in to the group Wordpress instead of typing a password

How it works:
* When installing the plugin, the admin configures an authentication service to use for RelMeAuth fallback (e.g. indielogin.com)
* When viewing the Wordpress login screen, there is an additional [[web sign-in]] prompt under the username/password
* The user enters their personal URL (not the same domain as the wordpress site)
* The plugin checks if their personal URL advertises an [[authorization endpoint]], and redirects there if so, and redirects to indielogin.com if not
* Upon being redirected back to complete the flow, the plugin verifies the code with the appropriate endpoint (will need to store the endpoint in session data)

=== Posting to Wordpress from Micropub clients ===
❌ Not yet implemented
