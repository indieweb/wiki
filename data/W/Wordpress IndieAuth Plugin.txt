The '''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ WordPress IndieAuth Plugin]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that adds [[IndieAuth]] support to WordPress.

* WordPress official repository: https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/
* GitHub development version: https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieauth/

The original release, written in 2013 by {{pfefferle}}, added support for logging into a WordPress site using Indieauth.com. The intention from the beginning was to eventually make WordPress an IndieAuth server as well.

In 2017, after stagnation, the plugin was transferred to the Indieweb repository. {{gwg}} rewrote the existing functionality as it used unsupported/undocumented features of Indieauth.com and made the plugin usable with any IndieAuth server, not just Indieauth.com. Version 2.0, now released, also implements an IndieAuth endpoint inside the plugin, instead of relying on Indieauth.com.

== Terminology ==

* '''web sign-in''' - logging in to WordPress
* '''IndieAuth''' - using wordpress to log in to other places such as Micropub apps

== Use Cases ==
The below is brainstorming the use cases that this plugin solves or will solve in the future. These should include enough information and steps to be able to test the plugin when making changes.

=== Web Sign-In ===
==== Logging in to a multi-user WordPress site via IndieAuth ====
<span id="Logging_in_to_a_multi-user_Wordpress_via_IndieAuth"></span>

Assumptions:
* A group WordPress blog with this plugin, e.g. https://notiz.blog/
* An individual with a personal WordPress blog with this plugin, e.g. https://pfefferle.org/
** Note: this works just as well with a personal site that supports IndieAuth that does not run WordPress
* There is a user record in notiz.blog with the user's profile URL of https://pfefferle.org/

Plugin Configuration:
* notiz.blog
** The IndieWeb plugin is set to a multi-author site
** The IndieAuth plugin has the "Use IndieAuth login" setting checked
** The IndieAuth plugin is set to use the built-in IndieAuth endpoint
* pfefferle.org
** The IndieWeb plugin is set to a single-author site
** The IndieAuth plugin is set to use the built-in IndieAuth endpoint

How it Works:
* When the user views the Wordpress login screen of the group blog, there is an additional [[web sign-in]] prompt under the username/password
* The user enters the URL that is in their profile (their personal site), and the plugin redirects to their personal wordpress site
* The user sees the login request prompt and clicks "Approve"
* The user is redirected back to the group blog with an authorization code in the query string
* The group blog verifies the authorization code with the user's WordPress site, and then starts a session for the user

==== Logging in to a multi-user WordPress site via RelMeAuth ====
ðŸš« This is not currently supported

Assumptions:
* A group WordPress blog with this plugin, e.g. https://notiz.blog/
* An individual with a personal WordPress blog, e.g. https://pfefferle.org/
** The personal blog does not have the IndieAuth plugin installed
** The personal blog has a rel=me link to Twitter and GitHub on the home page
* There is a user record in notiz.blog with the user's profile URL of https://pfefferle.org/

Plugin Configuration:
* notiz.blog
** The IndieWeb plugin is set to a multi-author site
** The IndieAuth plugin has the "Use IndieAuth login" setting checked
** The IndieAuth plugin is set to use the built-in IndieAuth endpoint
* pfefferle.org
** No IndieAuth plugin is installed
** A GitHub and Twitter username are entered in the user's profile
** The IndieWeb Plugin is installed, which adds rel=me links to the user's GitHub and Twitter profile

How it Works:
* When the user views the Wordpress login screen of the group blog, there is an additional [[web sign-in]] prompt under the username/password
* The user enters the URL that is in their profile (their personal site)
* The group blog does not find an IndieAuth server at that URL, but notices the rel=me links
* The group blog sends the user to indielogin.com to complete the [[RelMeAuth]] authentication
* Upon a successful authentication (via Twitter or GitHub, etc) at indielogin.com, the user is redirected back to the group blog with an authorization code from indielogin.com
* The group blog verifies the authorization code with indielogin.com and starts a session for the user

=== IndieAuth ===
