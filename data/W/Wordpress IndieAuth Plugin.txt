The '''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ WordPress IndieAuth Plugin]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that adds [[IndieAuth]] support to WordPress.

* WordPress official repository: https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/
* GitHub development version: https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieauth/

The original release, written in 2013 by {{pfefferle}}, added support for logging into a WordPress site using Indieauth.com. The intention from the beginning was to eventually make WordPress an IndieAuth server as well.

In 2017, after stagnation, the plugin was transferred to the Indieweb repository. {{gwg}} rewrote the existing functionality as it used unsupported/undocumented features of Indieauth.com and made the plugin usable with any IndieAuth server, not just Indieauth.com. Version 2.0, now released, also implements an IndieAuth endpoint inside the plugin, instead of relying on Indieauth.com.

== Terminology ==

* '''web sign-in''' - logging in to WordPress
* '''IndieAuth''' - using wordpress to log in to other places

== Use Cases ==
The below is brainstorming the use cases that this plugin solves or will solve in the future.

=== Logging in to a multi-user Wordpress via IndieAuth ===
✔️ Implemented in the original release

Assumptions:
* The Website field in the User's profile lists a URL that has one or more [[rel-me|rel="me"]] profiles to Twitter, GitHub, etc.
* The user wants to use another service to log in to Wordpress instead of typing a password. This is usually Rel-Me-Auth.

How it works:
* When installing the plugin, the admin configures an authentication service to use (defaults to indieauth.com). In the original release, it only supported indieauth.com
* When viewing the Wordpress login screen, there is an additional [[web sign-in]] prompt under the username/password
* The user enters the URL that is in their profile, and the plugin redirects to the authentication service
* The plugin verifies the auth code with the service and logs the user in 

Note: The does not currently do discovery on the provided URL to find the authorization_endpoint, but there is a PR pending for this. The trust relationship here is that the user has to add the website to their user account for it to allow login.
