'''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/ WebSub]</dfn>''' (previously known as PubSubHubbub or PuSH, and briefly PubSub) is a notification-based protocol for web publishing and subscribing to [[streams]] and legacy [[feed files]] in real time. Currently there are no known indieweb sites that subscribe to anything via WebSub, but there are a few separate-UI indie-[[readers]] that use WebSub to subscribe to [[h-feed]] streams.

WebSub started as PubSubHubbub, was refined in the [[W3C]] Social Web Working Group, and published as a W3C Recommendation.

== Why ==
You should implement WebSub for your home page updates so that IndieWeb [[readers]] (like [[Woodwind]] and [[Monocle]]) can:
* promptly fetch your posts when you publish them
* and avoid polling your server with unnecessary traffic

== How ==
__TOC__
See: [[How to publish and consume WebSub]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are several indieweb sites producing WebSub notifications, and a few indieweb-centric applications that consume them (see in particular indie [[reader]]s, [[Shrewdness]] and [[Woodwind]]).

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] to send WebSub notifications from his site tantek.com 
* [http://tantek.com/2010/032/t3/bits-tweeting-from-my-site-favicon-twitter-pubsubhubbub 2010-02-01 onward] PuSH 0.3 notification sent for each entry in his Atom feed file 
* [http://tantek.com/2015/077/t3/switched-google-hub-to-superfeedr 2015-03-18 onward] PuSH 0.4 notification sent for each [[h-entry]] post on tantek.com HTML + [[h-feed]] home page

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] to send PuSH notifications from his site aaronparecki.com
* 2012-08-18 through 2015-02-27 - PuSH 0.3 notification for every entry in his Atom feeds (notes, articles and replies). Using Google's appspot.com hub.
* 2015-02-27 onward - PuSH 0.4 notification for every feed that is updated after a post is created, including  [[h-entry]]s on home page, notes/articles/replies/etc pages, and tag pages. Using Superfeedr's hub.
* 2015-03-26 - changed hub from Superfeedr to [[Switchboard]]

=== Bret Comnes ===
{{bret}} sends PuSH notifications for his bret.io Github Pages/Jekyll Atom feed file [http://bret.io/2014/03/16/github-pages-pubsubhubbub-support-levels-up/ since 2014-03-16].
* PuSH 0.4 support with his home page [[h-entry]]s [https://github.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/blob/a29b0bf5cb26871f1c1002a2f8078b941c820fca/_includes/head-meta.html since 2015-03-20]

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} uses [[Red Wind]] to send PuSH notifications for new/edited posts and new mentions in his kylewm.com Atom feed file since 2014-03-23
* Now also sending PuSH 0.4 notifications for updates to the main h-feed  at kylewm.com, using a hub at superfeedr.com. Confirmed working 2015-02-21.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
{{barnabywalters}} uses [[Taproot]] to send PuSH notifications for each new post on his WaterPigs.co.uk homepage HTML feed using PuSH 0.4 and Google’s hub since 2014-03-25.

=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} uses [[WordPress]] and the PushPress plugin to send PuSH 0.3 notifications of [https://david.shanske.com/feed/ his RSS feed] updates since 2014-02-16.

=== Matthias Pfefferle ===
{{pfefferle}} uses [[WordPress]] and the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/ WebSub/PubSubHubbub Plugin] (selfdogfooding) to send PuSH notifications since 2011-01-29.
* PuSH 0.4 with h-entrys support since 2012

=== Christian Weiske ===
{{cweiske}} sends PuSH 0.4 notifications since 2015-04-01 using his own hub, [[phubb]].

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} uses [[Known]] to send PuSH 0.4 notifications for each new post on his werd.io homepage HTML feed since at least 2015-05-04 (Known 0.7.8 release date).

=== Pelle Wessman ===
{{voxpelli}} uses GitHub Pages + Superfeedr to send PuSH notifications from his site voxpelli.com
* [https://github.com/voxpelli/voxpelli.github.com/commit/b767625345d78987e9dce11cb0092353fd7ca81d 2011-08-09 onward] - manual PuSH notification sent for each Atom file
* 2015-04-05 - automated notifications using [https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pagebuildevent GitHub page_build webhook]
* [https://github.com/voxpelli/voxpelli.github.com/blob/4d6812d11cb76cabad85eec226403cc4f23fad56/_layouts/default.html 2015-05-16 onward] - PuSH 0.4 notification sent for the home page as well

=== Andy Leap ===
[[User:Vendaria.net|Andy Leap]] sends PuSH 0.4 notifications for [http://vendaria.net Vendaria.net] since 2015-05-16

=== 1000s of Known Sites ===
1000s of *.withknown.com sites send PuSH 0.4 notifications for each new post on their homepages's HTML feed since at least 2015-05-04 when Known 0.7.8 shipped with reliable PuSH 0.4 support.

There are also numerous (hundreds?) of [[Known]] installs that are also all likely running Known 0.7.8 or later and thus send PuSH 0.4 notifications.

=== Malcolm Blaney ===
{{mblaney}} uses [[dobrado]] to send PuSH notifications for new and updated posts. Support was added to dobrado on [https://gitlab.com/dobrado/dobrado/commit/c77b59f7290bd57975971d26649e7332fe18f2d3 2016-05-13]

== Silo Implementations ==

=== Flickr ===
Flickr supports PuSH to subscribe to photos posted within specific locations or with given tags. https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.push.subscribe.html

=== Historical/Deprecated ===
==== Instagram ====
Instagram previously supported PuSH so that apps can subscribe to notifications whenever a user has posted a new photo. Their documentation page (https://instagram.com/developer/subscriptions) now returns 404, which is probably related to deprecation of their API in favor of Facebook's Graph API which only works with business accounts.

== Consuming Implementations ==
The following implementations consume and subscribe to PuSH feeds:

PuSH 0.4:
* [[shrewdness]]
* [[Woodwind]]
*[[dobrado]]

PuSH 0.3:
* [[StatusNet]]
* <strike>[[tt-rss]]</strike> WebSub support [https://tt-rss.org/fox/tt-rss/commit/5b6ea1ef914d0d33516ce59df69637576055ce66 removed 2017-05-16] ([https://discourse.tt-rss.org/t/pubsubhubbub-websub-subscription-not-renewed/184/5 discussion])

== How To ==
=== Publish and Consume a WebSub-enabled feed ===
{{main|How to publish and consume WebSub}}

PuSH 0.4 goes beyond previous versions to allow publishers to send push notifications for ''any'' HTTP resource (e.g. [[h-feed]]s). You should use the newer spec, 0.4. PuSH 0.3 supported push notifications only for legacy XML feed files.

'''See the main article: [[How to publish and consume WebSub]].'''

=== WordPress Plugins for PuSH ===
The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pushpress/ PushPress] plugin can be installed on a self-hosted [[WordPress]] set up. If you're using [[WordPress.com]], they already support PuSH by default (using a built-in version of this plugin).

An alternative plugin written by {{pfefferle}}, that supports the more recent PubSubHubbub v0.4 spec, is the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/ WebSub/PubSubHubbub Plugin].

=== Subscribing to Fragments ===
Superfeedr also offers the unique ability to subscribe to fragments on a page, using the # symbol. For example, if you subscribe to http://tantek.com/#.hentry, you will receive POST to your webhook/callback endpoint with the content of the first element of class "hentry" on http://tantek.com/

This should be seen as an optimization. A minimal consumer can simply re-fetch the resource itself when it receives a ping.

=== Testing your PuSH-enabled feed ===
There are several ways you can test whether or not your PuSH feed and pings are working properly:

==== Testing PuSH 0.4 ====
* [[websub.rocks]] - a validator to help you test your WebSub implementation (publisher and subscriber)


#Subscribe to your home page in one of these indie [[readers]]:
#* [[Woodwind]]
#Publish a new post and send a PuSH 0.4 notification
#Watch the reader to see if your post shows up - it should show up in seconds or less.

==== Testing PuSH 0.3 ====
'''RSS Reader'''

Most [http://blog.superfeedr.com/state-of-pubsubhubbub/ popular RSS Readers] do implement PubSubHubbub, you can just subscribe to your feed on one of them, and see if the update as been propagated after you added content. 

'''Status.net'''

# subscribe to your home page from a Status.net account
# publish stuff on your home page
# see updates appear in real time on your Status.net account

'''Bots'''

There are several [[XMPP]]/[[IRC]] bots which allow you to subscribe to feeds and be notified of updates via any [[XMPP]] or [[IRC]] client. You’ll need an XMPP account, or an IRC client.
* https://github.com/julien51/notifix (see below)
* http://blog.superfeedr.com/notifixlight/
* http://push-bot.appspot.com/

'''Notifix'''

Notifix is a bot (see above for source code). It's constantly connected to irc.freenode.net. Send him a private message like +help to see available commands. Subscribe with +subscribe <feed>, publish your content and see if you get the ping straight via IRC.

* I have had better experiences with notifixlite than PuSH Bot --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 03:16, 5 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Testing your PuSH Subscriber ===
* [[websub.rocks]] - a validator to help you test your WebSub implementation (publisher, subscriber, and hub)
* http://push-pub.appspot.com/ is a useful application for testing your subscribing code. This is a known-working PuSH 0.4 publisher, so you can subscribe to it, post an update, and confirm that you received a ping from its hub.

* [http://git.cweiske.de/push-tester.git/ push-tester] is a tool that mimicks a blog with [[h-feed]] and [[h-entry]] and allows posting new articles with a single click. A configurable PuSH hub is notified about the new post. Public instance: http://push-tester.cweiske.de/

== Hubs ==
* http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com/ 
** You can also register with Superfeedr to get your own subdomain (e.g. https://kylewm.superfeedr.com). This gives you access to useful stats like number of subscribers and notifications.
* https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/
** As far as I have been able to tell, development on this hub completely halted in 2011, and it was left in a weird state. Appears to partially support non-XML feeds but for example requires hub.verify (a parameter that was removed in 0.4). For new development and for all h-feeds I strongly recommend ''not'' using this hub. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 13:55, 28 February 2015 (PST)
** [[User:Onebigfluke.com]] is aware of the issue and planning to fix it. [https://twitter.com/kylewm2/status/571772478910963712 More details on this Twitter thread] [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]
* [[phubb]] - open source PHP PubSubHubbub server
* [https://github.com/aaronpk/Switchboard Switchboard] by {{aaronpk}}
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/ Wordpress plugin]

See https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/PubSubHubbub/wiki/Hubs for more of them.

=== Testing your hub ===
[https://websub.rocks websub.rocks] has a tool that will generate a page with [[h-entry]]s that you can subscribe to.

[http://git.cweiske.de/push-tester.git/ push-tester] is a tool that mimicks a blog with [[h-feed]] and [[h-entry]] and allows posting new articles with a single click. A configurable PuSH hub is notified about the new post.

Public instance: http://push-tester.cweiske.de/

== Discussion ==
Discussion about WebSub primarily occurs on the [https://github.com/w3c/websub/issues GitHub repo], but there's also a W3C community group:
* https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/ - official spec
* https://www.w3.org/community/swicg/ - W3C's Social community group, which works on extensions to the SocialWG's specs, including WebSub. If you're interested in WebSub, and already have a W3C login, you should join as well to help support the overall WebSub effort.

== Brainstorming ==
How can we support PuSH consumers that do not have a publicly routable URL, such as devices behind a firewall or NAT? Maybe a hub or an external service could provide an alternative subscription mechanism such as websockets or eventsource, which could then make the PuSH subscription on behalf of the consumer. <span class="h-card">[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 12:32, 26 May 2015 (PDT)

== Issues ==
=== Too Complex ===
In the past (2013 era) there was controversy about PubSubHubbub being too complex for the indieweb. Since then numerous indieweb sites support PuSH notifications of their published content, and we have a few new PuSH hubs built and maintained by indieweb folks, as well as readers subscribing to PuSH updates. The below is left as historical record of a past issue.

* "PubSubHubbub (by Google for Google) or any push based solution for the web is unnecessarily complex for #indieweb. Polling works just fine.": http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-29#t1369859193
** Polling is fine for async but we're past that now. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 22:24, 25 February 2015 (PST)

== FAQ ==
'''Q:''' How do I update the hub I am using and ensure subscribers update accordingly?

'''A:''' Subscribers should poll occasionally to see if the hub has been updated. You can list and ping both hubs for a while to speed up the process. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-06-30#t1435697212867]. 
Also, hubs should actually notify the hub URL (as part of the discovery links) which means that subscribers will know about the designated hubs with every notification, making it completely optional to have a "routine" polling. 
It's considered good practice when a feed/publisher changes its hub to have a period during which it *also* pings the old hub (even after the discovery link was removed).
