{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Webmention syndication</dfn>''' is the use of the [[Webmention]] protocol as a syndication API, by having an original post link to a serviceâ€™s special URL, then sending a webmention from that post to that service, causing the service to syndicate the post on itself (like [[IndieNews]] or indieweb.xyz) or to another service (like have [[Bridgy]] publish to a silo on your behalf).
