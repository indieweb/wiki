'''<dfn>WordPress</dfn>''' is open source CMS software used by many on the Indieweb as well as a blog hosting service.

There are two "flavors" of WordPress (.org and .com):
* [http://wordpress.org WordPress.ORG] hosts the open source software that one can self-host on their own (or a rented) server and freely configure to set up their website
* [[WordPress.com]] is a for-profit company that provides a blog hosting (SaaS) service using the code available on WordPress.org and because it is less flexible (compared to the WordPress.org version) could be considered a [[silo]]. In particular, themes aren't as easily customizable, javascript isn't allowed, and no additional plugins are available, unless users pay for [https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/dotcom-vip-plugins/ WordPress.com VIP].

Current estimates are that WordPress powers approximately [https://managewp.com/statistics-about-wordpress-usage 26.4% of sites] for which the content management server is identifiable. Some of this is due to the fact that it is very backwards compatible.

In most of the documentation presented on the Indieweb wiki, it's presumed that users are using the self-hosted version from WordPress.org, but this doesn't mean that one can't utilize WordPress.com to build an IndieWeb site. Users should use care to distinguish which version they're using and which instructions they're following.
 
Because the wiki page for WordPress has become relatively large, for ease of use it has been broken up into several sub-pages which include specific information on the following topics

== Getting Help == 

If you need help getting your WordPress site set up for the Indieweb, try the [[WordPress Outreach Club]] or the #indieweb or #indieweb-wordpress channels in [[discuss|chat]], [https://chat.indieweb.org/slack Slack], or [[IRC]].

== Getting Started ==
{{main|Getting Started on WordPress}}

If you're interested in jumping into the IndieWeb, and you've chosen WordPress as your tool of choice, great! 

If you do not have a site... We'll assume you already have your own [[personal-domain]]. After that, you'll need [[web hosting]]. There are plenty of good options. [http://wpengine.com/ WPEngine] is one of the best for both beginners and advanced hackers. [[#WordPress.com hosting service|WordPress.com's hosting service]] is solid and easy to use, but limits you to pre-approved plugins and themes.

Once you've got a domain name, hosting, and installed WordPress head over to [[Getting Started on WordPress]] for a simple step-by-step summary on getting started with Indieweb on your WordPress site. 

If you're a more advanced user/developer you might also take a look at [[Advanced WordPress Set Up]] or read several pages here to plan out what functionality you'd like to add and how best to add it. 

Sometimes documenting and thinking through your [[itches]] can help to determine which pieces of functionality you'd like to add. There are a large number of functionalities one can add to a WordPress site and multiple ways of doing it depending on your level of comfort with code or your ability to add and configure plugins. Some plugins may also have dependencies. Because there's so much to absorb, we recommend people take the time to read through some documentation, the functionalities available, and determine what works best for them. One doesn't necessarily need to do everything or add everything in one day, so feel free to take your time and think through what you want/need--remember it's ''your'' personal site, so build it for what you need and what you'd like to accomplish on the web. Keep coming back and adding pieces incrementally based on your needs and level of ability, and remember there are lots of others doing the same thing who can provide help and encouragement if you need it.

Keep in mind that in late 2015/early 2016, the workflow for adding Indieweb plugins changed relatively drastically with the introduction of the Indieweb Plugin, so use care in following details written prior to that time. Novice users should be aware that one may also find Indieweb related plugins on [[github]] which can conflict with or duplicate functionality in the plugins included in the Indieweb Plugin.

Other articles can also be found scattered throughout the wiki on pages specific to smaller pieces of functionality.

== Plugins ==
{{main|WordPress/Plugins}}

There are many good WordPress plugins. The plugins link above outlines some recommended for Indieweb use and by Indieweb people.

=== Indieweb Plugin ===
The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ Indieweb Plugin] is a plugin that helps you establish your IndieWeb identity and helps you install various Indieweb-themed plugins. It is designed for newcomers to quickly get up and running.


== Themes ==
{{main|WordPress/Themes}}

One of the benefits of WordPress is a huge variety of pre-made and customizable themes available as well as the ability to create your own from scratch. For security, it's recommended that one use the [https://wordpress.org.themes/ official Wordpress Theme Directory].

Presently, many IndieWeb technologies, functionalities, and other services rely on [[microformats]] 2 support, which not many themes currently have. There are many methods to get around this temporary problem. For ease-of-use out of the box, many sites use either the [https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress SemPress] theme or the [https://wordpress.org/themes/independent-publisher/ Independent Publisher] theme. 

For a more comprehensive discussion of WordPress themes for use in IndieWeb, please see [[WordPress/Themes]].


== Bookmarklets for Desktop ==
One big IndieWeb raison d’être is using your own web site to ''easily'' [[reply]], [[like]], [[repost]], and [[RSVP]] to posts and events. You do this by annotating links on your site with simple microformats2 HTML. Having said that, most people don’t want to write HTML just to like or reply to something. To make some IndieWeb actions easier, one can try out any of the following [[Bookmarklet]]s or bookmarklet-type schemes:
* {{pfefferle}} & {{snarfed}}: [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this IndieWeb Press This plugin] based on this [https://snarfed.org/indieweb-press-this-bookmarklets-for-wordpress post]
* [[User:petermolnar.eu|Peter Molnar]]: [https://petermolnar.eu/press-this-indieweb/ Extending Press This in WordPress to support indieweb reply, like and repost] 
* [[User:david.shanske.com|David Shanske]]: indicates that those who use [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds] can create a pseudo bookmarklet with the URL scheme http://www.YOURSITE.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?kind=like&kindurl=@url or http://www.YOURSITE.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?kind=repost&kindurl=@url where the variable "@url" is the permalink of the post. The post kind is then set appropriately as well as the referenced URL which then does the embed

== Mobile ==
For ideas on using WordPress for the IndieWeb on mobile see also [[Posting from mobile devices]]


== Development ==
{{main|WordPress/Development}}

Several projects are actively under development for use in WordPress. Plugins/themes considered complete enough for widespread use  will appear on this page or on [[WordPress/Plugins]].

For common conventions of data storage in WordPress to ensure interoperability, see [[WordPress_Data|WordPress Data]].

For Core Development, brainstorming on development of Indieweb themes/plugins for WordPress and discussion of common conventions to ensure interoperability, see [[WordPress/Development|WordPress Development]].

Most plugins are actively developed on [[github]] and welcome issues, comments, suggestions, and pull requests, so feel free to visit and participate there as well.

== People using WordPress ==
{{main|WordPress/Examples}}

People using WordPress on their primary or other sites as well as people who formerly used WordPress.


== POSSE to WordPress ==
With WordPress's API it's possible to automatically <span id="POSSE">[[POSSE]]</span> posts to it, and there's at least one example of an Indieweb community member doing so to the hosted service: [[WordPress#POSSE_to_hosted|POSSE to hosted]].

Once can actually POSSE entire posts from a self-hosted WordPress (.org) installation to a WordPress.com site using [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost/ WordPress Crosspost].

=== POSSE reply to WordPress ===
It's possible to post a reply to a WordPress blog post on your own site, and then POSSE your reply to the WordPress blog post's comments section, as well as POSSE your reply with threading to anywhere that WordPress blog post itself was POSSEd to, e.g. Twitter. Be aware that POSSEing comments to another WordPress blog will often also trigger a pingback/trackback if the site supports it.

Indie Web Examples:
==== Tantek reply POSSE ====
{{t}} has started experimenting with manually POSSEing reply posts to WordPress blogs to their comment sections. E.g.:
* original reply: http://tantek.com/2014/255/t2/well-deserved-talented-known-minor-correction
* manual POSSE comment: https://gigaom.com/2014/09/11/indieweb-advocates-launch-known-so-bloggers-can-be-social-and-still-control-their-content/#comment-1483187
** related: [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request to [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/271 Publish to WordPress comments] which could help automate this!
* semi-automatic POSSE tweet @-reply: https://twitter.com/t/status/510633038062309376
** only *semi* automatic because I had to dig up the in-reply-to tweet permalink manually, but then the [[POSSE]] copy of my reply and tweet threading was handled automatically by [[Falcon]].

==== aaronpk ====
{{aaronpk}} occasionally manually POSSEs reply posts to the comments section of WordPress blogs. E.g.:
* original reply: http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2015/01/13/2/indie
* semi-automatic tweet reply: https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/555106750433869824 (not fully automatic because required finding the @gigaom tweet permalink manually)
* manual POSSE comment: https://gigaom.com/2015/01/13/ind-ie-scales-back-focuses-on-heartbeat-social-networking-client/#comment-1513998


== Security and Spam Protection ==
{{main|WordPress/Security}}

WordPress is often targeted for attacks and spam due to its popularity. It is important to keep your installation updated and take some basic steps to protect yourself.


== Criticism ==
<span id="Problems">Problems</span> with and criticism of using WordPress software from an IndieWeb perspective.

* [https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2018/08/15/things-that-baffle-me-about-wordpress-in-2018/ Things that baffle me about WordPress in 2018] by [https://a.wholelottanothing.org/ Matt Haughey]

=== Complexity ===
The apparent complexity of using and maintaining WordPress has gotten bad enough (or people have gotten tired of it enough) to make people write plain HTML instead[https://twitter.com/psygnisfive/status/570787368158007296] <blockquote>@kevinmarks @t ive resorted to writing blog posts by hand (html and all!) because i hate wordpress. been looking into hakyll tho</blockquote>

=== Governance ===
WordPress uses a Benevolent Dictator for Life open source leadership model that puts the power in the hands of Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg creating a situation where company goals may overshadow the open source project.   
<blockquote>There’s been a lot more leaders, but I would actually argue the point that WordPress has always been sort of my vision being set, or even my direct leadership<cite> Matt Mullenweg [https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-on-gutenberg/ poststatus podcast]</cite></blockquote>

Any mention of alternative governance models gets a post removed from WordPress.org discussion board and may lead to a user being banned.
* <blockquote>Concerns have been raised about the posting of news about the WordPress Governance Project on make.wordpress.org and use of the #community-team Slack channel giving the impression the project is sanctioned as an official WordPress project. It has not received such sanctions from WordPress leadership.<cite>Francesca Marano  [https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/01/07/wordpress-governance-project-change-of-venue/ WordPress Governance Project]</cite></blockquote>
* Any discussion of ClassicPress, a fork of the Open source project, on WordPress.org forums is flagged or deleted.
<blockquote>I had my account at Wordpress.org banned merely for mentioning Classicpress in a post. (Ok, maybe not banned, just “disabled”) Someone had posted they would be looking for another blog platform, and I merely suggested Classicpress (not even linking to it) and my post was deleted and account disabled<cite>[https://forums.classicpress.net/t/banned-for-mentioning-classicpress/360 ClassicPress Forum]</cite></blockquote>

=== Jetpack Requires Login ===
<span id="Jetpack">[[Jetpack]]</span> is a popular plugin that incorporates a large number of features and services from WordPress.com into a self-hosted WordPress site. 

The plugin requires a WordPress.com login. While the service provided, such as their stats service, would require a login, many of the plugin features, such as infinite scroll, contact form, etc do not. But to use any of the features, you must log in.

Jetpack is also an [https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack open source project]. There have been attempts in the past to write a Jetpack plugin that does not require Wordpress.com but none are currently maintained.

=== Security and Maintenance Vulnerability ===
{{main|WordPress/Security}}

Like any system with widespread adoption, WordPress is a target. It is important to keep your site updated with the latest version of the software and any plugins. WordPress has a limited automatic update system.

=== Fatal Error memory exhausted ===
{{main|PHP#Fatal_error_memory_exhausted}}
WordPress fails to catch and handle fatal errors like running out of memory, and this results in a poor UX on real world sites, that leak otherwise private server configuration information like WordPress install path, potentially account username etc. e.g.:
* http://yottabytes.info/?p=10497 (on 2014-06-08 15:28 EDT): <blockquote> Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 41943040 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 32 bytes) in /home/johnkrol/public_html/wp-includes/post.php on line 1961</blockquote>

Criticism:
* {{cweiske}}: [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/php-memory-exhausted.htm PHP: Allowed memory size exhausted] ”… nonsense to list a server configuration … ”
** {{t}}: This is not just a "server configuration" issue. This is a failure by WordPress to catch / handle the exception, although it is not unique to WordPress (see the below linked PHP issue), and a vulnerability that anyone considering WordPress should be aware of.

See: [[PHP#Fatal_error_memory_exhausted|PHP: Fatal Error memory exhausted]] for more details.

=== Pages can not have numeric slugs ===
WordPress does not allow numeric page slugs, making it difficult to set up pages representing a year, such as <code>/event/2014/</code>. This is frustrating if you need to set up a series of annually recurring pages (not blog posts) without using a plugin. [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11917]

== WordPress.com hosting service ==
{{main|WordPress.com}}
WordPress.com is a blog hosting service that runs the WordPress open source software.
