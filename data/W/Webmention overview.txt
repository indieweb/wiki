'''<dfn>Webmention overview</dfn>''' is a primer on what [[webmention]] is and is written for the layperson as opposed to some of the more developer-forward pages in the wiki.

Note: This is meant as a temporary draft for potential, more logical inclusion into the larger pantheon of pages about [[webmention]]. It's also a potential draft for use on the [http://webmention.org webmention site] and as a result is currently more html forward than wiki-format forward. Diagrams are forthcoming, though others are encouraged to submit.


<h2>What are Webmentions?</h2>
By now most people are familiar with Twitter and the ubiquitous use of the <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14023" target="_blank">@ symbol in front of a username</a>. When sending a Tweet with an @username, the Twitter service sends a notification to the user's account that was mentioned in the tweet so that they know it was sent. For most, this is the way that one user communicates with other users on the platform.

Examples of @mentions:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I been smashed the idea of that album even existing. I got joints to roll <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest">@kanyewest</a></p>
— Wiz Khalifa (@wizkhalifa) <a href="https://twitter.com/wizkhalifa/status/692424370250186752">January 27, 2016</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Oh my days...time and time again you guys do it for us . Payno love ya bro. <a href="https://twitter.com/benwinston">@benwinston</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GabeTurner73">@GabeTurner73</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/bigboturner">@bigboturner</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Fulwell73">@Fulwell73</a></p>

Many other services also use this type of internal notification mechanism to indicate to other users that they have been mentioned or tagged in a post or a photograph. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/218027134882349" target="_blank">Facebook allows it</a>, <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1558367297777457" target="_blank">Instagram does</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/6320398?hl=en" target="_blank">Google+ does</a> (using a + instead of @), and even the longform article platform <a href="https://blog.medium.com/hey-ev-what-about-mentions-37aa9313e9d9#.qmzcs8f7h" target="_blank">Medium</a>, whose founder Ev Williams also co-founded Twitter, does too. Some people use the functionality for direct communication from person to person while others use it to tag friends in conversations or even in photos simply to let their friends and acquaintances know that they're being talked about.

In common social media parlance, these indicators or tags have been colloquially named @mentions (read "at mentions").

<h2>The Biggest Communications Problem on the Internet</h2>
The problem with these types of @mentions is that they only work within the social media silos which have chosen to build them into their systems, and even worse, they only work within that particular silo. Each social media silo views their service as a zero sum game. This means that they're worried that if you aren't using their system, then they're losing and another service is therefore winning. They're prioritizing keeping you tied into their system (so they can make money) over your ease of communication.

So for example, if you use Twitter, and your friend Alice only uses Facebook, and your friend Bob only uses his blog on WordPress, while your pal Chuck is over on Medium, one can't @mention one user from one platform to another. Thus you, Alice, Bob, and Chuck will find it impossible to communicate with each other unless you join the social media platforms that they're all on, and presuppose that those actually have that internal functionality for the types of use cases that you need it for. This may mean that the average person needs to be on 5 or more social media platforms to communicate with all their friends and acquaintances on the internet.

Given the issues of privacy, identity, or even different use cases, many people may not want to join multiple social networks to interact with their friends this way. They may not even be able to remember the usernames and passwords necessary to be on all these services, let alone have the time, effort, and inclination to keep up with them all. Why does it have to be so hard? Isn't the value of the internet the fact that it's interconnected?

Imagine how bothersome it would be if you could only make phone calls to your friends who had the same color telephone phone as you? If your phone is blue, then you can only call friends who have blue telephones and you're cut off from friends with green, red, yellow and puce telephones because you don't have a green, red, yellow, or puce telephone. Heidi, is your phone yellow-green, green-yellow, or is that chartreuse?

We all know that the massive benefit of the telephone system is that if you have service and a telephone, you can potentially reach anyone else in the network who has service and a telephone. Well, why, after over 20 years doesn't the web let us all have websites that work like this too? It manages to work this way with email, why couldn't it, why wouldn't it, why shouldn't it work from website to website?

In short, why can't you use Twitter to @mention Sally on Facebook, Bob on WordPress, Chuck on Medium, and expect that they'll all properly receive the message?

<h2>Some Brief Internet History</h2>
In the early days of the internet, before social media silos like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram rose to prominence, most people had their own websites and used them to post all of their media on their own site and owned all their own data. Blogs had comment boxes so that readers could post their replies. 

Interaction blossomed; it exploded. 

The internet was born.

The problem in those early days was that it was relatively difficult to own and maintain one's own website. Then in the mid-2000's companies like Facebook and Twitter began doing the building and maintenance of websites so that every day users could simply use them. Web 2.0 and social media dominated. While Facebook, Twitter, et al. gave their services away for free there were hidden costs: people no longer owned their own data; they were locked into these silos; they were limited with whom they could communicate; they were pressured to join services they didn't necessarily believe in to communicate with their friends or family; they gave up ownership and control of their content to major corporations which used it to profit themselves; they had to submit to advertising they might not want to see; and in short, they became the product.

Since then the internet has matured, content management systems have continued to flourish and mature. Now it's far easier and much less expensive to have your own domain name and manage your own website. But what about that inter-communication part that Facebook, Twitter, and others seem to have?

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<h3>Enter webmentions!</h3>
Webmention is a very simple and (now) standardized protocol that lets one website address (or URL) notify another website address that it has been mentioned on the internet. If both sites support the protocol, site A sends a webmention to site B, site B receives it and verifies that Site A sent it, and then Site B can optionally display the content of the page on Site A as an indicator that it was received.

An example: Alice has a website or blog where she writes an article about her rocket engine hobby. Bob has his own website where he writes a reply to Alice. In his reply, somewhere he includes the URL of Alice's article. When he publishes his reply, his site automatically sends a webmention to Alice, whose site receives it and verifies that Bob's site sent it. If she chooses she can then include the full text of Bob's reply along with his name, photo, and his URL (presuming he chooses to supply these) on her original post as a comment. Any new readers can then read her article and see Bob's reply.

The entire process is similar to traditional blog articles and comments (or if you prefer Facebook posts and comments, reposts, and likes, or Tweets and likes, retweets, or favorites, or Medium posts and responses.) The difference is that you have the ability to own your own content and it originates from a site you own, or at least a site you want to send it from.
<h3>What about Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Flickr, etc.?</h3>
The big question many will now have is do all these social media silos support Webmention? At present, they do not. And, being honest, some may never support it because they're using the fact that you're locked into their services to make money off of you and your content.

Fortunately most of the big services have open APIs (protocols that let outside services and applications interact with them). These protocols are what allow you to do things like cross post your SoundCloud audio to Facebook, or your marathon times from your FitBit to Twitter, or even your current weight from your bathroom scale to your Twitter account. This means that services can be built onto them that, in a sense, force them to support webmention until they choose to support it themselves.

One such application that currently does this for free is called <a href="http://brid.gy">Brid.gy</a>. You can post your status update, photo, or article to your own website and syndicate it (post copies of it) to services like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, and even Flickr. Bridgy will not only post to those services via webmention automatically, but it will watch that piece of content on each of those sites. When anyone likes, shares, or comments on them in those services, Bridgy will pick up that signal and send your site a webmention thereby notifying you of the interaction.

Then, if one of these social media silos gets shut down, and this<a href="https://indieweb.org/site-deaths" target="_blank"> happens far more often than you might think</a>, your site will still have all the commentary and discussion.
<h2>Where Can I Get Webmentions?</h2>
Okay, I <em>like the sound of this</em>! 

Where can <em>I</em> get it?! 

Where can I see it in action?

While the spec has just recently become a broad recommendation for use on the internet, there are already an <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention#Implementations" target="_blank">actively growing number of websites that support webmentions</a> either right out of the box or with simple plugins.

Content management systems like <a href="https://withknown.com/" target="_blank">WithKnown</a> have webmentions built right in, so you can create an account or download the opensource software and you're ready to go. If you know how to use Twitter or Facebook, you can use WithKnown.

If you've got a WordPress site, there's a simple <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/" target="_blank">Webmention plugin</a> that will allow you to begin using webmentions. Just download and activate. Other CMSes like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/vinculum" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/ProcessWire#Plugins" target="_blank">ProcessWire</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mapkyca/elgg-webmention" target="_blank">Elgg</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention" target="_blank">Nucleus CMS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jgarber623/craft-webmention-client" target="_blank">Craft</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirby-webmentions" target="_blank">Kirby</a> also have plugins that support the standard. 

More are coming every week.

<h3>What if my CMS of choice doesn't support it?</h3>
Are you on Tumblr, WordPress.com, Wix, SquareSpace, Ghost, Joomla, Magento, or any of the thousands of other content management or blogging systems? File support tickets asking them to support the new standard. It only takes a few days of work for a reasonable developer to build, and it greatly improves the value of the CMS to its users.

If you're a large corporation, even with modest means you can hire a developer to build it for your CMS and open source the solution as a plugin for others.

<h3>Are you a developer?</h3>
You can easily build support for webmentions on your own site pretty quickly. In addition to reading the spec, there are multiple implementations already written that you can use as examples. There are also lots of additional resources as well as pre-built services like <a href="https://webmention.io/" target="_blank">Webmention.io</a>, Telegraph, Jekmention, and others that can be leveraged. If you have problems or questions, feel free to join the IndieWeb chatroom online, via IRC, or even Slack to get hints, pointers, and additional resources for implementing a solution.

If your company allows 20% projects, take it on and build it for one or more platforms to spread the love and further democratize communication on the web.
