== IndieAuth and WebAuthn ==
WebAuthn can be used as the authentication during an [[IndieAuth]] flow. Similarly to how [https://oauth.net/webauthn/ WebAuthn doesn't replace the need for OAuth], WebAuthn doesn't replace the need for IndieAuth. WebAuthn takes the place of a password when authenticating to your account. In the context of IndieAuth, WebAuthn can be used as the way you log in to your own site, which then you can use with IndieAuth to log in to other sites.

You can implement them in either order, and implementing both is beneficial.
