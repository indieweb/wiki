== WhisperFollow ==
'''<dfn>[http://wordpress.org/plugins/whisperfollow/ WhisperFollow]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] based social [[reader]] create by [[User:acegiak.net|acegiak]] that currently supports [[h-entry]], [[RSS]], [[Atom]].

WhisperFollow aggregates feed data from sites in the users blogroll and presents them on a private page in a dashboard/wall format. MF2 parsing is attempted if no RSS/Atom feed is supplied. The plugin also allows the user to easily create new response posts to comment on, repost, or like these posts.

It relies on the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/ json-api plugin], the [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy indieweb-taxonomy plugin], [https://github.com/barnabywalters/php-mf-cleaner mf2 cleaner], and [https://github.com/stil/curl-easy curl-easy].
