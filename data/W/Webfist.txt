'''<dfn>Webfist</dfn>''' was software used to run a distributed fallback network to enable [[webfinger]] on email address from providers that do not yet support webfinger.  It was first implemented during the [[2013]] indiewebcamp.  More information could be found at the <nowiki>http://webfist.org</nowiki> (Webfist website, needs Internet Archive link).  

An overview of how it worked can also be found at Brett Slatkin's blog:
