'''<dfn>Webfist</dfn>''' was software used to run a distributed fallback network to enable [[webfinger]] on email address from providers that do not yet support webfinger.  It was first implemented during the [[2013]] IndieWebCamp. The <nowiki>http://webfist.org</nowiki> domain is not working as of 2023, but more information can be found on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130626211709/http://webfist.org/ archived site].

An overview of how it worked can also be found at Brett Slatkin's blog:
