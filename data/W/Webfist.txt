'''<dfn>Webfist</dfn>''' was software used to run a distributed fallback network to enable [[webfinger]] on email address from providers that do not yet support webfinger.  It was first implemented during the [[2013]] indiewebcamp.  More information could be found at the <nowiki>http://webfist.org</nowiki> (Webfist website, needs Internet Archive link).  

An overview of how it worked can also be found at [http://www.onebigfluke.com/2013/06/bootstrapping-webfinger-with-webfist.html Brett Slatkin's blog].  The brainstorming session page from 2013 also has links to some information: [[2013/WebFinger_Past_Present_Future]]
