'''<dfn>[https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131 WebmebtionDressing]</dfn>''' is an open source program by {{thedod}} to load [[Webmention]]s with javascript and display them in an iframe.

There is a [https://bl.ocks.org/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131 demo] that lets you view Webmentions of a specific page on this wiki (for example [https://bl.ocks.org/thedod/raw/78b14341e39ca0d09131/#WebmentionDressing ''this'' page]). The code can also be configured to show Webmentions of any other site using [[webmention.io]].

It can work on static sites (it's javascript) but not with javascript-disabled browers (for the same reason ;) ).

== How To ==
=== Embedding for sites using webmention.io ===
Edit ''SITE_ROOTS'' and ''DEMO_PATH'' at the top of [https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131#file-script-js script.js]  (as explained in the [https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131#file-readme-md README]).

You can then include an iframe with your own copy of WebmentionDressing (configured as explained above), and supply the current page's path as the URL's hash (e.g. ''#WebmentionDressing'' for [[WebmentionDressing|this page]] or ''#2014/Online'' for [[2014/Online]]).

=== Theming ===
To change the design (it doesn't have to be [[Bootstrap]]), edit the [https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html mustache] templates at the bottom of index.html [https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131#file-readme-md]. Of course, if you don't want it to be Bootstrap you'll also need to redesign the rest of the HTML :)

This was the original intention of WebmentionDressing: to create an easy platform for designers to try out various ideas of [[comments-presentation|comment presentation]].

=== Interactive theming ===
An earlier version of the template exists as a [http://codepen.io/thedod/pen/MYYOVN/left codepen]. This enables real-time tweaking of templates. Remember to click "fork" before you begin so that you can save your changes :). You can either login to codepen via github, or simply save an "anonymous fork" (if you don't intend to maintain it later).

=== Contributions are welcome ===
If you fork something nice (codepen, gist, or your own site), please let us know (e.g. post about it and webmention  [[WebmentionDressing|this page]] :)
