==Indieweb WordPress User Interviews==

'''Matt Hilton'''
[[Hilton Transcript]]

Matt is new to both WordPress and the IndieWeb. He learned about IndieWeb by someone sharing a link to micro.blog/ From there he learned about the wiki and WordPress integration. Having used Wordpress in the past Matt decided he wanted to own his domain and moved to WordPress. 

He tried out Independent Publisher as a theme but expressed a desire for 2017. Matt wished there was a better way to know what themes worked with what plug-ins.

Matt ended up adding rel=me links manually rather than through the plug-ins because he did not know the plug-ins did that and did not want to change his general settings page once it was set. When learning about how to change the header or footer in WordPress Matt learned about Child themes and realized he needed to that first. 

Matt added an h-card to his homepage after trying out indiewebify.me and realized one was missing. I did not ask if he used the widget in the interview. In a follow up question posted to IRC Matt said he hard coded the h-card into his footer and did not realize there was widget for this until today.

'''Cathie LeBlanc'''
Cathie is a professor of media studies at Plymouth State University she heard about indieweb on Twitter. She wrote about her journey here: https://cathieleblancblog.com/2018/04/24/surveillance-capitalism-and-indieweb/. Cathie noted that she has always been interested in OER and Open Pedagogy. She has blogged for over ten years and self hosted for a few. She started by installing the Indiewweb plug-in. Following those directions she edited the profile to make rel=me links but decided to hard code them for some reason in a header and footer. Something wasn't working but she can't remember. Cathie noted she was looking for something like Bridgy for years. Cathie got tripped up by the http https differences using IndieAuth but while diagnosing the problem she couldn't understand the "why" behind IndieAuth. What was gained? Cathie tried it any ways because she figured if the community recommended it it must be the right thing to do. She then discussed how for a new user the lack of a mental model was the hardest part to understand. It was hard to use the getting-started page of the wiki to investigate since the wiki has no taxonomy.
