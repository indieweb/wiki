==Indieweb WordPress User Interviews==

'''Matt Hilton'''

Matt is new to both WordPress and the IndieWeb. He learned about IndieWeb by someone sharing a link to micro.blog/ From there he learned about the wiki and WordPress integration. Having used Wordpress in the past Matt decided he wanted to own his domain and moved to WordPress. 

He tried out Independent Publisher as a theme but expressed a desire for 2017. Matt wished there was a better way to know what themes worked with what plug-ins.

Matt ended up adding rel=me links manually rather than through the plug-ins because he did not know the plug-ins did that and did not want to change his general settings page once it was set. When learning about how to change the header or footer in WordPress Matt learned about Child themes and realized he needed to that first. 

Matt added an h-card to his homepage after trying out indiewebify.me and realized one was missing. I did not ask if he used the widget in the interview.

In this video I show how to enable IndieAuth after the 2.0.1
==Recommended Changes==
* Align the content in Wordpress-Getting Started wiki page and the Version 3.3.7  of Indieweb documentation
* Just focus the getting started page on the steps and not the underlying technology and philosophies
* Figure out why you can't search for the two indieweb compatible themes
* Remove theme discussion from Getting Started Page. You need to keep users focused on the workflow.
 too many will end up theme hunting. 
* Add a description of rel=me to getting started page
* Add a description of h-card to getting started page
* Add a description of h-entry to getting started page
