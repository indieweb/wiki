'''<dfn>WordPress Frequently Asked Questions</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>WordPress FAQ</dfn>''' are frequently asked questions encountered when using [[WordPress]] to run one's personal website.

We've documented some FAQ related to the overlap of IndieWeb and WordPress below. While many of these questions may be answered elsewhere in the wiki, these are some of the more common stumbling blocks people may come across, and thus may also be entry points for improving pieces for the future.


== Spam ==
<strong>Q.</strong> I set WordPress to need comment approval unless one had previously been approved, yet for some reason it isn’t recognising previously-approved commenters, so I’m having to approve them all by hand.

<strong>A.</strong> Part of WordPress's built-in comment approval and anti-spam mechanism works by checking against the email field as input by a user when making a comment. Since Webmention doesn't require an email address field for sending a comment, it skirts around WordPress's traditional approval system and as a result webmentions may be marked for moderation or, if Akismet is installed, as spam as a result.

== Avatar syndicated to Twitter ==
<strong>Q.</strong> I'm using the [[Bridgy Publish plugin]] or [[Bridgy]] to syndicate my status updates to Twitter and I'm getting the tweet across properly, but it's adding a copy of my Gravatar/avatar as a separate photo to the post. How can I fix this?

<strong>A.</strong> Some themes and/or plugins may be adding a u-photo on your [[Gravatar]] or other avatar without nesting it into an [[h-card]]. As a result, Brid.gy [https://brid.gy/about/#microformats thinks you're attempting to send a photo] to Twitter as well. You'll need to track down where the errant u-photo microformat is coming from and either remove it or nest it properly within your h-card to get the syndicated result you desire.
