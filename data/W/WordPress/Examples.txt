** Has moved her primary domain/[[identity]] over to Crystalbeasley.com which is statically generated.

=== Past Examples ===
Folks have opted to switch away from WordPress for various reasons (e.g. problems noted above).  They seem to switch to one of three options, one indieweb, and two silo.

* static site generator or some other IndieWeb [[project]]
* silo: [[WordPress.com]] hosting service (see below)
* other silo: e.g. [[Tumblr]] (others?)

==== Switched to another project ====
There are many folks with personal sites that have kept their personal site and webhost, but switched away from WordPress to another solution, e.g. typically a static site generator:
* [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] switched from WordPress for his blog to using [[p3k]] to post [[articles]] on Aaronparecki.com

* 2013-11-10 Julie Pagano to [[Middleman]] (http://middlemanapp.com/) : http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/11/10/site-redesign-using-middleman/

* [[User:petermolnar.eu|Peter Molnar]] used WordPress on [https://petermolnar.eu petermolnar.eu] from 2007-1016 before moving to a static site generator.
Many others have switched to Jekyll or are in the process of doing so, e.g.:
* Crystal Beasley - per recent (2013-11) conversation on IRC

* [[User:Willnorris.com|Will Norris]] on [http://willnorris.com willnorris.com] (2005 - [https://willnorris.com/2014/07/one-step-forward-two-steps-back July 2014]) with:
** URL Shortener via WP-Hum ([[selfdogfooding]])

* [https://josephboyle.net Joseph Boyle] (down as of 2013-10-25)
*Folks that were on WordPress that have moved to Tumblr
** Micki Krimmel
** ...

* others beforehand ...
