__TOC__

== WordPress Directory IndieWeb Plugins ==
The WordPress Plugin Directory has several IndieWeb plugins.
* https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/indieweb/
In general, if a plugin has been updated within the past two years, it should be compatible with the latest version of WordPress. If a plugin older than two years, it should be avoided.

Start with:
* Install the '''[https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ IndieWeb Plugin for WordPress]''' 
This plugin helps you establish your IndieWeb identity by extending the user profile to provide [[rel-me]] and [[h-card]] fields and optionally adding widgets to display an hcard on your sidebar.

The IndieWeb plugin also includes a bundled installer for a core set of IndieWeb-related plugins and a dashboard menu for settings of plugins you activate. Additional plugins on the extensions tab of the menu include: [[Wordpress Webmention Plugin]], [[Semantic Linkbacks]], [[WordPress Micropub Plugin]], [[Post Kinds Plugin]], [[Syndication Links]], [[Bridgy_Publish_plugin|WordPress Bridgy Plugin]], [[Wordpress IndieAuth Plugin|WordPress IndieAuth Plugin]], [[WordPress Microformats2 Plugin]], [[Simple_Location|Simple Location]], and [[WebSub#WordPress_Plugins_for_PuSH|WordPress WebSub Plugins]].

== Plugins by feature ==
Plugins are categorized by the functionality they bring to the IndieWeb WordPress community 

=== Webmention Support ===
[[File:semantic-linkbacks.png|100px|right]]
[[Webmention]]s are also part of the core IndieWeb [[building-blocks]]. They let you send and receive replies, likes, etc. directly from your site.

To add webmention support to your WordPress site:
* Install the '''[[Webmention Plugin]]'''
To further enhance webmentions:
* Also install the '''[[Semantic Linkbacks]]''' plugin. This adds support for richer  [[comments]] (including the [[likes]], [[reposts]], [[favorites]], [[RSVPs]] and classic [[mentions]].

==== alternatives ====
[https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] provides an async alternative webmention sender/receiver, using WP Cron for both, but it's yet to see a stable release. It also doesn't do any comment formatting.

=== Kinds of Posts ===
WordPress supports several different ways of organizing data. To support different kinds of posts, you can try the [[Post Kinds Plugin]].

The Post Kinds adds a taxonomy to the post type in Wordpress allow for posts to be classified as a reply/like/repost etc. This allows archives to be generated for these kinds of posts as well as support to add the appropriate markup.

=== Publishing to Your Site ===
[[Micropub for WordPress]] implements a [[Micropub]] server endpoint.

=== POSSE Plugins ===
Along with [[personal-domain]]s, <span id="POSS">[[POSSE]]</span> is one of the cornerstones of the IndieWeb. In short, instead of posting to social network [[silos]], you post to your own site and then copy to the silos.

You can [[POSSE]] manually, but most people automate it. WordPress has many plugins that do this. A few of the most popular are found below.

==== Multi silo plugins ====
These plugins have the ability to target multiple silos simultaneously:
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/bridgy-publish/ Bridgy publish]
** Requires proper mf2 in one's theme
** [https://brid.gy/about#publishing Helpful information about formatting for control of POSSE output]
** POSSE destinations include Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr
* [http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/ Jetpack Publicize]
** This is the simplest and easiest method, but the results are very simple and don't provide as much control over what is posted compared to other options
** POSSE destinations include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Google+, and Path
** JetPack Premium also has a [https://jetpack.com/2017/02/22/share-it-again-new-social-media-features-for-premium-and-professional-customers/ "Share it Again"] feature for paid subscribers.
* [http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wordpress/ NextScripts SNAP] aka [[SNAP]]
** This has a more complicated setup and requires creating API keys for the used services, but it's both well documented with step by step instructions and allows for the most control over what is syndicated
** POSSE destinations include Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Flickr, Medium, Tumblr, and more than 20 other common social media sites
* [[Quickposse]] 
** POSSE destinations include [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Instagram]]
** {{acegiak}} is [[selfdogfood|selfdogfooding]] this plugin
* [http://ifttt.com/ IFTTT] (If This, Then That) 
** [[User:Techlifeweb.com|Scott Kingery]] has [http://techlifeweb.com/using-wordpress-for-indieweb/#posse documented some of how he uses IFTTT].

==== Single silo plugins ====
These plugins focus on POSSE to only one target [[silo]] each:
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/tumblr-crosspostr/ Tumblr Crosspostr] (Tumblr only, supports [[rel-syndication]])
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/Diasposter/ Diasposter] (Diaspora* only, supports [[rel-syndication]])
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost/ WP-Crosspost] (WordPress-to-WordPress only, supports [[rel-syndication]])
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/medium/ Medium] - Official Medium Plugin. Might be worth trying.

==== rel-syndication ====
If you POSSE, it's good practice to include [[rel-syndication]] links on your WordPress posts. 

The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/ Syndication Links] plugin is designed to support both manual and automatic entry of [[rel-syndication]] links. It is extensible to add support for plugins and has support from Tumblr Crosspostr, Diaposter, Medium, and WP-Crosspost, as well as having integrated support courtesy of rel-syndication plugin for [[SNAP]], Bridgy Publish, and Social.

Also, if you are writing status updates that will be duplicated in the content share boxes in your edit post screen, there is some handy code [http://davidpeach.co.uk/autofill-share-fields-for-status-posts/ here] to autofill those share fields to save copy/pasting them from the content WYSIWYG.

If you also want to go the other direction and pull your social network posts and data back to WordPress, there are [[PESOS]] plugins too. To start, try [http://www.enthropia.com/labs/wp-lifestream/ Lifestream].

=== PESOS Plugins ===
In case [[POSSE]] is not available - for example, due to API limitations like in case of Instagram - there is always the option to pull in your data from other hosts using [[PESOS]]

* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-social-importers/ Keyring Social Importers] - an impressive importer with auto-import functionality and with an easily extendable setup on top of the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/ Keyring] plugin. Currently supported networks: 
** Delicious
** Flickr
** Foursquare
** Instagram
** Instapaper
** TripIt
** Twitter
** ... and anything you can build on top of this and the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/ Keyring] plugin, for example, [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring 500px is added as a service to Keyring in a github repository].
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/dsgnwrks-twitter-importer/ DsgnWrks Instagram Importer] - for Instagram
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/dsgnwrks-twitter-importer/ DsgnWrks Twitter Importer] - for Twitter
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/ozh-tweet-archiver/ Ozh' Tweet Archiver] - for Twitter (Separately available on [https://github.com/ozh/ozh-tweet-archiver GitHub] with scripts [https://gist.github.com/ozh/11166845 .csv] [https://gist.github.com/ozh/f5deafcffd8d271bfa92 JSON] for importing more than 3200 Tweets imposed by Twitter API; it also has a custom "Twitter" [https://github.com/ozh/ozh-tweet-archive-theme theme available]; for additional support and instructions see these two blogposts: [http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/ozh-tweet-archiver-backup-twitter-with-wordpress/ 1] [http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/import-and-archive-your-tweets-with-wordpress--cms-22656 2]
* [http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/ FeedWordPress] allows one to use RSS feeds of sites to import content and display it on a WordPress site giving attribution to the original piece of content. Used in this way, it could be considered a "poor man's PESOS."
* [https://www.integromat.com/en/integrations/wordpress Integromat] appears to be a PESOS service, similar to [[IFTTT]], that can be used with WordPress

=== Authentication ===

In order to use your own domain name to sign into other websites, you will want to add support for [[IndieAuth]]. This requires [http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ IndieAuth for Wordpress].

The plugin also supports [[web sign-in]], allowing you to sign into your own site using an external endpoint.

==== Alternatives ====

Install the '''[http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ IndieWeb plugin]''' to add rel-me links to your WordPress site! This will allow you to login using sites that support [[relmeauth]].

Once you have rel-me links set up, head over to [https://indieauth.com/ indieauth.com] and sign in to test that you've set things up appropriately!

If you don't want to add a plugin, you can follow the instructions for [http://en.support.wordpress.com/add-social-media-buttons-to-your-sidebar-or-footer/ adding social media buttons] or the documentation for [http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets#Using_Text_Widgets using text widgets]. You can also add [[rel-me]] links to a custom menu by enabling the Link Relationships under Screen Options on the custom menu page.

More details for setting up rel-me links can be found at https://indieauth.com/setup.

=== Backfeed ===
Even if you're POSSEing or you're adding manual syndication urls ( for example, with [https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/ Syndication Links] plugin ) you probably want to pull comments and likes on the social network posts back to your site. This is called [[backfeed]]. 

Some of the POSSE plugins have built-in functionality to do this for some networks.

'''Other options:'''

* [[Bridgy]] - another option is [[Bridgy]], a service that automatically sends [[webmention]]s for activity on your POSSEd posts inside [[silos]] (before starting to use Bridgy, make sure you first install the webmention and semantic-linkbacks plugins described below).
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-reactions-importer/ Keyring Reactions Importer] - a generic, extendable plugin in early stage, on top of the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring Keyring] plugin. It can auto-imports reactions for every post with syndicated links ( see readme of the plugin ) by polling, based on chained scheduled wp-cron events, so it may become heavy. Currently supported networks:
** Facebook - comments & likes
** Flickr - favorites & comments
** 500px - likes, favorites, comments - requires [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring/blob/master/includes/services/extended/500px.php an additional worker for Keyring] )
** Instagram - comments & likes
** ... and anything you add

=== Reader / follower plugins ===
* [[PressForward]] a relatively full featured [[reader]] that is also useful for archiving and reposting
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/blogroll2email/ blogrol2email] - a combined [[RSS]] and [[microformats]] reader that uses the (slightly forgotten and abandoned) [https://en.support.wordpress.com/blogroll/ Blogroll] section of WordPress as source and PHP Mf2 parser from [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]].
* [[WhisperFollow| Whisperfollow for feed aggregation]]
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedwordpress/ FeedWordPress] or [http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/ see also]
* [https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/reader/ WPMUDEV Reader] (requires subscription, meant for WP multi-site use)

== Other Indieweb Plugins ==
Here are a few more plugins you might want to try. Many require FTP or other more technical setup.
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/hum/ URL Shortener: WP-Hum]
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webactions WebActions]
* [https://gist.github.com/pfefferle/1724438 blavatars (icons)]

* [[WordPress uf2]]
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/aperture/ Aperture] - signs you up with an account on [[Aperture]] automatically, so that you can use [[Microsub]] apps
