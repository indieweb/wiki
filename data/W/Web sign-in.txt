{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/web_sign-in Web sign-in]</dfn>''' is signing in to websites using your personal web address (without having to use your e-mail address). Web sign-in provides a simpler replacement for [[OpenID]].

== Why ==
{{main|Why web sign-in}}
Web sign-in is much simpler to use and implement than previous methods of signing in with your own domain like [[OpenID]]. 

Using your own domain is safer than a 3rd party email service, and simpler than email on your own domain.

See [[Why web sign-in]] for more reasons why you should use it.

== How to ==
{{main|How to set up web sign-in on your own domain}}

== Details ==
A site or service that that supports web sign-in provides the following user experience (UX): 
# sign-in or login link, that when clicked goes to or reveals #2
# text field for entering a web address (can be its own page or part of a drop down dialog) that when submitted does #3
# verifies the user has control of that domain (e.g. via [[RelMeAuth]], [[IndieAuth]], or by calling a service that does one, both, or more)
# visual indication that someone is signed-in
# a sign-out or logout link, that when clicked clears out any login state and goes to #1

Web sign-in does not require any specific protocol, though typical web sign-in UX may support one or more of:
* [[RelMeAuth]]
* [[IndieAuth]]
* ... others?
And in addition to at least one of those, may direct silo-specific profile URLs (e.g. twitter.com/username) to silo-specific sign-in (e.g. [https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/guides/log-in-with-twitter sign-in with Twitter])

See [[web-sign-in-protocol]] for a more detailed example of Web sign-in, or http://microformats.org/wiki/web_sign-in.

A web sign-in UX MUST not require Javascript in order to function, though it may use [[progressive enhancement]] for a smoother UX.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of IndieWeb sites that support Web Sign-in:
=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} supports Web Sign-in on seblog.nl to show
* [[private]] / limited [[audience]] posts (via a "/private" new nav item that appears when signed in)
* signed-in only posts (e.g. [[checkin]] posts) on the home page [[stream]] (as well as the ability to click and view the permalinks of those posts)
* when seblog.nl is signed-in in particular:
** [[homepage mentions]] listed on a separate page (/messenger)

=== David Somers ===
{{omz13}} supports it at [[https://toolbox.imoxia.com toolbox]] which requests the users domain name, does some discovery, then primarily initiates [[IndieAuth]] login to grant access. If the browser supports JavaScript the UI is slightly smother than when operating in a no JavaScript environment.

== Implementations ==
* [[indielogin.com]] - implements web sign-in via [[RelMeAuth]], [[IndieAuth]], [[email]] and [[PGP]]
* [[IndieAuth.com]] - an implementation of Web sign-in and [[RelMeAuth]]
* [http://github.com/themattharris/relmeauth relmeauth PHP library] - open source
* [https://github.com/ptarjan/relmeauth relmeauth Python library] - open source
* [http://git.cweiske.de/indieauth-openid.git/blob/HEAD:/README.rst IndieAuth-OpenID] [[User:cweiske.de|cweiske]]'s open source IndieAuth to OpenID proxy
See http://microformats.org/wiki/relmeauth#open_source_implementations for more.
