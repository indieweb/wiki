'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/web_sign-in Web sign-in]</dfn>''' is signing in to websites using your personal web address (without having to use your e-mail address). Web sign-in supersedes [[OpenID]].

== Why ==
{{main|Why web sign-in}}
Web sign-in is much simpler to use and implement than previous methods of signing in with your own domain like [[OpenID]]. 

Using your own domain is safer than a 3rd party email service, and simpler than email on your own domain.

See [[Why web sign-in]] for more reasons why you should use it.

== Details ==
See [[web-sign-in-protocol]] for a more detailed description of Web sign-in, or http://microformats.org/wiki/web_sign-in.
