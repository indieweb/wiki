''WikiSuiteâ„¢'' is the most comprehensive and integrated Free / Libre / Open Source software suite ever developed. WikiSuite is especially suited to knowledge-centric organizations and offers most (80%+) of the data and information management features all organizations need, such as: Email, Website & Blog, Shopping Cart, Intranet & Project Management, E-learning, Social Networking, Knowledge base, File sharing, Issue Tracker, Video-conferencing, LDAP, VPN, Gateway, Network, etc.

You can install anywhere (home, office, laptop, data center, etc.)

The main web component of ''WikiSuite'' is ''Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware'': A full-featured, Free / Libre / Open Source, all-in-one Wiki+CMS+Groupware. PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, Zend Framework, jQuery, Smarty and Bootstrap.

''Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware'' runs on shared hosting and has pretty much all the features you could ever need for your personal site. As of 2016-12-08, it doesn't have IndieWeb features (h-card, rel-me), but those can be added as built-in (but optional) features. Not those pesky extensions that just break at the next upgrades (see http://pluginproblems.com/). The [https://profiles.tiki.org/Personal_Blog_and_Profile_12x Personal Site Profile] could be improved to by default support all IndieWeb features. -> https://dev.tiki.org/IndieWeb

While ''WikiSuite'' is designed for organizations, nothing prevents you from using it for just one person! Beyond your domain name, you'll want email, calendar, XMPP, etc.

WikiSuite is the 1st (and as of 2016-12-08, the only) FLOSS alternative to G Suite, Office 365 Enterprise E5 and Zoho Office Suite listed on Prism Break: https://prism-break.org/en/subcategories/servers-enterprise-suite/

Even if you don't want a full suite (yet or ever!), you should check out the list of awesome components:

The IndieWeb philosophy fits right in with WikiSuite, and thus, has been added a component criteria:
