== Features ==

* https://tiki.org/article374-Tiki-Passes-1-Million-Downloads

''Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware'' runs on shared hosting and supports personal site features.

While ''WikiSuite'' is designed for organizations, nothing prevents you from using it for just one person! Beyond your domain name, you'll want email, calendar, XMPP, etc.

WikiSuite is the 1st (and as of 2016-12-08, the only) FLOSS alternative to G Suite, Office 365 Enterprise E5 and Zoho Office Suite listed on Prism Break: https://prism-break.org/en/subcategories/servers-enterprise-suite/

Even if you don't want a full suite (yet or ever!), you should check out the list of awesome components:

== IndieWeb Friendly ==
As of 2016-12-08, it doesn't have IndieWeb features (h-card, rel-me), but those can be added as built-in (but optional) features. Not those pesky extensions that just break at the next upgrades (see http://pluginproblems.com/). 

The [https://profiles.tiki.org/Personal_Blog_and_Profile_12x Personal Site Profile] could be improved to by default support all IndieWeb features. -> https://dev.tiki.org/IndieWeb

== Get Involved ==
The IndieWeb philosophy fits right in with WikiSuite, and thus, has been added a component criteria:

Please get involved with ''WikiSuite'' so it can become an even better tool for anyone to easily manage their own data and join the IndieWeb!
