{{stub}}

'''<dfn>WET</dfn>''' is an acronym for Write Everything Twice (or Thrice) or We Enjoy Typing, where formats or architectures encourage the duplication (triplication etc) of information, introducing increasing likelihood of inconsistencies, like in [[sidefile]]s and meta tags like [[OGP]] or [[Twitter Cards]]. WET is the opposite of [[DRY]].
