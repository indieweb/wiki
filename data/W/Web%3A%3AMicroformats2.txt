<span class="p-summary">Web::Microformats2 is a [[microformats2]] parsing library for the Perl programming language</span>, developed by {{jmac}}. It is free and open-source software, and is available through [https://www.cpan.org the CPAN].

[https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Microformats2 Its page on MetaCPAN] contains more information about the library, including API documentation and usage examples. (The module is pronounced "Web Microformats 2" -- the colon-colon being a silent Perlish naming convention.)

As of July 2018, its parser implementation is more or less complete, passing all of [https://github.com/microformats/tests the current suite of Microformats v2 tests]. It works well enough to power [[Web::Mention]].
