Web::Microformats2 is a [[microformats2]] parsing library for the Perl 5 programming language, developed by {{jmac}}. It is free and open-source software, and is available through [https://www.cpan.org the CPAN].

[https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Microformats2 Its page on MetaCPAN] contains more information about the library, including API documentation and usage examples.

As of May 2018, its implementation is incomplete (in particular, it does not wholly support MF2's datetime format), but it works well enough to power [[Web::Mention]]. (So long as you aren't very picky about dates and times, anyway...)
