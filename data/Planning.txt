== Help Out ==
Want to help out with one of those? Say something in [[IRC]] and add yourself to the page.

{{gwg}} is willing to help out with an Indiewebcamp, providing support and planning to the extent possible. This would include some volunteering. Depends on what is needed and when and is willing to try to work with anyone who needs help in the Northeastern United States, and possibly farther afield if sufficient notice.

== Organize ==
Want to organize a 2016 [[IndieWebCamp]] in your town and don't see it above?

Start with:
# Find at least one committed co-organizer. This is the most important step.
# Add a link above to <nowiki>[[2016/YourCity]]</nowiki>

=== FAQ ===
==== Creator camp not a hackathon ====
Q: Is IndieWebCamp a hackathon?

A: IndieWebCamps are creator camps focused on helping everyone develop, grow, and advance their personal indieweb presence.

The term "hackathon" has become to mean some sort of short term event where a group of people come up with a typically new project to develop just for the sake of the hackathon, often in a competitive environment, and often for prizes donated by one or more sponsors.

IndieWebCamp resembles that only in the aspect of group collaboration.
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on and improve your existing personal site, not just a new site (unless you need a new site!)
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on your personal site in a way that encourages [[longevity]] and your personal use beyond the camp itself.
* IndieWebCamp focuses on collaboration instead of competition. There are all sorts of different experts at IndieWebCamp and we do our best to both ask questions of each other and help each other!
* The prize(s) you win at IndieWebCamp are your own improved personal website, hopefully with new features you can then use day-to-day after the camp has completed!

As we do "hack" on stuff (our own websites), IndieWebCamps do have a "hack day" component of it, but certainly not "hackathon" in the commonly understood "corporate hackathon" sense.

== Past Planning Notes ==
=== New York City ===
2016-01 IndieWebCamp NYC.
* Mozilla NYC is a very doable weekend venue (8-15 people, several breakout rooms)
* Interested:
** {{t}}
** {{bear}}
** {{jedahan}}
** ...
* co-organizers: ...
** {{t}} can help co-organize and be the Mozilla connection to help with hosting
** {{gwg}} willing to try to work with anyone who needs help in the Northeastern United States, and possibly farther afield if sufficient notice.
** ...
* ...

Some date constraints:
* weekends are preferable
* I ({{t}}) can get in-office help thru end of February 2016 for Moz NYC venue, not necessarily after.
* FSa work better for {{gwg}} so we're considering those dates first. But he has nothing scheduled for January/February weekends and would accept any.

Possible dates: (all are Friday…Saturday) Please add your ** +1/0/-1 signature preferences!
* Anything in January or February works for me!
** ...

==== MIT ====
2016-03 [[2016/MIT]]

* 03-13…14 SuMo IWC before W3C Social Web WG f2f
** -1 {{benthatmustbeme}} Commuter Rail won't get me in until the afternoon on sundays
* '''03-14…15 MoTu IWC right before W3C Social Web WG f2f is 03-16…17''' (VENUE CONFIRMED!)
** +1 {{benthatmustbeme}} This worked out well last year
** +1 {{t}} 03-14 is Gregorian pi day, and we can get lots of stuff working to demo at Social Web WG
** +1 {{rabbit}} This works for me. Should I bring pie for pi day?
** +1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1 Cassie (sensible.mn and cassie.wtf) I'll be in town again for Libreplanet, so this would be perfect!

** +1 {{gwg}} for Friday and Saturday
** +1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1 {{t}} this works for me too, thought it does overlap one day with Libreplanet
* note: 03-19…20 [https://www.libreplanet.org/2016/ Libreplanet]

=== Nuremberg ===
2016-04-16..17 [[2016/Nuremberg]]
* co-organized by {{jkphl}} and his team, looking for additional co-organizers
* +1 {{aaronpk}} can help with event but not local logistics

==== Summit ====
2016-06-?? Annual [[2016|IndieWeb Summit]] (in Portland ESRI R&D and likely Brighton? other cities)
* interested
** {{t}} definitely
** {{gRegor}} definitely
** {{aaronpk}} definitely
** ...

** Social Web Working Group f2f (to be planned, likely also hosted by ESRI R&D)

Possible dates:
* 2016-06-04..05
** +1 {{t}} currently I can make this, though June is filling up quick, would prefer locking down *a* date sooner rather than later.
** +1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1 {{gRegor}} works for me currently.
** ...

Topics:
* update [[why]] definition, header to focus on the positive rather than be a reaction to silos.

=== HWC 2016 ===
<span id="HWC">2016 [[Homebrew Website Club]]</span> start date! Should we start the 2016 HWC meetups on:
* <s>2016-01-06 only one week after 2015-12-30, </s>
** but avoids having a meetup land the day before US Thanksgiving
** 0 {{t}} ok with this. no longer any preference.
** 0 {{gRegor}} OK with this. Not attending an HWC currently so does not impact me.
* '''2016-01-13 two weeks after 2015-12-30''', 
** but collides with Wednesday before US Thanksgiving thus unlikely to have much (any) participation at US venues.
** 0 {{t}} ok with this.

Based on lack of strong input on this, we are going with the default continuing every two weeks from 2015-12-30 and '''starting 2016 HWC with 2016-01-13.''' - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 14:56, 23 December 2015 (PST) (updated, no objections, going with this plan. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 07:51, 31 December 2015 (PST))
