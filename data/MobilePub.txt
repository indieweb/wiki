'''<dfn>MobilePub</dfn>''' is a mobile app for posting text, links, photos, videos, and audio files to your website using [[micropub]]. MobilePub was built with Apache Cordova and is available on [https://github.com/dissolve/mobilepub GitHub]


===Current Features===
* Built on Apache Cordova to keep the development simple and cross platform.
* Open Source
* Polls micropub for supported syndication targets
* Photo upload
* Video upload
* Audio upload
* Detect offline status and queue posts to send when online
* Save posts to submit later

===TODO===
* User interface design (there is not a lot of space to work with so I want to fully figure out they layout)
* Post types (<s>checkin</s>, <s>bookmark</s>, <s>like</s>, <s>reply</s>, rsvp, etc.)
* Save and recall unfinished posts
* Poll a list of recent webmentions (Ideally be able to register for push notifications from the site)
* Track GPS stream (coordinates of a run/walk/drive)
* Builds for other systems (should be easy for anyone with build environment)

===DOWNLOAD===
Currently there are downloads for the latest builds on Adobe PhoneGap Build service (only for Android and Windows Phone)
[https://build.phonegap.com/apps/1261335/builds MobilePub PhoneGapBuild Page]

You can also download the latest code from the git repo from [https://github.com/dissolve/mobilepub My Github Archive]
To build this, I would recommend just following the cordova tutorials.
