{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Markdown</dfn>''' is a way of writing and interpreting plain text so that it can optionally be converted to more explicitly meaningful or richly styled text (e.g. HTML). Markdown is often used in README files and some online discussion forums.

== Principles ==
=== Readability ===
As readable as possible is the most important Markdown design goal.[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/] <blockquote>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.</blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Indieweb participants using markdown on their personal site, for authoring text [[posts]] (e.g. [[notes]], [[articles]]), editing text, and sometimes publishing / syndicating text.

See and incorporate from [[storage#Markdown_plus_extensions]]

* [[User:Sandeep.io]] writes in markdown and publishes it directly in a hidden div. It is intended as lossless, plaintext content for comments and replies [http://www.sandeep.io/44 since 2013-06-11][http://www.sandeep.io/48]
* {{rhiaro}} uses markdown for post authoring and storage [http://rhiaro.co.uk/2013/10/metadata-parsing since 2013-10-13]. E.g.
** http://rhiaro.co.uk/posts/150403-2255_MicropubTest.md
* {{bret}} uses markdown for post authoring and storage since ????-??-?? E.g.
** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/master/_posts/quill.p3k.io/2015-03-28-173-of-unreleased-ap.md

* {{bear}} uses markdown for [[articles]], small [[notes]] and [[webmention]]'s to keep his markdown "clean" each type of article is handled by a specific Jinja2 template. Since ????-??-?? (URL to MD source?)
* {{aaronpk}} uses markdown for post authoring and storage since ????-??-?? (URL to MD source?)

== Dialects ==
Markdown comes in many flavors...

* basic Gruber Markdown
* Github-Flavored Markdown
* StackOverflow Markdown
* MultiMarkdown
* [https://rawgit.com/converspace/markaround/master/README.html Markaround]
* kramdown (basic plus some extensions from PHP Markdown and Maruku)
* ...

And has many extensions to the basic syntax:
* [http://maruku.rubyforge.org/proposal.html Meta-data syntax implemented by Maruku]

== Criticism ==
=== Not pretty ===
readable but not pretty - aaronpk in IRC

sometimes looks funny - bret in IRC

if it looks funny, it's failed as markdown [per its own overriding readability principle] - tantek in IRC

=== Underspecified ===
* Under-specified, leads to many implementations, fragmentation. e.g.,

GitHub-Flavored Markdown

<code><pre>
```php
code sample
```
</pre></code>

vs. kramdown

<code><pre>
~~~~php
code sample
~~~~
</pre></code>

vs. Python-Markdown with CodeHilite (though you can enable the <code>fenced_code</code> extension to support all three syntaxes in Python-Markdown)

<code><pre>
    :::php
    code sample
</pre></code>
