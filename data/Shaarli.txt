<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>[http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli Shaarli]</dfn>''' is a simple web program you can install to store and share your bookmarks.</span> It has been designed to be lightweight and easy-to-use.

It is primarily a bookmarking application, but the feature list indicates you can also ". . . use it for micro-blogging (like Twitter), a pastebin, an online notepad, a snippet repository, etc."

IndieWeb community members who are using it on their own site:
* [[User:Upon2020.com|Johannes Ernst]] is using it since he moved from delicious.com, and he's not looking back!
* [[User:Exppad.com|Ã‰lie Michel]] uses it too.


== Webmentions ==
Adding a bookmark in Shaarli has it send a [[webmention]] to the target URL.

Actually, this function has not been merged to the master branch yet but is available in [https://github.com/eliemichel/Shaarli that fork].
