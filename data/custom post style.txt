'''<dfn>Custom post style</dfn>''' is the practice of styling individual [[posts]] differently from the rest of the site styles.

== Why ==
There are at least a few reasons why you may want to support custom post styles.
* special styling for a holiday
* testing / showing / teaching new styles
* post with a complicated table that needs custom styling
* ...

== How to ==
No general recommended technique yet. Check examples and brainstorming and try similar approaches.

== Indieweb Examples ==
=== Kartik Prabhu ===
{{kartik}} using [[Bundle]] has custom post styles for certain [[articles]] which are stored as CSS files with the same filename as the slug of the [[artilce]].
* Oldest example from (2006-08-23): [https://kartikprabhu.com/articles/nothing-left-dust] imported from original Blogger post [http://paralleltransport.blogspot.com/2006/10/nothing-left-but-dust.html]. 
* ... add more examples here ...

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} using [[p3k]] has posted custom styles for certain [[articles]], by adding an inline <style> tag to the contents of the article.
* Oldest example from 2013-03-11: http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2013/03/11/1/14-things-to-pack-for-a-week-at-a-tech-conference

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} using [[Falcon]] has custom post styles since 2015-07-04, e.g. added as an update to one recent post in particular:
* http://tantek.com/2015/178/t1/lovewins-css3-pride-rainbow-background
Method:
* use <code>&lt;style scoped="scoped" class="p-x-style"&gt; ... &lt;/style&gt;</code> directly inside an [[h-entry]] in storage
* retrieve that like any [[h-entry]] property and display as the last style element before the close <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> on the permalink for that post, again directly inside the h-entry, so it applies to it.
* use <code>[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-style-scoped style scoped]</code> to show custom post style on post in-stream (e.g. on [[homepage]])
** Note: As of 2015-07-03 only Firefox desktop/Android/OS  [http://caniuse.com/style-scoped supports style scoped] - but maybe that's ok and will provide a good real world use-case for other browsers to add support.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Blogger ===
[[Blogger]] allows inserting <code><style></code> elements directly into the HTML of a post, which can be used as a hack for custom post styles. E.g. [http://paralleltransport.blogspot.com/2006/10/nothing-left-but-dust.html]
=== Tumblr ===
[[Tumblr]] allows post styles in the same way as Blogger.

== Other Examples ==
=== Jason Santa Maria ===
[http://jasonsantamaria.com Jason Santa Maria] using [[ExpressionEngine]] had custom post styles for (almost) all posts made on [http://v4.jasonsantamaria.com version 4 of his site], between 2008-06-17 [http://v4.jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-new-day/] and 2011-06-16. Version 5 has rarely featured some custom post styles, recognisable by the screenshots on [http://v5.jasonsantamaria.com/articles/ the archive page].

Method:

* External CSS from <code>/css/entry/post_slug.css</code> included in the <code><head></code>.
* External JS from <code>/js/entry/post_slug.css</code> included in the <code><head></code>.

== Brainstorming ==
nothing here currently.
