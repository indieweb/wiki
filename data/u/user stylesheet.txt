{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>user stylesheet</dfn>''' is a customization of a third-party website within a browser to change the look and feel of that site using custom [[CSS]] or other code.


== Why ==
<blockquote>If I'm staring into something for over twenty hours a week, it better look and feel like beautiful home that fits my aesthetic tastes.<br/>&mdash;via [https://maggieappleton.com/paintingroam Maggie Appleton]</blockquote>


== Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} has created a [https://github.com/aaronpk/youtube-chat-overlay YouTube Chat Overlay] which is CSS and JS that turns the popout YouTube chat window into something that can be used to show chat comments greenscreened onto a video.
* Devon Zuegel has a repo called [https://github.com/devonzuegel/digital-nesting digital nesting] where she maintains customizations for [[Roam Research]], [[Google Docs]], [[Twitter]], and [[Zoom]]
* Maggie Appleton customizes [[Roam Research]] with some code she describes at [https://maggieappleton.com/paintingroam|Paint Your Roam with Custom CSS]


== Criticisms ==
* User customizations like this may only last for a little while until the silos change all their classes.
