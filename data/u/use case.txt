Because there is as broad an array of types of websites as there are [[people]], a motivating personal factor for joining the IndieWeb may entail a particular '''<dfn>use case</dfn>''' one has in mind for what they want to do online or how they'd like to interact with others.

Toward this end, this page can serve as a landing page for helping users who have particular use cases or specific functionalities in mind. Those individual pages will ideally provide links to examples and resources that these use cases may commonly utilize. These might help people define particular [[itch|itches]] they have for [[getting started]] or extending their online presences. They may also link to particular [[projects]] that are particularly strong or built to easily use with these specific use cases in mind.
