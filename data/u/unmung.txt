== Sample Instructions ==
To use unmung for feeds, enter the URL of an Atom or RSS feed as a parameter after <kbd>feed?feed=</kbd>, for example:
* <kbd><nowiki>https://unmung2.appspot.com/feed?feed=https://boingboing.net/feed</nowiki></kbd> 

You get an h-feed rendition of the feed.

This means you can subscribe to non-[[microformat]] feeds using a [[reader]] such as [[shrewdness]] or [[Woodwind]].

== Dead Domains ==
=== unmung.com ===
The domain <nowiki>unmung.com</nowiki> and subdomains (formerly linked from this page):
* <nowiki>www.unmung.com</nowiki>
* <nowiki>feed.unmung.com</nowiki>
are lost due to domain registrar problems ([[Google Domains]] originally using [[GoDaddy]] then somehow losing a way to sign-in and edit domains, then domains expiring and being squatted)
