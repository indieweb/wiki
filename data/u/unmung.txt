== Sample Instructions ==
To use unmung for feeds, go to [http://feed.unmung.com feed.unmung.com] and enter the URL of an Atom or RSS feed, for example [http://feed.unmung.com/feed?feed=http://daringfireball.net/feeds/main Daring Fireball].

You get an h-feed rendition of the feed.

This means you can subscribe to non-[[microformat]] feeds using a [[reader]] such as [[shrewdness]] or [[Woodwind]], eg [http://shrewdness.waterpigs.co.uk/test/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffeed.unmung.com%2Ffeed%3Ffeed%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fdaringfireball.net%2Ffeeds%2Fmain like this].
