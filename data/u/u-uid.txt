{{stub}}

'''<dfn>u-uid</dfn>''' is a [[microformats2]] property for representing a unique identifier for the item, e.g. an unchanging permalink, like a u-url but without any user-authored parts like a slug.

== Why ==
Publishing a stable u-uid for a post will help with implementing [[updated]] and especially [[deleted]] posts, where the u-url itself may (should in the delete case) change due to an altered (or removed) slug.

== Brainstorming ==
{{t}} I think a good way to implement u-uid on posts is to specify them as the post permalink but without anything user-authored, or user-alterable e.g. the slug should NOT be part of the u-uid. See [[URL design]] for more. I'm planning on implementing this soon. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 10:38, 27 May 2016 (PDT)

{{fluffy}} Note that if the UID is an opaque string (e.g. a uuid4) rather than a resolvable URI, it should be specified as <code>p-uid</code> instead. [[User:Beesbuzz.biz|Beesbuzz.biz]] ([[User talk:Beesbuzz.biz|talk]]) 20:05, 14 May 2021 (PDT)
