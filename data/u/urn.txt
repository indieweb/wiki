{{stub}}

'''<dfn>urn</dfn>''' is a Uniform Resource Name that comes from the original design of Internet resources but is often now a source of dead links.

It is part of the original three pieces to the naming structure that was supposed to form the base of the Internet's information architecture: URN, URC and URI - but current practice does not follow this pattern and should really be considered deprecated over a more IndieWeb friendly use of URLs
