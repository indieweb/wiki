{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>urn</dfn>''' is used to store the ashes of cremated people, however <dfn><abbr>URN</abbr></dfn> is an abbreviation for Uniform Resource Name, specified as a kind of URI, yet later abandoned by the [https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ URL Standard], and historically often a source of dead links, ironically aligned with the original common noun.

It is part of the original three pieces to the naming structure that was supposed to form the base of the Internet's information architecture: URN, URC and URI - but current practice does not follow this pattern and should really be considered deprecated over a more IndieWeb friendly use of URLs
