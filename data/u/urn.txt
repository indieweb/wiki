{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>urn</dfn>''' is used to store the ashes of cremated people, however <dfn><abbr>URN</abbr></dfn> is an abbreviation for Uniform Resource Name, specified as a kind of URI, yet later abandoned by the [https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ URL Standard] (which also deprecates URI & IRI), and historically often a source of dead links, ironically aligned with the original common noun.

== History ==
At some point (citation and date-range needed) URN was part of three pieces of naming / identifying / locating things on the internet:
* URI = URL + URN

Before that there was proposal to use the term <abbr>URC</abbr> (Uniform Resource Characteristics)
* See: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uri-urn2urc-00

Even older than that, Tim Berners-Lee had proposed the term <abbr>UDI</abbr> (Universal Document Identifier).
