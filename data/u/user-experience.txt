{{stub}}

'''<dfn>User experience</dfn>''', often abbreviated as <dfn>UX</dfn>, refers to the total experience a user has with a tool, or even an entire company, across all methods of communication and interaction with that tool, including both <em>direct</em> interactions using a tool [[UI]] and <em>indirect</em> interactions via other tools such as [[email]], [[SMS]], [[phone]] calls, in-person human representatives of the tool or company, etc.

== Why ==
Why UX? A good UX should/will make you more productive, more in control (user agency), while minimizing frustration.

== How ==
Iterating with your own use-cases (scratching your own itches, per [[principles]]) helps you at least build a good UX for yourself, as long as you do use it yourself ([[selfdogfood]]).

Then if/when you have a second user, watch *how* they use your software, and take notes. Watch where they get stuck, or frustrated. Listen to them verbalize *what* they want to get down, but be very ware of anything they say about *how* they want to do it, or any opinions about tools etc.

== Beware of ==
Beware of just "asking" users what they want. They're usually wrong (they don't have sufficient self-cognition plus design skills to do so, not their fault) and you'll usually get bad outcomes if you try to build accordingly.
