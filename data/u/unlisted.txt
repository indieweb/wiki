{{stub}}

'''<dfn>unlisted</dfn>''' are publicly visible posts that are not included in a homepage or feed(s), either some or all. They may also be excluded from site search.

== Similarity to private posts ==

Unlisted post can be a simple, easy to use approximation of [[private posts]], especially when they're:
* excluded from all feeds
* excluded from site search
* not linked from any public posts

The key differences are:
* Unlisted posts don't require login or other authentication. Anyone can open an unlisted post's permalink and see it, immediately. This is meaningful for accessibility, especially for wider [[generations]].
* Unlisted posts are a bit less secure, since they depend on their URLs staying secret. Anyone who has an unlisted post's URL can open and view it.

A few additional layers of security you can consider:
* Use [[Capability URLs]] for permalinks so that they're less guessable.
* Put all unlisted posts under a common URL path prefix that's blocked from search engines in [[robots_txt|robots.txt]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
none for sure, but anecdotally several community members report doing this with their some of their content, perhaps with entire post-types.

* {{aaronpk}} has some unlisted posts that do not appear in any normal feeds
** Unlisted posts do not appear on the home page or feeds, but do appear on the page for the date the post was created, and also appear when searching
** The URLs are still date-based and sequential, so are easily found by iterating, so this not considered a privacy measure
* {{martijnvdven}} has several unlisted posts that can only ever be accessed by people that received their URL
** All [[permalinks]] on his website are [[Capability URLs]] so no patterns can be exploited to gain access to unlisted posts
* {{eddiehinkle}} has some unlisted posts.
**Unlisted posts do not appear in the following areas:
*** homepage, feeds, local search, or archives.
**** They should logically not appear in search engines either, but he has not added any technical aspects to make that happen.
** Unlisted posts on his site are not linked to anywhere else and require the user to know the URL in order to access it.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] provides the ability to the user to "Hide post from feed" which can be used to make a post unlisted.
