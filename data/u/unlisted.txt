{{stub}}

'''<dfn>unlisted</dfn>''' are publicly visible posts that are not included in a homepage or main feed.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
none for sure, but anecdotally several community members report doing this with their some of their content, perhaps with entire post-types.

* {{aaronpk}} has some unlisted posts that do not appear in any normal feeds
** Unlisted posts do not appear on the home page or feeds, but do appear on the page for the date the post was created, and also appear when searching
** The URLs are still date-based and sequential, so are easily found by iterating, so this not considered a privacy measure
* {{martijnvdven}} has several unlisted posts that can only ever be accessed by people that received their URL
** All [[permalinks]] on his website are [[Capability URLs]] so no patterns can be exploited to gain access to unlisted posts

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] provides the ability to the user to "Hide post from feed" which can be used to make a post unlisted.
