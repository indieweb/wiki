{{stub}}

'''<dfn>unlisted</dfn>''' are publicly visible posts that are not included in a homepage or feed(s), either some or all. They may also be excluded from site search.

== Similarity to private posts ==

Unlisted post can be a simple, easy to use approximation of [[private posts]], especially when they're:
* excluded from all feeds
* excluded from site search
* not linked from any public posts

The key differences are:
* Unlisted posts don't require login or other authentication. Anyone can open an unlisted post's permalink and see it, immediately. This is meaningful for accessibility, especially for wider [[generations]].
* Unlisted posts are a bit less secure, since they depend on their URLs staying secret. Anyone who has an unlisted post's URL can open and view it.

As an extra layer of security, you can put all unlisted posts under a common URL path prefix that's blocked in [[robots.txt]]. This isn't strictly necessary if unlisted posts are never linked from public posts, but overlapping security layers are still a good idea.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
none for sure, but anecdotally several community members report doing this with their some of their content, perhaps with entire post-types.

* {{aaronpk}} has some unlisted posts that do not appear in any normal feeds
** Unlisted posts do not appear on the home page or feeds, but do appear on the page for the date the post was created, and also appear when searching
** The URLs are still date-based and sequential, so are easily found by iterating, so this not considered a privacy measure
* {{martijnvdven}} has several unlisted posts that can only ever be accessed by people that received their URL
** All [[permalinks]] on his website are [[Capability URLs]] so no patterns can be exploited to gain access to unlisted posts

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] provides the ability to the user to "Hide post from feed" which can be used to make a post unlisted.
