{{stub}}

'''<dfn>unlisted</dfn>''' are publicly visible posts that are not included in a homepage or feed(s), and are typically excluded from site search features and broader web search services.

== Similarity to private posts ==
Unlisted posts can be a simpler, easier to use approximation of [[private posts]], especially when they're:
* excluded from all feeds
* excluded from site search
* not linked from any public posts

The key differences are:
* Unlisted posts don't require login or other authentication. Anyone can open an unlisted post's permalink and see it, immediately. This is meaningful for accessibility, especially for wider [[generations]].
* Unlisted posts are a bit less secure, since they depend on their URLs staying secret. Anyone who has an unlisted post's URL can open and view it.

A few additional layers of security you can consider:
* Use [[Capability URLs]] for permalinks so that they're less guessable.
* Put all unlisted posts under a common URL path prefix that's blocked from search engines in [[robots_txt|robots.txt]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
none for sure, but anecdotally several community members report doing this with their some of their content, perhaps with entire post-types.

* {{t}}'s original blog was unlisted (no posts shown on home page, no feed) for a couple years (2002-2003) with explicit blocking of search engines in the site's robots.txt. This helped make it feel "easier" to write more quickly, and about more topics than if everything was being indexed for searching. His thinking was that you would read these posts only in the larger context of that month's stream and thus have better understanding than just finding them directly via a search engine.
** Subsequently (2004+), he occasionally wrote an unlisted post which had a public permalink summary in the archive of posts for that month, while still linking to the full post on a separate page.
** -- some of the below may be worth moving to [[homepage#Tantek]] and summarizing here --
** Mid 2006 he started showing his most recent post and other posts made in that same month on his home page tantek.com
** In March of 2009 he stopped showing posts on his home page and replaced it with a temporary splash screen with just the text "As simple as possible." which redirected after 4 seconds to a hexagon design site map.
** By July of 2009 he had incorporated the hexagon site map into his home page, no redirection, and soon after added a recommended events feed marked up in [[hCalendar]] with a button to subscribe to it.
** 2010 he relaunched his blog, in January without a stream, in February with a home page stream of posts, which has continued to the present day (2019) without any unlisted posts since
* {{aaronpk}} has some unlisted posts that do not appear in any normal feeds
** Unlisted posts do not appear on the home page or feeds, but do appear on the page for the date the post was created, and also appear when searching
** The URLs are still date-based and sequential, so are easily found by iterating, so this not considered a privacy measure
* {{martijnvdven}} has several unlisted posts that can only ever be accessed by people that received their URL
** All [[permalinks]] on his website are [[Capability URLs]] so no patterns can be exploited to gain access to unlisted posts
* {{eddiehinkle}} has some unlisted posts.
**Unlisted posts do not appear in the following areas:
*** homepage, feeds, local search, or archives.
**** They should logically not appear in search engines either, but he has not added any technical aspects to make that happen.
** Unlisted posts on his site are not linked to anywhere else and require the user to know the URL in order to access it.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] provides the ability to the user to "Hide post from feed" which can be used to make a post unlisted.
