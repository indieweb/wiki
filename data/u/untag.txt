'''<dfn>untag</dfn>''' is sending an [[edit]] request to delete one or more [[tag]]s (often [[person-tag]]s) on someones post, where those (person-)tags possibly originated from someone else's [[tag-of]] reply post.

== Use-cases ==
=== plain text untag ===
A [[GitHub]] issue has several labels (tags) on it.

Someone (with authority to alter labels on issues) chooses the label gear widget, and clicks the close box next to a label/tag, removing it.

=== untag persontag ===
Aaron posts a photo of Sebastiaan and Tantek sees that. 
* Tantek sends a [[tag-of]] reply to Aaron, notifying that it's Sebastiaan in the photo. 
* Aaron has Tantek whitelisted for tagging, and tags Sebastiaan on the photo. 
* Tantek and Aaron both send notifications to Sebastiaan, to notify him about the tag request and the update.

Sebastiaan then sees the photo, but doesn't want to be tagged.
* He creates an untag post, in reply to both the photo post and the tag-of post, and notifies both Aaron and Tantek. 
* Aaron sees Sebastiaan wants to be untagged, and prioritizes that wish above the tag-of from Tantek, thus deletes the tag. 
* Similarly, as a result of receiving the untag post, Tantek deletes the tag-of post.

== Silo Examples ==
=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] supports removing labels from issues which is a form of plain text untagging.

Just like their support for [[tag-reply#GitHub|tag replies]], removing labels also shows up explicitly among the comments on an issue and has its own fragment permalink.

E.g. https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/issues/763#event-1710566168

==== Github POSSE ====
Ideally you would post an untag response to a GitHub issue on your own site, and then automatically POSSE that untagging to GitHub.

Bridgy Publish feature request: 
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/811#issuecomment-382469530 There is also the counterpart: 'untag-of' postsâ€¦]

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to mark up? ===

Possible tags:
* <code>untag-of</code> - only delete the tag
* <code>delete-of</code> - can also be used for the whole photo (?)

=== hide the untag request ===
Since the untag request also links the identity and the photo, it should not be easily discovered and thus be a [[private post]] of some kind, e.g. not listed in feeds and at a non-guessable URL. If the other parties abide the request, it can be deleted - once the original tag-post is gone, the tag won't be accidentially recreated.
