'''<dfn>untag</dfn>''' is sending a request to delete a [[tag-of]] reply post on someones post.

== Use case ==

Aaron posts a photo of Sebastiaan and Tantek sees that. Tantek sends a [[tag-of]] reply to Aaron, notifying that it's Sebastiaan on the photo. Aaron has Tantek whitelisted for tagging, and tags Sebastiaan on the photo. (Tantek and Aaron both send notifications to Sebastiaan, to notify him about the tag request and the update.)

Sebastiaan then sees the photo, but doesn't like to be tagged. He creates an untag post, in reply to both the photo post and the tag-of post, and notifies both Aaron and Tantek. Aaron sees Sebastiaan wants to be untagged, and prioritizes that wish above the tag of Tantek, thus deletes the tag. Tantek deletes the tag-of post.

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to mark up? ===

Possible tags:
* <code>untag-of</code> - only delete the tag
* <code>delete-of</code> - can also be used for the whole photo (?)
