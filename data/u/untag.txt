{{stub}}

'''<dfn>untag</dfn>''' is sending an [[edit]] request to delete one or more [[tag]]s (often [[person-tag]]s) on someones post, where those (person-)tags possibly originated from someone else's [[tag-of]] reply post.

== Use case ==
Aaron posts a photo of Sebastiaan and Tantek sees that. 
* Tantek sends a [[tag-of]] reply to Aaron, notifying that it's Sebastiaan in the photo. 
* Aaron has Tantek whitelisted for tagging, and tags Sebastiaan on the photo. 
* Tantek and Aaron both send notifications to Sebastiaan, to notify him about the tag request and the update.

Sebastiaan then sees the photo, but doesn't like to be tagged.
* He creates an untag post, in reply to both the photo post and the tag-of post, and notifies both Aaron and Tantek. 
* Aaron sees Sebastiaan wants to be untagged, and prioritizes that wish above the tag-of from Tantek, thus deletes the tag. 
* Similarly, as a result of receiving the untag post, Tantek deletes the tag-of post.

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to mark up? ===

Possible tags:
* <code>untag-of</code> - only delete the tag
* <code>delete-of</code> - can also be used for the whole photo (?)

* [[edit]]
