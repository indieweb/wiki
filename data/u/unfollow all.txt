'''<dfn>unfollow all</dfn>''' is the practice of [[unfollow]]ing everyone on a [[social media]] site as a form of soft [[silo-quit]]ting and an antidote to [[doomscrolling]].

{{gRegor}}: In October 2019 I started to wean myself from using [[Facebook]] by unfollowing posts from all my friends and groups. The goal was to make the default news feed empty so I wouldn't get pulled back into it. It was a manual process of clicking the three dots on posts and selecting "Unfollow [name]" or visiting their profile, clicking the "Friends" button, then selecting "Unfollow." See the Facebook help page below.

<blockquote>
"When you unfollow someone, you won't see their posts in Feed, but you'll still be friends with them."

This [https://gregorlove.com/2019/10/the-facebook-news-feed/ resulted] in an empty news feed and a somewhat misleading message, "Get started by adding friends," even though I was still Facebook friends with all the same people.
