{{stub}}

'''<dfn>using</dfn>''' is the name of an authoring and/or publishing application, or can also be a page of tools and services that someone uses or likes to use. IndieWeb Example: https://aaronparecki.com/life-stack/ (see inside for links to more examples near the bottom), site dedicated to interviews of individuals and what they are using: https://usesthis.com/.

=== started using ===
{{t}}; If you posted about when you started using something (put it into regular use), and also when you stopped using something (perhaps related, was replaced by something you started using?) then you could automate building a "currently using" page like aaronpk's https://aaronparecki.com/life-stack/. Such "started using" posts are essentially a form of strongly positive [[review]]. Perhaps a review with hashtag #using to start.
