'''<dfn>u-syndication</dfn>''' is a way to discoverably link from your original posts to syndicated copies on other sites like social media [[silos]].

== Why ==
<div id="Use_cases">{{main|syndication-link-use-cases}}</div>

Why should an original post visibly hyperlink to syndicated copies? 

=== POSSE threading ===
It enables those that that reply to your posts and [[POSSE]] similarly, to thread their POSSE replies to your POSSE copies.

If an Indieweb site supports POSSEing to one or more [[silo]] destinations, it should:
* do u-syndication discovery on the original [[in-reply-to]] URL
* for each such POSSE destination:
** choose the first u-syndication link that goes to that destination and save it
* when POSSEing the [[reply]] post to each POSSE destination:
** if a u-syndication link was found for it
*** be sure to thread the POSSE copy of the reply as a reply to the respective u-syndication link

=== More use cases ===
For more use-cases see: [[syndication-link-use-cases]]

== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
An original post <em>should</em> add a <span id="Publishing">hyperlink</span> to syndicated copies (e.g. per [[POSSE]]) with a class name of <code>u-syndication</code> inside their [[h-entry]] markup.

See the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-syndication rel-syndication specification] for more details.

=== How to link to Twitter ===
When <span id="Linking_to_Twitter.com">linking to</span> [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSEd copies of posts on twitter.com]], make sure the link scheme is <code>https://</code> for [[original-post-discovery]] as Twitter.com redirects to https.

=== How to link from WordPress ===
The best option is {{GWG}}'s [[Syndication Links]] plugin. He took the functionality of the "WordPress Syndication" plugin below and merged it into this one so two things don't need to be maintained.

The following alternate plugins are unmaintained[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-15/line/1424035736201] and causes unknown error[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-15/line/1424035710146]:
* [[User:Jihais.se]]'s [https://wordpress.org/plugins/relsyndication/ rel-syndication] plugin. Integrates with other POSSE plugins; currently just [http://wordpress.org/plugins/social/ Mailchimp Social].
* [[User:Jihais.se]]'s [https://github.com/jihaisse/wordpress-syndication WordPress Syndication] plugin is the github for the same plugin[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-15/line/1424035956122].

=== How to use ===
An Indie Web site that supports the ability to [[reply]] to [[posts]] should allow you to reply to any URL. As part of that reply UI, it should do <span id="Discovery">u-syndication discovery</span> for the [[POSSE]] threading use case described above by following this algorithm:

u-syndication discovery algorithm:
# load the [[in-reply-to]] URL as a document
## parse the document for [[microformats2]]
## if there's a top level [[h-entry]]
## then collect all of its <code>syndication</code> property values 
# end if
# return whatever was collected

== Examples in the wild ==
* Hidden in the metadata for [https://www.nbc.com/meet-the-press/video/meet-the-press-113/3862006 an episode of Meet the Press] is a snippet of code: <code>"sameAs":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103396/"</code> indicating that data for the episode has ostensibly sent to imdb.com. Unfortunately in this example the link both isn't marked up properly nor does it point to the correct page. While not technically an example with proper mark up, it is a good example from a major corporation attempting to internally keep track of their syndication links and data.

== History ==
Previously, this page recommended using the <code>rel="syndication"</code> attribute on the syndication URLs. However, since rel attributes are page-scoped, this limits the usage to only on page permalinks. Using u-syndication allows syndication URLs to be included on [[h-entry]] posts within an [[h-feed]].
