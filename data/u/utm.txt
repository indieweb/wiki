{{stub}}

'''<dfn>utm_</dfn>''' is a commonly used prefix for URL query parameters used for tracking (like <dfn>utm_medium</dfn> <dfn>utm_source</dfn> <dfn>utm_campaign</dfn>) by various media and content publishing sites; it is considered good [[URL design]] to automatically drop them when publishing, sharing, or just linking to a URL that has them.
