'''<dfn>URI</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Uniform Resource Identifier which was a late 1990s to early 2000s term intended as broader in meaning than [[URL]].

Subsequently the modern [https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ URL standard] has officially standardized on the term URL, rejecting both "URI" and "IRI" as "just confusing", per [https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#goals URL Standard: Goals].
