{{stub}}

'''<dfn>undo</dfn>''' is a common action you can take (often a button or menu item) to reverse the effects of the previous action, as if the action had never occurred; on the indieweb, you may want to undo a [[post]], a [[delete|deletion]], or an [[update]].

== No side-effects ==
A key aspect of "undo" from a user perspective is that there are no side-effects of what they did and undid, it is literally as if the thing they had "done" had never been done in the first place.

The indieweb implication of this is that anything that your posts (or other actions) cause on ''other sites'' must not have occurred if you want to actually undo what you did (posted or other actions).

Examples (of side-effects that cannot be undone)
* Your [[feed file]] (RSS/Atom) being polled and cached by a [[feed reader]] (which won't update)
* [[POSSE]], e.g. to [[Twitter]], because it has been pushed to your followers clients, and they may have [[response|responded]] to it, copy/pasted it, etc.

== What is not undo ==
* Delete is not undo
* ...

== Service Examples ==
=== Gmail ===
[[Gmail]] has an option to turn on "Undo", which is most often useful for "Undo Send".

After you send / file etc. an email, Gmail shows an "Undo" link/button/notification (depends on UI version you're using / app / platform), which disappears for some time later (typically 30s, configurable)

Gmail implements undo send by introducing a delay (that same confirable 30s) before actually sending the email to the destination server.

=== Feed readers ===
If you publish a [[feed file]], at any time (likely within minutes if not seconds), it may be retrieved by a [[feed reader]], which, commonly will cache that version, and may not actually update it.

Thus if you publish a feed file with a new post, perhaps as soon as you update it on your server, it is not possible to undo that action, because that new post may have been retrieved and cached by feed readers.

Work-around:
* Only publish items which are 30 minutes or more older in your feed files (RSS/Atom). This way any edits / or undo publishing that you do within 30 minutes of publishing a post will not be seen by [[feed readers]], and thus give you plenty of time to "Undo" such actions without any side-effects in feed readers.
