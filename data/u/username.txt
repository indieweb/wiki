{{stub}}
A '''<dfn>username</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb typically refers to a unique series of letters (sometimes also numbers and underscores), without spaces or other punctuation, used to access and often identify an account on someone else’s internet service (like a [[silo]]) or your infrastructure (like a [[domain registrar]] or a [[webhost]]); on the IndieWeb wiki, and across the IndieWeb, your domain is your username.

Other terms sometimes used to mean '''username''':
* <dfn>handle</dfn>
* <dfn>alias</dfn>
* '''[[nick]]''' in the context of [[IRC]]
* <dfn>[[Wikipedia:Xbox_network#Gamertag|Gamertag]]</dfn> in the context of the [[Microsoft]] XBox network

== IndieWeb wiki username ==
Your IndieWeb wiki username is the [[web address]] you used to sign-into the wiki using [[IndieLogin]].

How do you change your IndieWeb wiki username? 

You don't because it is directly tied to the web address ([[domain name]]) you used to login.

== IndieWeb chat username ==
On various IndieWeb [[discuss]]ion services, you might be using a short name other than your web address / domain name.

You should add this short chat name to:
* '''[[chat-names]]'''
and link an icon so your chats show up with your icon in the chat archives.

== See Also ==
* [[identity]]
* [[domain name]]
* [[web address]]
