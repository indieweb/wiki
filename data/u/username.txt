{{stub}}
A '''<dfn>username</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb typically refers to a unique series of letters (sometimes also numbers and underscores), without spaces or other punctuation, used to access and often identify an account on someone else’s internet service (like a [[silo]]) or your infrastructure (like a [[domain registrar]] or a [[webhost]]); on the IndieWeb wiki, and across the IndieWeb, your domain is your username.
