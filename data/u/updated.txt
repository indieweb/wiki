An '''<dfn>updated</dfn>''' is a post that has been edited by the author. It should have <code>dt-updated</code> with the datetime of the update.

== Why ==
There are numerous reasons you may want to update a post, and indicate to others that you want any copies updated, hoping they will update any caches of it, from displays of your [[responses]] to [[reply-context]]s in reply to your original posts.

== Use Case ==
A user updates a post and wants any copies of that post (i.e. if it was a reply post) on other sites to also be updated.

__TOC__
== Handling ==
How to handle updated posts, i.e. implementation details:

* When a post is updated by the user, implementations should:
** send a webmention to all URLs that were either in the previous version of the post or the new version
** update any [[POSSE]] copies of that post. See [[POSSE#Update|POSSE Update]] for details.

* When the permalink of a post that has been updated is requested, implementations should return:
*# an HTML [[h-entry]] with a <code>dt-updated</code> with the date the post was updated.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Not sure who explicitly supports proper "updated" posts with dt-updated and automatic sending of webmentions to all URLs whether in the previous or new version of a post.

If you think you support updated posts properly, try http://webmention.rocks/ Update tests, if you pass them all, add yourself here with citations of your updated post(s).

=== bear ===
{{bear}} has implemented updated posts support on his site bear.im since 2016-04-15.

Example URL of an updated post:
* https://bear.im/bearlog/2016/106/testing-webmention-rocks-updates.html

== Media Examples ==
Major media sites update their articles from time to time, e.g.
=== New York Times ===
The [[New York Times]] updated 
[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/us/politics/health-care-affordable-care-act.html this article published 2017-03-24] within minutes of publication, with a revised article name and content edits:

[[File:2017-03-24-nyt-article-update.png]]

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] supports editing posts and shows that a post has been "edited". (See [[versioning#Facebook]] for details).

=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] supports replacing the photo of a photo post, without changing its permalink, comments etc.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Update POSSE copies ===
When you update a post, you should update its POSSE copies too if you can.

=== Notifying Responses ===
* send a webmention to all [[responses]] to the post (so the responses can update their [[reply-context]], per [[reply-context#CRUD|reply-context CRUD]], possibly [[notify]] the responder so they can update or delete their response).
** Note: this is subject to the [[reply-context#CRUD_Issues|issues documented re: reply-context CRUD]]

== Issues ==
=== Threaded Comments Problems ===
Similar to [[deleted]] posts, but perhaps less disruptive, and updated post or comment may impact the relevance / meaning of subsequent replies.
