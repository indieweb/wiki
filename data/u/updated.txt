An '''<dfn>updated</dfn>''' is a post that has been edited by the author. It should have <code>dt-updated</code> with the datetime of the update for machines. For people it may have either text and optionally some other visual indicator to show which parts of the post were changed.

[[HTML]] has tags including [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins <code><nowiki><ins></nowiki></code>] and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del <code><nowiki><del></nowiki></code>] for <del>assisting in</del> <ins>helping to</ins> mark up changes. Many CMS platforms include some basic CSS mark up for making these changes visually obvious. This paragraph is an example of how they display in MediaWiki with a strikethrough for <code><nowiki><del></nowiki></code> and an underline for <code><nowiki><ins></nowiki></code>.

== Why ==
There are numerous reasons you may want to update a post, and indicate to others that you want any copies updated, hoping they will update any caches of it, from displays of your [[responses]] to [[reply-context]]s in reply to your original posts.

== Use Case ==
A user updates a post and wants any copies of that post (i.e. if it was a reply post) on other sites to also be updated.

__TOC__
== Handling ==
How to handle updated posts, i.e. implementation details:

* When a post is updated by the user, implementations should:
** send a webmention to all URLs that were either in the previous version of the post or the new version
** update any [[POSSE]] copies of that post. See [[POSSE#Update|POSSE Update]] for details.

* When the permalink of a post that has been updated is requested, implementations should return:
*# an HTML [[h-entry]] with a <code>dt-updated</code> with the date the post was updated.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Not sure who explicitly supports proper "updated" posts with dt-updated and automatic sending of webmentions to all URLs whether in the previous or new version of a post.

If you think you support updated posts properly, try http://webmention.rocks/ Update tests, if you pass them all, add yourself here with citations of your updated post(s).

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has used the <code>dt-updated</code> microformat on his updated posts since around 2015. Except for small spelling or grammar errors, he marks up larger changes in HTML with the <code><nowiki><ins></nowiki></code> tag which includes some [[CSS]] to highlight all or portions of the changed text as necessary for readers.
* Code example: <code><nowiki><ins class="customstyleclass dt-updated" datetime="2018-07-10T11:47:12-07:00">This could be the updated content</ins></nowiki></code>
* Note: The [[WordPress]] Classic editor has an interface button that will automatically add something like <code><nowiki><ins datetime="2018-07-10T11:47:12-07:00"></nowiki></code>, but with the appropriate date and time the button was pressed, and then the closing tag to make this process easier.
* Example: https://boffosocko.com/2012/06/17/big-history/#Added%20material has two insertion tags to indicate that the material below them was added on subsequent updates.
* [[WordPress]] provides a custom query string (<code>/?orderby=modified</code>) that can be added onto URLs to provide a view of recent updates
** Example: https://boffosocko.com/?orderby=modified
** Example of a feed for updates https://boffosocko.com/feed/?orderby=modified


== Media Examples ==
Major media sites update their articles from time to time, e.g.
=== New York Times ===
The [[New York Times]] updated 
[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/us/politics/health-care-affordable-care-act.html this article published 2017-03-24] within minutes of publication, with a revised article name and content edits:

[[File:2017-03-24-nyt-article-update.png]]

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] supports editing posts and shows that a post has been "edited". (See [[versioning#Facebook]] for details).

=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] supports replacing the photo of a photo post, without changing its permalink, comments etc.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Update POSSE copies ===
When you update a post, you should update its POSSE copies too if you can.

=== Notifying Responses ===
* send a webmention to all [[responses]] to the post (so the responses can update their [[reply-context]], per [[reply-context#CRUD|reply-context CRUD]], possibly [[notify]] the responder so they can update or delete their response).
** Note: this is subject to the [[reply-context#CRUD_Issues|issues documented re: reply-context CRUD]]

== Issues ==
=== Threaded Comments Problems ===
Similar to [[deleted]] posts, but perhaps less disruptive, and updated post or comment may impact the relevance / meaning of subsequent replies.
