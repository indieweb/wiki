{{stub}}

'''<dfn>unpublished</dfn>''' is a status that indicates a post that is either not yet published (and will be in the future) or has been made private after having been published in the past.

== Brainstorming ==

=== Why ===

* You may unpublish a post if it was accidentally published (for example, if you pressed publish before you were ready).
* You may have another post that you want to replace the existing one while keeping the old draft for private reference.
