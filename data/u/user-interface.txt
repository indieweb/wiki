'''<dfn>User interface</dfn>''', often abbreviated as <dfn>UI</dfn>, formerly called <dfn>human interface</dfn> (<dfn>HI</dfn>), refers to presentational and interactive [[design]] elements of potentially any tool, but usually electronic tools, specifically their hardware and/or software.

A user interface is also often referred to in context simply as an <dfn>interface</dfn>, or implied when used as a compound noun with some user-level concept or object, e.g.:
* [[post]] and [[posting interface]]
* [[edit]] and [[editing interface]]
* [[comment]] and [[commenting interface]]
* [[admin]] and [[admin interface]]
