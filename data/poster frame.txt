{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>poster frame</dfn>''' is a static image taken from one frame of video to represent a video (like a [[video]] post) visually in various contexts such as a thumbnail or before the video is played.

== Why ==
You should include an explicit poster frame on your video posts to provide an image that is representative of what the video is about, since the first frame might not show much, or is blank.

== How ==
Use the HTML5 <code>poster</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag with a URL to the poster frame image like a JPEG.

{{veganstraightedge}} supports explicit poster frames in his video posts [https://github.com/veganstraightedge/sbbme/commit/0136c8106ad46a0769624ffa792b421668478151 since 2013-07-07](private GitHub repo commit). Example:
* http://veganstraightedge.com/videos/2013/5/31/1/backyard-squirrel-buddy (updated 2015-12-13 with fallback <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag)
** markup:
*** <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag with <code>u-featured</code> intending to communicate the <code>poster</code> attribute
*** <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> tag for <code>.MP4</code> video file and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with <code>u-photo</code> as a fallback for cases when native video isn't supported.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} supports explicit poster frames in his video posts [http://tantek.com/2015/360/t2/best-starwars-speak-droid since 2015-360] using an upgrade to the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function that implements: [http://tantek.com/w/Markdown#Videowithposter Video with poster] and Video with poster and hyperlink [[auto-link]]ing syntaxes. Example:
* 2015-360: http://tantek.com/2015/360/t2/best-starwars-speak-droid
