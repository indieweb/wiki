You must be ''this'' independent in order to contribute:
# you must have your own domain, and 
# have figured out how to set-up OpenID on it.

Here are a couple of options for #2.
* Easy: delegate your domain to another OpenID provider like myOpenID
* Harder: setup your server to be an OpenID provider

__TOC__

== Delegating your domain to myOpenID ==

''from https://www.myopenid.com/help#own_domain''

You can use your own URL as your OpenID, and still use myOpenID as your OpenID server. To set this up, [https://www.myopenid.com/signup create an account], and add the following markup into your page's head section:

<pre>
  <link rel="openid.server"
        href="http://www.myopenid.com/server" />
  <link rel="openid.delegate"
        href="http://youraccount.myopenid.com/" />
  <link rel="openid2.local_id"
        href="http://youraccount.myopenid.com" />
  <link rel="openid2.provider"
        href="http://www.myopenid.com/server" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-XRDS-Location"
        content="http://www.myopenid.com/xrds?username=youraccount.myopenid.com" />
</pre>
(If you have a .name account through FreeYourID.com, substitute first.last.name for youraccount.myopenid.com above)

That's it. You can now use your own URL to log into OpenID enabled sites with myOpenID as your OpenID server.

Please note that you will not be able to log into myopenid.com with your own URL; you must use your myOpenID identifier.

=== myOpenID Issues ===
==== X-XRDS-Location not valid HTML5 ====
* The following line no longer validates as valid html5.  A number of openID supported sites seem to work without the line.  Is it safe to remove it at this point? --[[User:Bret.io|Bret.io]] 23:51, 30 June 2013 (PDT)
<pre><meta http-equiv="X-XRDS-Location" content="http://www.myopenid.com/xrds?username=youraccount.myopenid.com" /> </pre>
** I'm pretty sure XRDS is optional and only used for fallback. So you can leave it out. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 09:37, 1 July 2013 (PDT)

== Delegating your domain to Vidoop ==
'''WARNING: Vidoop is no longer around, and their servers are running due to the grace of the new owners. They could be shut off at any point.[http://www.anotherblogger.com/2009/05/30/openid-delegation-makes-vidoops-failure-painless/] Consider switching OpenID providers ASAP.'''

If you're using Vidoop as your OpenID provider, you can instead delegate from your own domain to Vidoop by placing these into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your [[home page]]:

From: https://myvidoop.com/help/what-is-delegation

<pre><nowiki>
<link rel="openid2.provider" href="https://myvidoop.com/openid" />
<link rel="openid.server"    href="https://myvidoop.com/openid" />

<link rel="openid2.local_id" href="http://username.myvidoop.com" />
<link rel="openid.delegate"  href="http://username.myvidoop.com" />

<meta http-equiv="X-XRDS-Location" content="http://username.myvidoop.com/xrds" />
</nowiki></pre>

Where "'''username'''" (in the latter 2 link elements and the meta element) should be replaced with your personal username on Vidoop.

== Installing on your own server ==
One option is to install [http://siege.org/phpmyid.php phpMyID] on your server. It is a single file that you can drop on to your server to create an OpenID provider.

You can read about some other options here:

openid.net has further information for developers: http://openid.net/developers/

== Troubleshooting ==
If even after setting up OpenID or delegation, signing-in doesn't appear to work:

* If you're running WordPress - see if you have the WP-SuperCache plugin and delete the cache or turn off caching. 
* Verify that when you load your site in your browser, you can view source and see the OpenID delegation <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> (and <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>) tags.
* Be sure that you've changed "username" in those tags to your own specific username on the OpenID service.
