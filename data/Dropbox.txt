== Criticism ==
* I would not recommend hosting a static site on Dropbox. It's possible but it's not the intention and is not well-supported. [[GitHub Pages]] is a better free option [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 12:57, 18 September 2014 (PDT)
* In 2015-12, Dropbox [http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/07/dropbox-is-shutting-down-mailbox-in-february-2016-and-carousel-in-march-2016/ announced] they were shutting down two apps they maintainâ€”email app Mailbox (in 2016-02) and photo app Carousel (2016-03). This raises questions about the longevity of other Dropbox-provided services.
