'''<dfn>protocols</dfn>''' are defined ways for programs to interact with each other, and key [[building blocks]] of the IndieWeb.

On the IndieWeb the following protocols are in wide use:
* HTTP(S)
* [[Webmention]]
* [[Micropub]]

Not as widely used, but slowly growing:
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[PuSH]] (especially among indie [[readers]])
