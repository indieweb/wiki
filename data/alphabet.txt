An '''<dfn>alphabet</dfn>''' refers to the set of symbols used by a particular writing system, typically as building blocks, like A-Z for English, and in the context of IndieWeb, we can use them to refer to key IndieWeb building blocks.

Please update this alphabet with additional terms for each letter as new building blocks appear and gain prominence in the IndieWeb. Please only change the first term for a letter if it really is the most prominent building block for that letter for the IndieWeb.

== IndieWeb Alphabet ==
Here's an A-Z alphabet of IndieWeb building blocks, choosing a primary one for each (with perhaps a few secondary / also rans)

* A is for '''[[article]]''' and less often [[audio]] posts such as [[podcasts]], as well as having an [[archive]] UI, and the [[authorship]] algorithm.
* B is for '''[[backfeed]]''' as well [[Bridgy]], the awesome backfeed as a service proxy, and [[bookmark]] posts
* C is for '''[[checkin]]''', [[collection]], & [[comics]] posts, and [[communication]], in particular having a [[contact]] page, as well as the [[create]] UI pattern. Culturally, we have [[commons]] and our [[code-of-conduct]].
* D is for '''[[design]]''', as well as the [[delete]] protocol in which the IndieWeb uses HTTP 410 Gone for decentralized deletions, and the [[disclosure]] UI pattern.
* E is for '''[[event]]''', [[edit]], and [[exercise]] posts
* F is for '''[[food]]''' posts, [[follow]] posts which are how you express in a decentralized way that you're following someone's posts, [[fragmentions]] - how you mention part of the text in a post or on a page, the [[facepile]] UI pattern, and [[file-storage]], a common alternative to databases used by many in the IndieWeb.
* G is for '''[[generations]]''' - a key building block for IndieWeb adoption, activism, and advocacy.
* H is for '''[[homepage]]''' - everyone should have one and own their own, [[HTML]] & [[HTTPS]] of course, and for community the [[Homebrew Website Club]].
* I is for '''[[IndieAuth]]''' and [[IndieMark]], less frequently [[invitation]] posts, [[indie-config]], and for community [[IndieWeb]] and [[IndieWebCamp]] of course.
* J is for '''[[jam]]''' posts, where you post what music you're currently jamming to.
* K is for '''[[Known]]''', perhaps the most popular IndieWeb-supporting-by-default [[CMS]].
* L is for '''[[like]]''' posts, and our [[longevity]] principle
* M is for '''[[microformats]]''' and [[Micropub]], less frequently [[marginalia]], and a reminder to make sure your site works well on [[mobile]]
* N is for '''[[note]]''', perhaps the simplest and most fundamental [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|IndieWeb post type]], and [[notifications]]
* O is for '''[[ownyourdata]]''', a key indieweb incentive, motivation, rallying cry, and hashtag, as well as the excellent [[OwnYourGram]] service for automatically PESOSing your Instagram photos to your own site via micropub.
* P is for '''[[posts]]''' with [[permalinks]], also [[photo]] posts, [[POSSE]] as key distinguishing feature of the IndieWeb, or [[PESOS]] if you have to, and [[person-tag]]s. See also [[PubSubHubbub]] and of course our cultural [[principles]] including encouraging a plurality of [[projects]]
* Q is for '''[[quotation]]''' posts, as well as the open source [[Quill]] micropub client.
* R is for '''[[reply]]''', perhaps the second most common type of indieweb post, and its related [[reply-context]] UI pattern, but also [[repost]] posts, and having an integrated [[reader]] as a building block of your site rather than a separate thing.
* S is for a '''[[stream]]''' of posts, at least one or more on your homepage or other pages, as well as [[scrobble]] & [[sleep]] posts, and our [[selfdogfood]] principle
* T is for '''[[text-first design]]''', and [[travel]] posts, [[tags]], as well as the community [[timeline]] of key IndieWeb terms/ideas/concepts
* U is for '''[[UX]]''' - short for user experience, one of our primary focuses and principles, inclusive of [[UI]] short for user interface, as well as [[URL design]].
* V is for '''[[video]]''' posts, as well as [[Vouch]] - a Webmention extension for reducing or preventing spam.
* W is for '''[[Webmention]]''', less frequently [[webactions]], for community [[wikifying]], and the popular IndieWeb-capable-with-plugins [[WordPress]] project, as well as the [[Woodwind]] indieweb reader.
* X is for '''[[XFN]]''' - the increasingly ironically named XHTML Friends Network, a spec in wide use for identity and authentication with <code>rel=me</code>, and less frequently for other values like contact, acquaintance, friend, etc.
* Y is for '''[[YAGNI]]''' - short for "You Aren't Gonna Need It" and one of the best ways the IndieWeb community has found to both simplify, and/or debunk & fight off more complex proposals (often from academics or enterprise [[architects]]).
* Z is for '''[[Z]]''' time, AKA zero offset from UTC, a common technique used by indieweb servers and projects to avoid problems with [[timezones]].
