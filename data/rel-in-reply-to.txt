{{stub}}

'''<dfn>rel=in-reply-to</dfn>''' is a rel value for indicating the destination of a link is an original [[post]] that the current page is a [[reply]] to.

See the spec: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-in-reply-to

== Why ==
Currently there is no consuming code or application that depends exclusively on rel=in-reply-to, therefore there is no specific reason why you should need to add it.

== How to consume ==

See [[in-reply-to#How_to_consume_in-reply-to|in-reply-to algorithm]] for a detailed explanation of how to determine the URL(s) a post is in reply to.
