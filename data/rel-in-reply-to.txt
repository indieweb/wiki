{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-in-reply-to rel=in-reply-to]</dfn>''' is a [[rel-values|rel value]] for indicating the destination of a link is an original [[post]] that the current page is a [[reply]] to; because of its page-scoped rel-limitation, you should use [[u-in-reply-to]] in addition or instead.

== Why ==
Currently there is no consuming code or application that depends exclusively on rel=in-reply-to, therefore there is no specific reason why you should publish it.

== How to consume ==
See [[in-reply-to#How_to_consume_in-reply-to|in-reply-to algorithm]] for a detailed explanation of how to determine the URL(s) a post is in reply to.
