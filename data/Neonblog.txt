Neonblog is an indieweb microblog developed by
[[User:notenoughneon.com|Emma Kuo]] and running on

microformats as its native data store.

Neonblog isn't recommended for general use, but if you want to
try it, there are relatively few dependencies:

* PHP 5.4 (json, curl, openssl, imagick)
* Apache mod_rewrite
* write access to the filesystem (CGI/FCGI should work, mod_php may be problematic)

All configuration is in the file config.json.

== Architecture ==

Neonblog uses microformats as its native data store. Posts are
written to html files and served as static content by Apache. When
posts need to be updated, such as adding replies, the h-entries are
parsed to an intermediate representation before being transformed
back to html using a set of Mf2-aware templates.

The home page feed is generated with the help of an index that
stores url, local filename, date and post type. This is persisted in
a json file, with the intent to upgrade to SQLite if performance
becomes an issue. The index is used to quickly locate the relevant
posts to load, which are parsed for microformats and redisplayed in
a feed format.

Received webmentions are queued for either manual approval via UI or
a bulk auto-accept running on a cron job. The index is used to
determine if the target url is a valid post.

OAuth tokens and queued webmentions are also stored using json.
