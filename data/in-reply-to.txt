{{stub}}

'''<dfn>in-reply-to</dfn>''' is a [[rel]] value for use where a [[post]] [[permalink]] page is a [[reply]] to another post. The reply post should hyperlink to the other post with [[rel-in-reply-to]]. Often linked inside the [[reply-context]] of a reply post.

See the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-in-reply-to rel-in-reply-to] specification for details.

Additionally:
* The [[microformats2]] class name <code>u-in-reply-to</code> should also be placed on such hyperlinks from reply posts to the posts that they're a reply to.
* The microformats2 <code>u-in-reply-to h-cite</code> classnames can also be used to embed a [[reply-context]] with more detail than just a URL

== How to consume in-reply-to ==
Summary: collect an ordered list of unique in-reply-to URLs by checking and adding from:
# the first h-entry for "in-reply-to" URLs (including embedded)
# the rel collection for "in-reply-to" URLs

=== algorithm ===
Given a URL of a post, to determine the URL(s) itâ€™s in-reply-to:

* Let <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> be an empty list
* Parse the post's HTML for microformats2. If there are any h-entries, get the first one
** If the h-entry has an in-reply-to property, for each item in its array of values:
*** If the item is a string, append it to <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> if not already there
*** If the item is an embedded microformat, check if it has a ''url'' property. If it does, append the first url property value to <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> if not already there
*** Otherwise ignore the item
** If the post's rel collection has an "in-reply-to" entry, append each URL value in that entry to <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> if not already there
* <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> is now a list of all the URLs the parsed URL is in-reply-to

You may use a different algorithm if it produces exactly the same results. E.g. you could skip checking "if not already there" conditions, and instead at the end perform a step of "* Remove duplicate values from <var>in-reply-to-urls</var>" - as long as you removed latter duplicates, and kept first occurrences in the list.

==Usage Examples==

* [[tantek]] uses <code>u-in-reply-to</code> along with <code>h-cite</code> to mark-up reply notes. E.g. [http://tantek.com/2014/042/t3/learned-made-irc-wiki-works-hentry-hreview]

== FAQ ==
=== Must an in-reply-to link be inside an h-entry ===
''Q: Does an in-reply-to link have to be inside an h-entry?''

A: '''No.''' An in-reply-to link can be anywhere on the page using rel-in-reply-to, which then makes that page represent a reply to the destination of that link. The first h-entry, if any, then represents specifically the reply content and author, which may or may not actually contain the in-reply-to link. 

=== Why would an in-reply-to be outside an h-entry ===
''Q: Why would a page have a rel-in-reply-to outside an h-entry?''

A: A simple rel=in-reply-to hyperlink is '''easier for publishers''' to publish simple permalink reply pages and thus we want to allow that. They may later add h-entry markup for the contents of their comment and authorship, which may not actually contain the link at all. 

In the broader blogosphere, comments on posts rarely actually include the URL of the post they're commenting on, thus you can't depend on the in-reply-to being inside the h-entry (or certainly not inside the content) of such a reply post.
