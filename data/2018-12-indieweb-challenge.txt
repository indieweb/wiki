The '''<dfn>IndieWeb Challenge</dfn>''' is to collectively ship something IndieWeb-related every day of December! Anyone can participate, and if you're looking for something to do, there's always '''[[to-do]]'''. This can be anything from editing wiki pages to shipping updates on any of the [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries].

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below!

** Move [https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/ mf2 issues] forward in state per the mf2 parsing change process
*** Add labels to the mf2 issues repo similar to [https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels those on the CSSWG repo] (but based on our mf2 change control process) to capture and make explicit issue state
**** Implement space separated labels via _ in hashtags (per recent chat discussion (needs permalink)) after documenting them in [[hashtags#Brainstorming]]
