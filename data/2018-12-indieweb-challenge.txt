The '''<dfn>IndieWeb Challenge</dfn>''' is to collectively ship something IndieWeb-related (preferably benefiting the community, folks in addition to yourself) every day of December! Anyone can participate, and if you're looking for something to do, see the '''[[#Inspiration|Inspiration section below]]'''. This can be anything from major wiki contributions / improvements to shipping updates on any of the [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], see [[2017-12-indieweb-challenge|last year’s challenge]] for more examples.

You may want to first make a commitment (and follow through) to ship something you’ll use on your own site, as it will likely help reveal ways to improve things for the community as a whole:
* [[2019-01-01-commitments]]

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below! <!-- see https://indieweb.org/2017-12-indieweb-challenge for the syntax for doing so. -->

== Inspiration ==
Looking for something to do to benefit the community?

In general (feel free to add things here that you find inspiring in general, or hope someone else is inspired to do :)
* '''[[to-do]]''' and look for something you can do in a day!
* New release of [[microformats2]] parser(s)
** php-mf2
*** +1 {{GWG}} with "ID" parsing ([https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/44 mf2 #44], [https://github.com/microformats/php-mf2/issues/206 phpmf2 #206] and [https://github.com/microformats/php-mf2/pull/207 pull #207!]).
** ...
* Check out what {{jgmac1106}} is doing for his [[100DaysOfIndieWeb]] and do something similar! 
** https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/pages/100daysofindieweb
* ...

Specific inspirations:
* {{t}}: In addition to [[to-do]] items I've added (which anyone should feel free to snipe), I want to:
** Update [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing mf2 parsing spec] with resolved issues
** Move [https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/ mf2 issues] forward in state per the mf2 parsing spec change process
*** Determine set of GitHub Labels for mf2 issues based on [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing#change_control mf2 parsing spec change process] (similar to / re-use from [https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels those on the CSSWG repo]), consider also what labels would help [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#change_control h-entry change process].
*** Add minimum necessary Labels to the mf2 issues repo to capture and make explicit issue / change proposal stages / next action needed / waiting for.
*** Implement space separated labels via _ in hashtags
**** Document use-cases for space separated labels via _ in hashtags: [[POSSE]] a hashtag to [[GitHub]] as a Label (which may hae spaces), both on new issues, and tag-of replies.
**** Document how to create space separated labels via _ in hashtags per recent [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-16#t1542392876812700 2018-11-16 #dev chat discussion] in [[hashtags#Brainstorming]]. 

* {{eddiehinkle.com}}: My goal is to try to make some UI/UX improvements to some areas throughout the wiki
** Develop some html and css around the proposed homepage layout changes discussed at previous Organizers meet-ups and other layouts that could help move some of the intro pages of the wiki forward in UI/UX.
** Improve [[IndieWebCamp]] page by creating a section at the top that explains more in-depth what you can expect at an IndieWebCamp and what the experience is like with some photos from recent IWCs. Previous IWCs should be less emphasized and lower down near the bottom of the page.
** Release Swift library for IndieAuth/Micropub

* {{GWG}} improve and ship an update to [[Simple Location]]
** Fix a bunch of little bugs with my code that are affecting workflows
** The upgrade I demoed at IWC NYC caused an issue with posting my podcast I have to fix.
*** People are saying, I can intermittently reproduce it, that the private/public location setting is not behaving itself. And if I want to default to always storing location...
