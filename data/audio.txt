'''<dfn>audio</dfn>''' is a sound recording indieweb [[post]] that is spoken or otherwise created by the author of a site.

== Why ==
Audio posts, especially spoken word like [[podcasts]], can be very personal and emotionally compelling. In many ways a high quality audio post has a very different impact on the listener than the equivalent as a text note.

== How ==
Use an [[h-entry]] as always, and then an HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element with class name <code>u-audio</code> and <code>src</code> attribute of the URL of the audio file, e.g.

<pre><nowiki>
<audio class="u-audio" src="http://ben.example.com/talking.wav" controls="controls">
alternate text content - like a transcript
</audio>
</nowiki></pre>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} uses [[Known]] to post audio to his site [http://werd.io werd.io] since [http://werd.io/2014/a-little-indieweb-audio-while-i-wait-for-my-flight 2014-06-27]. Example:
* http://werd.io/2014/a-little-indieweb-audio-while-i-wait-for-my-flight
=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} posts audio to his site [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/ ben.thatmustbe.me] since [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/audio/2015/1/9/8/ 2015-01-09]. Example:
* https://ben.thatmustbe.me/audio/2015/1/9/8/

== Silo Examples ==
Soundcloud is a silo for audio  posts; as well as the audio file, it also expects a poster image to go with it, both for on-site presentation and for creating previews on other silos like facebook. 
For example [https://soundcloud.com/the-marksist/marks-mix-21-about-damn-time this mix] has an [http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000128719033-zpa2wf-t500x500.jpg image] that is exported in facebook, twitter, oembed and schema markup to cat as a preview.
