'''<dfn>recursive reply-contexts</dfn>''' (previously confusingly called as <dfn>reply-thread</dfn> and <dfn>history-thread</dfn>) are a list of [[reply-context]]s displayed above a reply post, where each reply-context is there to show context along an in-reply-to chain of links from a reply post all the way up to an original post (that itself is not a reply).

== Indieweb Examples ==
=== Ben Roberts ===
[[User:Ben.thatmustbe.me|Ben Roberts]] displays recursive reply-contexts on his site [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2014/9/12/1/_ since 2014-09-12]. Examples: 
* https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2014/9/12/1/_ 
* https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2014/9/12/2/_ 

== Why ==
Reader comprehension. You should show recursive reply-contexts above your reply posts to provide background and context to what your reply posts are about all the way up to what post started it.
