= Mixi =
<dfn>Mixi.jp</dfn> is a popular content hosting [[silo]] and activity [[aggregator]] which is the most popular social network in Japan.

== Criticisms ==
In order to prevent abuse, Mixi requires users to enter a Japanese phone company and number to register.  Registration completion links are then emailed to the phone.  This creates a requirement that a person have a contract cell phone in Japan (Google Voice or Skype numbers will not work).
