* <cite>[http://nymag.com/following/2016/03/julieanne-smolinski-quitting-twitter.html Twitter Has Become a Park Filled With Bats and Perverts]</cite> <blockquote>I’m quitting Twitter for a specific, practical reason: Because I keep getting bothered by assholes and perverts and Twitter doesn’t seem willing or able to do anything about it. I’m quitting Twitter the way you quit your favorite restaurant when it suffers an E. coli outbreak. I'm quitting Twitter for the simple fact that Twitter’s been bumming me out.</blockquote>

=== Tino Kremer ===
2016-02-20
I have removed / made my profiles private and removed all posts from:
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google+
* Flickr
* Medium

I have decided to post only to my site and direct people to there. My site is publicly accessible, it provides RSS feeds and people can use an indieweb reader like Woodwind. ... My stream is unfiltered, contains only content I explicitly posted (no ads or other stuff) and therefore it's easy for anyone to read and they can be sure they get everything, not a subset some algorithm decided upon.

2016-02-15 [[Twitter]]
* <cite>[http://www.stephenfry.com/2016/02/15/peedinthepool/ Too many people have peed in the pool]</cite> <blockquote>It’s no big deal – as it shouldn’t be. But yes, for anyone interested I have indeed deactivated my twitter account. I’ve ‘left’ twitter before, of course: many people have time off from it whether they are in the public eye or not. Think of it as not much more than leaving a room. I like to believe I haven’t slammed the door, much less stalked off in a huff throwing my toys out of the pram as I go or however one should phrase it. It’s quite simple really: the room had started to smell. Really quite bad.</blockquote>

* 2015-12-03 <cite>[http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/12/03/work-in-progress/ Work in Progress: The Future of (My) Web (Part 1, Leaving Facebook)]</cite> (and [https://twitter.com/mothersele/status/672427488056844288 tweet])<blockquote>I deleted my Facebook account on 10th November 2015. This time there's no going back.</blockquote>

Previous challenges:
* <blockquote><p>I have posted before about my decision to leave Facebook. In fact, that was almost exactly 2 years ago. I tried to leave. It didn't work. Six months later I returned.</p><p>The main reason for my return was that Facebook had become the '''single place where my friends organised social events'''. I was locked in. </p></blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.

[[Twitter]] <cite>[http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/joss-whedon-on-leaving-twitter Joss Whedon Calls “Horsesh*t” On Reports He Left Twitter Because Of Militant Feminists]</cite>
* 2015-05-04: <blockquote>Whedon said, is that he chose to embrace his longstanding desire post–Age of Ultron to reclaim his personal life and creative spark — and that meant saying goodbye to Twitter.</blockquote><blockquote>Whedon laid out a portrait of the constant noise of Twitter and his complicated relationship to it to explain what eventually led him to leave.</blockquote><blockquote>“Twitter is an addictive little thing, and if it’s there, I gotta check it. When you keep doing something after it stops giving you pleasure, that’s kind of rock bottom for an addict. … I just had a little moment of clarity where I’m like, You know what, if I want to get stuff done, I need to not constantly hit this thing for a news item or a joke or some praise, and then be suddenly sad when there’s hate and then hate and then hate.”</blockquote>

[[Facebook]] <cite>[https://the-pastry-box-project.net/antonio-savorelli/2015-march-31 The Friction of Quitting]</cite>
* 2015-03-31: <blockquote>A couple of months ago I decided to quit Facebook once and for all, and stop considering it an inevitability of my digital identity. Its business strategy had always creeped me out, even before the advent of frictionless sharing, which is something bad labeled as something good. Nothing I’ve done throughout the years has ever fully succeeded in toning down the sources of creepiness, from the so-called Facebook envy to the feeling I have that even the smartest of my friends become shallow, babbling dummies the moment they open Facebook—which makes me certain that I too, in their eyes, must appear the same way, even more than my offline self does.</blockquote>

=== Geoff Nicholson ===
[[Facebook]]
* 2014-12-12: <blockquote><p>A few people have recently asked me why I left facebook.  Mostly, it was because I was compulsively checking it for no real reason.  Yes, I miss out on the heartwarming stories that people post, and I miss out on hearing what my friends are doing in places far and near.  But I also miss out on tracking cookies, being an outlet for advertising, and siloing my data in Facebook's vaults.</p><p>Mostly, I've decided to implement the #indieweb.  This is a set [[Principles]] which I think the web is missing out on. [...]</p>[http://atomickiva.net/2014/exit]</blockquote>

[[Facebook]]
* 2014-06-29: Announced he is probably leaving Facebook in one week.
* <cite>[http://www.chuqui.com/2014/06/facebook-steps/ Facebook Steps In It]</cite> <blockquote>My bottom line is that I keep looking for ways to spend less time on Facebook because I get very little value for the time spent there — I’d rather put that time into more productive things. Facebook just isn’t that interesting or useful, and I’m not thrilled with their tendency to set policies that ignore the needs and interests of their users in favor of things that benefit Facebook.</blockquote>

=== Brennan Novak ===
[[Facebook]]
* 2014-06-06 <cite>[https://brennannovak.com/essays/dear-facebook-goodbye Dear Facebook, Goodbye]</cite> <blockquote>In honor of the one year anniversary of Edward Snowden's revelations and in effort to #ResetTheNet, I am leaving Facebook. I will first download all my pictures, updates, and private messages and then delete my account data.</blockquote>

* 2014-05-06 Tyler Finck: <cite>[http://www.tylerfinck.com/2014/05/antisocial-networking/ Antisocial Networking]</cite> <blockquote><p>Last weekend I deleted my Instagram account, my Facebook Page, and my Google+ profile. [...]</p><p>Over the past year I’ve tweaked my website almost every month, editing code and experimenting live. I’ve also started to create content two or three times a month. This site has become the place that I’m ready to host almost everything I make. The one stop Tyler Finck shop, which sounds horrible but is the best summary of the journey that I didn’t even know I was on until very recently. [...]</p><p>Note: I plan on keeping my [[Twitter]] account active because after six years of use I still love it. My [[Flickr]] stream will soon become private as a means of backup and my [[Tumblr]] panoramas will be rolled into tylerfinck.com. [[Vimeo]]/[[YouTube]]? I’m not entirely sure what to do with them (since I utilize those sites only to serve up content). My love/hate relationship with [[Dribbble]] continues, and I’m still experimenting with [[Soundcloud]].</p></blockquote>

* 2014-03-21 Dadepo Aderemi: <cite>[http://geekabyte.blogspot.nl/2014/03/getting-personal.html Getting Personal]</cite>: <blockquote>I am avoiding Facebook by all means now. I still keep using twitter though, but majorly as a source of discovery for things around my area of professional interests, and once in a while, a place to engage in ephemerial and disjointed rants. If I have something on my mind I really feel the need to share or capture, I write a coherent post instead. No, sorry: fusilade of tweets is no longer for me. </blockquote>

The things github provides (that are also the data you do not control) are things like issues. Things that are the real ‘community’ part of your project. As my friend @baldwin said to me earlier today, “It’s interesting that github seems to have re-centralized git.”</blockquote>
