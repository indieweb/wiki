{{stub}}

<dfn>SQLite</dfn> is a relational database that stores an entire database in a single file. Unlike most databases, it is accessed as a library rather than a separate process.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{kylewm}} is experimenting with SQLite as the primary datastore for [[Red Wind]].
* [[Sandstorm]] recommends that apps use SQLite if possible because each application runs in its own container, and therefore cannot share a single e.g., MySQL instance.
