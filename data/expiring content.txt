'''<dfn>Expiring content</dfn>''' is content that is only temporarily (ephemerally) relevant, and also part of a larger post, that can and should be (preferably automatically) removed once a particular datetime has passed (the expiration date).

== To Do ==
Some URLs to read, extract info from, and expand this article with:
* 2009-05-08 http://moz.com/blog/whiteboard-friday-expired-content
* http://moz.com/blog/how-should-you-handle-expired-content
Others:

== Real World Needs Examples ==
Examples of IndieWeb sites/posts with content that would benefit from automatic expiry.

=== Tantek ===
This post: http://tantek.com/2014/308/b2/my-first-year-november-project#half-marathon-hills-track has a couple of pieces of temporal content I would have liked to have expire automatically:
* " (Reminder: NovemberProject 2014 Yearbook Photos Are Tomorrow!) " - an entire paragraph I'd have liked to have disappear automatically once the referenced event had passed.
* "hopefully this Sunday at the Berkeley Half. " - have it expire and be replaced by a placeholder of some sort until I update it with my finishing time and other info.

== WordPress Plugins ==
* https://wordpress.org/plugins/expiring-content-shortcode/
* http://alexking.org/blog/2010/11/02/expiring-content-shortcode

== Brainstorming ==
=== Creating ===
What would be a good way (UX) for the user to select and indicate that some content should be expired when?
=== Storage ===
What would be a good way to store that certain sections of content should be expired?
=== Updating ===
What would be a good way(UX) for the user to select and indicate that some content should be replaced by some other content automatically when?
