{{stub}}

'''<dfn>pay for reach</dfn>''' is a business practice by [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and other social media [[silos]], whereby they charge publishers (ask them to pay) to have their posts be shown to users on their site, even if the users have already opted-in ([[followed]], subscribed) to posts from those publishers.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has been well documented to show posts from people (or publishers) to only a fraction of their friends or followers based on the [[Facebook Master Algorithm]].

They then prompt publishers to pay to reach a larger subset.
