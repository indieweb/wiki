<span class="p-summary">The HTML '''<dfn>dfn</dfn>''' tag is a way to denote the first time a term is defined.</span>

This wiki uses the &lt;dfn&gt; tag to mark up the sentence containing the tag with <code>p-summary</code> so that parsers can easily find a one-sentence summary of wiki pages which themselves all use the [[h-entry]] microformat.
