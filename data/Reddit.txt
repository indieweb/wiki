'''<dfn>[http://www.reddit.com/ Reddit]</dfn>''' is a link [[aggregator]] and bulletin board site where community members may submit links and text posts, vote on the submitted entries, and post comments on them. As community members vote a post up or down, the site determines how to position a post within the news feed.

Because of the upvote / downvote system, Reddit is an effective crowd-sourced curation tool where the "best" links (as determined by a particular subreddit's users) are pushed to the top. As a result, sites that have been pushed to Reddit's front page experience huge surges in traffic (also known as "the Slashdot Effect").

== Features ==
The features below are only available to Reddit community members:
