== Data Export ==

* You can use [https://tapiriik.com/ tapiriik] (for free) to sync GPS files between a number of destinations, including a Dropbox folder.
** This will not sync manually created activities.
* Under "Analyze -> Activities", you can select all activities and click on "Export to CSV" (in the bottom left corner). Unfortunately, this only exports the current page of activities, not all activities.
