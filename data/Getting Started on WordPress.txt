By using a [[WordPress]] blog on your own domain, you are already part of the IndieWeb; here is how to '''<dfn>get started with upgrading your IndieWeb support in WordPress</dfn>'''.

== Setup rel=me ==
First thing you need to do to participate with the IndieWeb community is to setup rel=me on your WordPress site so you can sign into the wiki with IndieAuth.

You can setup rel=me in your WordPress blog without editing your theme by adding a custom text widget:
* Go to <code>/wp-admin/widgets.php</code> on your site.
* Scroll down and select <em>Text</em>, and choose a location to add the widget. 
* When you add links to the body of the widget, make sure to include the <code>rel="me"</code> attribute on each one.

You can '''test''' your rel=me setup with:
* [http://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ IndieWebify.Me Web Sign In validator]

Doing this achieves [[indiemark#Level_1|IndieMark Level 1 authentication]], the first IndieMark goal after having your own domain.

== Indieweb Plugin ==
The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ Indieweb] Plugin can help you get set up to be a more active member of the indieweb. 

The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ Indieweb Plugin] is a plugin that helps you install various Indieweb-themed plugins. It is designed for newcomers to quickly get up and running.
* '''[https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/installation/ Install the Indieweb Plugin]'''

(Is this still true? 2016-01-04 {{snarfed}} noted in IRC: "that plugin is kinda deprecated. we now recommend that you install the webmention and semantic-linkbacks plugins individually instead")[https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-01-04/line/1451951820293]

== Send and receive responses with your site ==
Send and receive [[comments]], [[likes]], [[reposts]], and other kinds of post [[responses]] using your own site!

=== Required Plugins ===
Required plugins make receiving indieweb comments and mentions work, recommended plugins further improve the experience.

'''Stable, mature plugins:'''
* '''[[Webmention Plugin]]''' - allows you to send and receive by adding [[webmention]] support to WordPress. Mentions show up as comments on your site. 
* '''[[Semantic Linkbacks]]''' - makes indieweb comments look better on your site, recognizing them as being likes, replies, etc. and displaying appropriately.

'''Alternative:'''
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] a async, WP Cron based webmention sender/receiver supporting reacji, but not doing any comment formatting

Once you have these activated, you can setup [[Bridgy]] to connect your blog to responses from sites such as Facebook and Twitter too, allowing for a seamless experience.

=== Optional Plugins ===

* '''[[Post Kinds Plugin]]''' - adds support for responding to and interacting with other sites
* '''[https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention-for-comments Webmention for (Threaded) Comments]''' - Adds support for threaded comments for webmentions.

== Syndicate your content to other sites ==
Choose one of these different ways to display links for [[POSSE]]/syndicated versions of a post. They cannot both be used. Linking to the syndicated version of a post allows for [[bridgy]] to be able to discover the post as well as for end users to comment on those sites as a way of replying. 

* '''[https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/ Syndication Links]''' - Adds fields to a post to allow manual entry of syndication links. Social, partial support for [[SNAP]], as well as Tumblr CrossPoster, WordPress CrossPoster, and Diaposter(for Diaspora). Also supports rel-me links for [[IndieAuth]].
* '''[https://wordpress.org/plugins/bridgy-publish/ Bridgy Publish]''' - Supports syndication through Bridgy Publish. It pulls reactions (likes, comments etc.) to shared content from the silos back to the site with the original post, as a compatibility mechanism.
* '''WordPress Syndication''' - automatically adds link to a post from a supported syndication plugin. Fully supports Social, partial support for [[SNAP]], and support for Bridgy Publish

== Pull your content from other sites ==
If POSSE is not an option or can't be done for various reasons (see [[Instagram]] for example), you probably still have the possibility if pulling content, automatically creating a "backup" on your site; doing [[PESOS]]. 

Right now the most flexible way to do this on WordPress is the combination of  [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/ Keyring], [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-social-importers/ Keyring Social Importers], and [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-reactions-importer/ Keyring Reactions Importer] plugins. These are a little harder to configure plugins, mainly targeting semi-power-users, but they can import from an impressive amount of services out of the box and it's straightforward to extend their functionality.

== Publish to Your Site with alternative interfaces  ==

* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub Micropub for WordPress] - add support for the [[Micropub]] protocol to WordPress

== Other functionalities ==
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webactions Webactions] - Adds [[webactions]] markup to WordPress elements
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this Indieweb Press-This] - Adds Indieweb markup to the WordPress [https://codex.wordpress.org/Press_This Press-This] bookmarklets to allow you to respond on your site with one-click
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/hum/ Hum URL Shortener] - A personal URL shortener framework
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-shortslug wp-shortslug] - another URL shortener
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieauth Indieauth] - The plugin lets you login to the WordPress backend via [[IndieAuth]]. It uses the URL from the profile page to identify the blog user.

For more information, see [[WordPress Plugins]]

== Themes ==
Some WordPress themes are compatible with [[microformats]].  The Indieweb uses [[microformats2]], the latest version, to mark up sites so that they can be interpreted by other sites when retrieved. Most parsers will fall back onto the older format if available.

Formatting your site so other sites can consume the information allows for the communications Indieweb sites support. For example, a class of u-like-of added to a link to a site you liked to indicates that relationship.

There is only one theme in the WordPress repository that is fully microformats2 compliant. That is [https://wordpress.org/themes/sempress Sempress]. 

For existing themes, you can try out [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 wordpress-uf2], a plugin that tries to add microformats after the fact. Mileage may vary, as a plugin cannot do all that is required.

== Readers ==

* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/blogroll2email/ blogroll2email] - oldschool feed to email reader using the blogroll feature of WordPress; supports RSS, Atom & [[microformats2]] feeds
* [https://github.com/acegiak/WhisperFollow Whisperfollow] see [[Whisperfollow]]

== FAQ ==
; Why does the comment on my site not show the author's information?
; Why does the comment show a link to bridgy.appspot.com instead of the social network?
: Please ensure that you have both the Webmention plugin ''and'' the Semantic Linkbacks plugin installed.
