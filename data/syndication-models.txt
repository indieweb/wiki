= Syndication Models =

Most indieweb publishing flows involve a step involving third party services.

Reasons this is important

* Proliferates your content/links to your content across the web
* Allows people who do not yet have an indieweb presence to catch up with your content
* ...

== Syndication Models ==

* [[POSSE]]: the preferred model, where content is stored under your domain before being pushed elsewhere
* [[PESOS]]: an alternative model, where content is posted to 3rd party services before being archived under your domain
* [[PESETAS]]: an even poorer model, where content is posted to 3rd party services, and aggregated/shared onto a single other silo (rather than your own domain).
