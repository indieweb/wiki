{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Marginalia</dfn>''' are [[interactions]] or [[responses]]  to arbitrary parts of a post, in contrast to a [[comment|traditional comment]] which refers to the entire post.

== How To ==

=== Post ===

On the IndieWeb, marginalia can be posted with the same process as a usual post-level interaction, but with the target URL of the interaction set to a [[fragmention]] of the relevant phrase. For instance, to post a [[reply]] to a phrase "Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams" on http://example.com/kafka set the the <code>in-reply-to</code> URL as <code>http://example.com/kafka##Gregor+Samsa+woke+from+troubled+dreams</code>.

=== Receiving ===

Notifications of marginalia posted by readers on their own site can be received using [[webmention]] sent to a URL containing a fragmention.

=== Display ===

As a first step, marginalia can be displayed as normal post-level comments at the bottom of the post but with a reference/fragmentioned link to the context-phrase.

A better UI is to display received marginalia in context, near the phrase being referred to. Marginalia UI could be coarse-grained to group all marginalia to a particular paragraph together or displayed at a phrase-level. To avoid interrupting the reading flow, some UI to hide/show the relevant marginalia could be provided.

=== Code ===

* [https://github.com/kartikprabhu/marginalia marginalia.js] is a JavaScript tool to move marginalia comments to the correct context in the post and show/hide them. It is released under a MIT license.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* [[User:Kartikprabhu.com| Kartik Prabhu]] on https://kartikprabhu.com
**Posts marginalia replies and sends webmentions, for example, [https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/hollow-icons hollow icons]
**Accepts marginalia on all articles and notes through webmention as of ??, with a JavaScript-based UI to display them in context and show/hide them as of 2014-07-10. Example post: [https://kartikprabhu.com/article/marginalia Marginalia]. 
** On small-viewports the marginalia are shown inline below the context paragraph, while on larger viewports they appear in a sidebar on the left.

* [[User:Joskar.se|Johnny Oskarsson]] on https://joskar.se
** Accepts marginalia replies on all articles and notes if the target of the webmention also contains the fragmention. No changes on the webmention endpoint were needed for this.
** Has implemented a JavaScript-based UI to display marginalia replies as of 2014-10-31. Example post: [https://joskar.se/en/2014/exam-weeks-and-comments-on-the-side Exam weeks and comments on the side].

== Silo Examples ==

=== Medium ===

[http://medium.com Medium] supports paragraph-level comments through a Twitter login. (Screenshots of the article [https://medium.com/cool-code-pal/b21bfc1f63c7] as on 2014-04-16) Posting a comment is triggered by clicking on a "+" sign on the top-right corner of a paragraph.

Similarly, you can read the comments by clicking on the number on the top-right corner. On large screens the annotations appear in a sidebar on the right.

For medium-sized screens the main text slides out of the screen to the left, making room for the sidebar.

For small screens the annotations are displayed in an overlay. Swiping to the left scrolls through the annotations.

On mobile Firefox the overlay additionally includes highlighting on the original content, but breaks on swiping to read next comment.

==== Posting UI ====

Expand: on text selection, Medium shows a "Tweet this sentence" [[interface]]. Could be adapted for posting marginalia.

==== Criticism ====

* Small target links. The buttons for the annotations are too small; being hard to click/tap or accidental click/tap. See [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-04-17/line/1397720432]

* Complete JavaScript dependence: If there is no JavaScript (or it is broken) the reader sees no annotations at all. A good default would be show all the annotations as normal comments below the article.

* Loss of context in the sidebar UI. The main content moves out of the screen and the reader loses context of the main content.
