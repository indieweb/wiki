'''<dfn>[http://webmention.net/draft/ Webmention]</dfn>''' is a simple way to notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receiver's perspective, it's a way to request [[notifications]] when other sites link to it. Webmention is a modern update to [[Pingback]], using only HTTP and x-www-form-urlencoded content rather than XMLRPC requests. Webmention supersedes Pingback.

__TOC__

== Overview ==

A typical Webmention flow is as follows:

# Alice posts some interesting content on her site (which is set up to receive webmentions).
# Bob sees this content and comments about it on his site, linking back to Alice's original post.
# Using Webmention, Bob's publishing software automatically notifies Alice's server that her post has been linked to by the URL of Bob's post.
# Alice's publishing software verifies that Bob's post actually contains a link to her post and then includes this information on her site.

== Protocol Summary ==
{{main|webmention-spec}}

If Aaron's blog supports receiving webmentions, and Barnaby's blog supports sending webmentions, then this is how they interact:

# User Aaron posts a blog post on his blog
# User Barnaby writes post on his blog that links to Aaron's post.
# After publishing the post (i.e. it has a URL), Barnaby's server notices this link as part of the publishing process
# Barnaby's server does webmention discovery on Aaron's post to find its webmention endpoint (if not found, process stops)
# Barnaby's server sends a webmention to Aaron's post's webmention endpoint with 
#* <code>source</code> set to Barnaby's post's permalink
#* <code>target</code> set to Aaron's post's permalink.
# Aaron's server receives the webmention
# Aaron's server verifies that <code>target</code> in the webmention is a valid permalink on Aaron's blog (if not, processing stops)
# Aaron's server verifies that the <code>source</code> (when retrieved, after following redirects) in the webmention contains a hyperlink to the <code>target</code> (if not, processing stops)

Unmentioned but implied (and vaguely mentioned in the pingback spec):

* Aaron's server displays the information about Barnaby's post somewhere on Aaron's post.
* If a <code>u-url</code> is present at the <code>source</code>, then the receiver could use that to markup the display and default to the <code>source</code> if not found.

See [[comment#Accept_a_comment|comment: how to accept a comment]] for more details on accepting comments in general and displaying them.
