<dfn>[https://snowdrift.coop Snowdrift.coop]</dfn> is an in-progress platform for funding Free/Libre/Open projects of all sorts.

The site proposes a many-to-many matching pledge along the lines of ''"I will chip in a tenth of a cent each month for each other supporter who joins me".'' This design intends to solving the ''snowdrift dilemma'', which is a metaphor for the trouble with coordinating collective action to solve social problems (in this case, the problem of funding FLO projects).

Snowdrift.coop is dedicated to the very highest standards of respect for the community from being totally free from proprietary silos to running as a non-profit cooperative.

The site has lots of thorough background research about the concepts, the overall market of existing funding mechanisms and much more.
