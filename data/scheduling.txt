'''<dfn>scheduling</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb, refers to the feature of setting a specific time for a [[post]] to be published in the future. Also known as delayed posting.

=== Brian Suda ===
[[User:Suda.co.uk|Brian Suda]] uses [[WordPress]] to delay posting of his weeknotes until palindromic times since at least 2013-09-27. Example:
* http://optional.is/required/2013/09/27/week-136-137/

=== Tantek ===
[[User:tantek.com|Tantek]] uses [[Falcon]] to post scheduled posts on tantek.com [http://tantek.com/2013/319/t1/falcon-future-posting-working since 2013-11-15]. How it works:
* write post 
* manually set dt-published to the future (ISO date in the markup)
* shows up on home page at that time
Even before it shows up on the home page, the permalink to the future post works which allows sharing [[drafts]] of posts with others on private channels (like IM) for review and feedback and editing before it goes live on the home page.

After it goes live on the home page, the Falcon UI must still be used to explicitly click a button to POSSE the post.

=== Kartik Prabhu ===
[[User:kartikprabhu.com|Kartik]] implements scheduled posting (since 2014-04-27) by manually editing the post date in the Django admin interface. The templates for feeds and post lists then filter only for past posts.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Automatic future POSSE ===
When it comes time to show a future post, should the personal site then also auto-[[POSSE]] it immediately? 

Or maybe delay a bit? (30sec - 5min) to allow the author to edit/undo the future post before its propagated?

=== Scheduled Content ===
Are there use-cases for scheduled content pieces/fragments/sentences/paragraphs within a post rather than the whole post?

That is, have you ever wanted to post a blog post and then then automatically have a new piece of content show-up <em>after</em> a specific date and time?

This would kind of be the inverse of [[expiring content]].
