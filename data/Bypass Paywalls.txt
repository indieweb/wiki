'''<dfn>Bypass Paywalls</dfn>''' is a Firefox addon to bypass paywalls on popular websites - the fact that it's this simple to do it indicates the sites use paywalls for visitors they believe to be humans and not for the ones they think to be search engines and robots; see https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bypasspaywalls/.
