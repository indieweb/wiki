'''<dfn>AMP</dfn>''' is Accelerated Mobile Pages, a [[Google]]-led project that speeds up a subset of HTML through caching and dependencies on google: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml

== IndieWeb Support ==
The pull request https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/499 by {{aaronpk}} adds [[h-entry]] support to AMP example(s) and thus makes AMP more IndieWeb [[friendly]] by default

== Issues ==
=== XML like fragility ===
It appears that initial implementation(s) of AMP HTML consuming code treat it similarly to old XML consuming code, which is to fail in a fragile way, e.g. as noted in https://twitter.com/bryanrieger/status/651782717676216320
