'''<dfn>FTTC</dfn>''' is an acronym for Fiber to the Cabinet; a connectivity technology where a fiber optic connection goes from the exchange to a cabinet several hundred meters away from the premises, where the last leg of the connection is run over traditional copper phone lines. FTTC is a gap-stop technology that can increase internet speeds without installing full fiber to every house.
