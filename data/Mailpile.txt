=== IndieWeb Support ===

Currently Mailpile does not offer any IndieWeb integration, but it will, soon. The ideas being considered are:

* Polling of rel=me to update a users address book
* Email signatures wrapped in [[microformats]]
* Publicly "shared" email conversations are marked up with h-card and such
* Suggest some ideas... :)

=== People Using Mailpile ===

* [[User:Brennannovak.com|Brennan Novak]] (2014) is using Mailpile as his daily email client (will post a URL soon, ish)
