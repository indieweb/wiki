** Venue: [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/eastern Zoom link] will be shown 15 minutes before the event
* HWC: Pacific (10:00 HKT)
** Venue: [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/pacific Zoom link] will be shown 15 minutes before the event

=== In-Person Events ===

There are no plans for one yet; but if there are more  members (and enough interest) in Hong Kong, {{burgeonlab}} is happy to help organize something offline.
