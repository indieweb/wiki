== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of indieweb community members who are using Haskell on their personal sites:

* {{myfreeweb}}'s first engine, [[sweetroll]] 1, used to power [https://unrelenting.technology unrelenting.technology]

== Libraries ==

Developed for Sweetroll:
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/http-link-header http-link-header], a parser for the HTTP Link header
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/microformats2-parser microformats2-parser], a parser for Microformats 2
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/gitson gitson], a Git+JSON storage library 
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/hs-duktape hs-duktape], bindings to [http://duktape.org duktape], a compact [[JavaScript]] engine
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/pcre-heavy pcre-heavy], a usable regular expression library
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/indieweb-algorithms indieweb-algorithms], implementations of algorithms like [[authorship]]

Other useful libraries:
* [https://github.com/yesodweb/haskell-xss-sanitize xss-sanitize], removes any HTML tags that could cause [[xss]] attacks (microformats2-parser uses it by default)
