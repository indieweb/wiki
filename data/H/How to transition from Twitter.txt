'''<dfn>How to transition from Twitter</dfn>''' is an in-progress page providing a step-by-step path to switch from using Twitter to using the IndieWeb instead. 

= How to transition from Twitter to the IndieWeb =

Nearly everything you can do on Twitter, you can do with your own personal site, like posting "tweets" (short notes), liking other posts, reposting other posts, all without the downsides of using Twitter like masquerading bots, misinformation, and harrasment campaigns. Many have successfully made this transition and you can too.

== Easiest ==

=== Paid and supported ===
[[micro.blog]] is an excellent replacement for the positive aspects of Twitter that many of us remember like sharing brief thoughts and thoughtful interactions, supported by a small, sustainable, and very supportive business ($5/month, free 10-day trial to try it out). Watch a 2 min intro:

If you have your own domain you can use it (or a subdomain) with your micro.blog as well!

* Micro.blog is better than Twitter in many ways: https://help.micro.blog/t/what-s-the-difference-between-micro-blog-and-twitter/21
* If you want to keep in touch with Twitter followers, you can setup automatic cross-posting also: https://help.micro.blog/t/automatic-cross-posting-to-twitter-mastodon-and-other-services/860
