''" '''<dfn>[http://web.archive.org/web/20150429220241/https://hidden-id.github.io/ HiddenID]</dfn>''' is a proposed standard for [[Tor]] users to be authenticated and [in the future] peers and service providers would be able to manage internet-wide [https://zzzen.com/hiddenid/?p=36 reputation] of such identities. Such a standard is needed because at the moment, most mainstream internet services [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-arms-helping-internet-services-accept-anonymous-users treat Tor users] like [http://is.gd/criminalizator common criminals] :)"'' [https://dubiousdod.org/indie/2014/11/hiddenid]

Essentially, each user runs an [[OpenID]] server per account. There may be a need for multiple accounts ''"Because a gay communist cancer-patient job-seeker deserves at least 4 identities"'' [https://hidden-id.github.io/#fn3], and one of the purposes of HiddenID is to minimize the risk of unification of those accounts (i.e. partial or ful deanonymization).

The only known HiddenID-friendly site so far is [https://zzzen.com/hiddenid HiddenID Den], a wordpress blog using the
[https://github.com/hidden-id/wordpress-openid#readme HiddenID wordpress plugin]. A HiddenID-friendly [https://github.com/hidden-id/python-openid#readme python-openid fork] is also available (so far there are no servers using it "in the wild"). In both cases, tor must be running on the server (which might be a barrier for many site owners).

Since HiddenID also accepts "classic OpenID" credentials, sites supporting [[IndieAuth]] can use [http://indiewebcamp.com/IndieAuth#Use_IndieAuth_for_your_OpenID OpenID delegation] to login to HiddenID-friendly sites [https://zzzen.com/hiddenid/#comment-26].
