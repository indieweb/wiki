== IndieWeb Compatibility ==
* As of 2016-06-21, the development branch has microformats2 h-cards that seem to have been copied from a [https://github.com/friendica/friendica/pull/2630 Friendica Pull Request]. [https://github.com/redmatrix/hubzilla/commit/2a840460dddb06c99b616b5adc666ee0f39588de HubZilla Commit]
* As of 2016-06-23, the development branch has microformats2 h-entries marked up [https://github.com/redmatrix/hubzilla/pull/433 PR]
* As of 2017-02-15, an experimental module is available for sending webmentions https://github.com/redmatrix/hubzilla-addons/tree/dev/webmention

=== Issues ===
* Comments, while having their own URL, render nearly identical output html.  Thus comment URLs currently have the original post of a thread as the h-entry, not the comment.
* Comments canonical URL are also not on the author's domain, thus could be forged (for microformats consumers)
* Requested Webmention support following W3C REC status, Currently hooks have been added to allow a cron to handle sending webmentions in a plugin. [https://github.com/redmatrix/hubzilla/issues/644 Feature Request Thread]
*Very confusing UI / UX.  Initial creation of an account asks you to name a channel (you never name your account). You can create multiple channels as well.  Finding how to post to the channel is non-obvious.  To delete your account you must delete your channel.
