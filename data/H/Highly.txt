'''<dfn>[https://www.highly.co/ Highly]</dfn>''' wass a [[silo]]-based web app that allowed users to [[highlight]] and save content on web pages and within apps. Highlights on the service are cloud-synced, searchable, and shareable.

* 2020-01-22: Highly emailed users the following note:
<blockquote>Hi!

It's time to say goodbye to Highly. I'm not crying, you're crying.

To keep your highlight collection, you can download it or migrate it to another service ([[Instapaper]] or [[Readwise]]). These export options will be available through next Monday, January 27, after which your collection will be inaccessible and subsequently deleted, and the highlighter and website will no longer work.

Thanks for lighting up the web with us, for all of these years. We’ll see you around the internet.

Happy Highlighting!

== Features ==
* In addition to basic highlighting features, the service allows connecting to reading services like [[Pocket]] and [[Instapaper]]. 
* Highlights can be output as an RSS feed which may assist in creating a [[PESOS]] workflow for posting content to one's website.
* Data export of all highlights as a .csv file
* Bits of the services UI and functionality as well as dovetail with services like Twitter can be found on their defunct Twitter account [https://twitter.com/HighlyTM @HighlyTM]
* [https://medium.com/highlight-to-share Highly blog] hosted on [[Medium]] has several articles that include examples of their UI, functionality, and heatmaps for frequently highlighted passages.
