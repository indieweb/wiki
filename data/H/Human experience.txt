{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Human experience</dfn>''' is a person-focused alternative to the terminology “[[user experience]]” that encompasses both usability and how the experience of using something makes people feel; it is also more aligned with the IndieWeb’s [[tagline]] of a “'''people-focused''' alternative…” ('''Emphasis''' added).

== Thoughts ==
=== replace UX with HX ===
Consider exploring renaming the existing UX (and UI) pages accordingly to HX (and HI) equivalents and long forms, and retaining subsections on UX/UI for historical purposes.

In particular, in the context of this wiki, merging HX into the existing [[UX]] page and then renaming it to [[human experience]] accordingly, relegating prior UX-specific notes/discussion to a historical section.

== Articles ==
