* Troubleshooting: if you get an error like "no tidy :(" then it is likely that the PHP version has been automatically upgraded without re-enabling the php-tidy extension. The fix is to ping an admin and ask them to check the phprc file on the server (likely in ~/.php/7.4/phprc) and see if it has "extension = tidy.so" at the top. If not, edit the file and add it. That should fix it.
