'''<dfn>[https://h2vx.com H2VX]</dfn>''' is a service to convert [[hCard]] microformats to [[vCard]], and [[hCalendar]] microformats to [[iCalendar]].

== Troubleshooting ==
=== no tidy ===
If you see an error like "no tidy :(" then it is likely that the PHP version has been automatically upgraded on the server without re-enabling the php-tidy extension. 

The fix is to ping an admin and ask them to check the <kbd>phprc</kbd> file on the H2VX server (likely at the path <kbd>~/.php/N.M/phprc</kbd> where <samp>N.M</samp> is the PHP version like <kbd>7.4</kbd> or <kbd>8.0</kbd>) and see if it has the line: <blockquote><kbd>extension = tidy.so</kbd></blockquote> If not, edit the <kbd>phprc</kbd> file and add it. That should fix it.
