'''<dfn>[https://hypothes.is Hypothes.is]</dfn>''' is a centralized service and open-source project for [[annotation]] and [[highlight]]s on the web.
== Notes ==
as of 2017-03-18: 
* There seems to be work underway to cleanly split client and server components, which could in the future be useful to use the client with custom IndieWeb sites (e.g. by adding a micropub based transport). [https://groups.google.com/a/list.hypothes.is/forum/#!topic/dev/rjIs8PZawyE]
* the API can return existing annotations in the JSON-LD format specified by the W3C Annotation Spec (but no other part of the protocol is implemented yet)
* There is no way to discover all annotations for a given domain [https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues/2305]
