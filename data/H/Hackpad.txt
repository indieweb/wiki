'''<dfn>[http://hackpad.com Hackpad]</dfn>''' is an interactive collaborative document editing silo that was acquired by [[Dropbox]] and is shutting down on 2017-07-19 ([http://web.archive.org/web/20170428034548/https://hackpad.com/ archived]). Existing users were encouraged in a 2017-04-21 email to try using [[Dropbox Paper]] instead, with the options of importing Hackpad pads into Paper, or exporting your pads into a single zip folder, or do nothing and let pads be automatically migrated to Paper on 2017-07-19, or opt out of automatic migration.
