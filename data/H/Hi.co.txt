== Archive ==
They plan to print a long-lasting archive of the site:
<blockquote>We’re printing — using a microscopic ion-etching process — the entire website upon a 2" × 2" nickel plate, giving it a fire- and saltwater-resistant shelf life of 10,000 years.[¹] At least five plates will be produced, to be held by five stewards — museums and libraries — around the world.<cite>https://medium.com/@craigmod/archiving-our-online-communities-e5868eab4d9a#.sx6vs0b5m</cite></blockquote>
