    '''<dfn>Habari</dfn>''' is a blogging platform written in php. Lightweight by design, but extensible enough to be a full CMS if desired. 

Efforts are under way to incorporate IndieWeb tools and is always looking for developers to assist. Join us in the #habari IRC channel if you want to help or are curious about the project.
