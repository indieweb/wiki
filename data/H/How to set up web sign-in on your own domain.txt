How to setup [[web sign-in]] on your own domain.

== Setup Instructions ==
There are two complementary methods for adding support for web sign-in on your domain. 
__TOC__

=== How to setup IndieAuth ===
A variety of website platforms including WordPress, Known, Drupal, micro.blog, Grav, and others either have built-in support for [[IndieAuth]] or can add it quickly with a plugin or module. If your site can support it you may be able to quickly install, activate, and possibly configure a few settings to enable web sign-in for your website. (If not, try the [[RelMeAuth]] method below.)

See [[IndieAuth#IndieAuth_Providers|IndieAuth Providers]] for a list of supported platforms and links to those plugins and potential directions.

Once you're set up try [https://sso.indieweb.org/login?url=https%3A%2F%2Findieweb.org%2FMain_Page logging in to the indieweb.org wiki] after which you can [[wikify]] yourself.

=== How to setup RelMeAuth ===
==== 1. Link to your social profiles from your home page ====

On your home page, link to your profiles and add the <code>rel="me"</code> attribute to the links.

This may look something like the following:

<pre><ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk" rel="me">@aaronpk on Twitter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk" rel="me">Github</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:me@example.com" rel="me">me@example.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="sms:+15035551212" rel="me">(503) 555-1212</a></li>
</ul></pre>

If you don't want the links to be visible, you can use link elements in the head of your your homepage instead of visible links:

<pre>
<link rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk" />
</pre>

Note that visible links are preferred over invisible data, see [[antipattern#invisible_metadata|antipattern:invisible metadata]] for why.

This wiki uses indielogin.com to authenticate you. See [https://indielogin.com/setup indielogin.com] for a list of which of your services it can use to authenticate you.

==== 2. Link to your home page from each service ====

You'll need to verify that each service has a link back to your home page. For convenience the "edit profile" links for all the supported services are below. You can add alternate URLs in the bio field of these services.

* [https://twitter.com/settings/profile Edit your Twitter profile]
* [https://github.com/settings/profile Edit your Github profile]

Logging in via email address and SMS don’t require you to add links anywhere, but instead verify your identity via email or a short code sent to your phone.

==== 3. You're done! ====

That's it! You're done! Now you can use your domain to sign in to any sites that support [http://microformats.org/wiki/web-sign-in web sign-in]!

Try [https://sso.indieweb.org/login?url=https%3A%2F%2Findieweb.org%2FMain_Page logging in to the indieweb.org wiki] after which you can [[wikify]] yourself.


== Known Issues ==
<!-- * 2014-01-18: It is worth noting that, for setting up your Google+ profile, you have to add your homepage as "Other profile" rather than as (or additional to) "Contributor to" (which is needed for Google authorship). -->
* 2018-06-03: [[RelMeAuth]] using Google+ and Flickr have not worked for a while and were dropped from the recommendations on this page. Since switching the wiki to use [[IndieLogin.com]], refer to that site's documentation for the list of supported authentication mechanisms.
