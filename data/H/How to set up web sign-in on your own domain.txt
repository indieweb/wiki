How to setup [[web sign-in]] on your own domain.

== Setup Instructions ==

=== 1. Link to your various social profiles on your home page ===

On your home page, link to your profiles and add the <code>rel="me"</code> attribute to the links.

This may look something like the following:

<pre><ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk" rel="me">@aaronpk on Twitter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk" rel="me">Github</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://google.com/+aaronpk" rel="me">Google</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:me@example.com" rel="me">me@example.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="sms:+15035551212" rel="me">(503) 555-1212</a></li>
</ul></pre>

If you don't want the links to be visible, you can use link elements in the head of your your homepage instead of visible links:

<pre>
<link rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk" />
</pre>

Note that visible links are preferred over invisible data, see [[antipattern#invisible_metadata|antipattern:invisible metadata]] for why.

This wiki uses indielogin.com to authenticate you. See [https://indielogin.com/setup indielogin.com] for a list of which of your services it can use to authenticate you.

=== 2. On each service, ensure there is a link back to your home page ===

You'll need to verify that each service has a link back to your home page. For convenience the "edit profile" links for all the supported services are below. You can add alternate URLs in the bio field of these services.

* [https://twitter.com/settings/profile Edit your Twitter profile]
* [https://github.com/settings/profile Edit your Github profile]

Logging in via email address and SMS don’t require you to add links anywhere, but instead verify your identity via email or a short code sent to your phone.

=== 3. You're done! ===

That's it! You're done! Now you can use your domain to sign in to any sites that support [http://microformats.org/wiki/web-sign-in web sign-in]!

=== Known Issues ===

* 2014-01-18: It is worth noting that, for setting up your Google+ profile, you have to add your homepage as "Other profile" rather than as (or additional to) "Contributor to" (which is needed for Google authorship).
* …add specific issues here, along with date and solution
* 2018-06-03: Google+ and Flickr have not worked for a while and were dropped from the recommendations on this page. Since switching the wiki to use [[IndieLogin.com]], refer to that site's documentation for the list of supported authentication mechanisms.
