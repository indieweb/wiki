You can also join our [[discuss|chat]] to talk with the community between meetings! üí¨

== Meetings ==
Meetings take place '''every other Wednesday right after work''' in most cities. If it collides with an official holiday in your country, simply skip that one and resume two weeks later as usual.

See '''https://events.indieweb.org''' for specific dates/locations/URLs of upcoming meetings, or this handy summary of upcoming/past dates:

{{Homebrew Website Club}}

__TOC__
=== Regular Meetings  ===

'''Just show up.''' These Homebrew Website Club chapters are well established and meet regularly at least once a month (often fortnightly AKA bi-weekly). If it has been more than a month since a city has met, move them down to popups until a regular pattern is re-established.

Alphabetical by city/region, see each city for regularity.

=== Popups  ===
These cities have held popup Homebrew Website Club meet-ups at least a couple of times recently, and are working hard to get established!

After three consecutive months of successful regular meetings, popups get bumped to Regular meetings! Or if they do not happen for three months, bump them back down to Getting Started.

=== Cities getting started ===
'''Speak up and help make another meetup happen in your city!''' These cities have organizers (can always use more), have (re)started with at least one meeting (hopefully with a photo posted), and would love to hear from you to help make more happen. If it's been more than six months since a meet-up or organizers have all moved to other cities, move a city to "Up-and-coming or needs restarting" in the next section.

== How to Organize Virtual Events ==
Organizers, use the following to keep your Virtual Homebrew Website Club meetups on time and on track.

'''Remember to take and post a photo to the event page!'''

=== Beforehand ===
# Post an [[event]] on https://events.indieweb.org/
#* You can reference or even clone a  [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/hwc/archive recent virtual HWC event] as a starting point
#* If this is the first time you are hosting your meetup, you will need to write your own description for the event. Feel free to use existing pages on the events page as inspiration and to understand the format event pages typically use.
#* Include a link to a unique [[etherpad]] for the event using YYYY-MM-DD format and a short description, e.g. https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2023-01-18-hwc-pacific
#* Use one of the [[#Logos_and_Graphics|HWC Logos and Graphics]] for the event image. The retro image has been a popular one the last several years.
# Invite everyone who attended previous Homebrew Website Club meetups in the event's timezone, those you've invited before, and any friends you know who may be interested in having their own website, upgrading their blog, etc.
#* Use [[invitation]] posts
#* Directly message people 1:1
# ''(Optional)'' Announce your meetup on social media and/or your personal website to get the word out about the event.

=== On the day of the meeting ===

==== Setting up the meeting room ====
* If you are using the IndieWeb Zoom account, familiarize yourself with [[Zoom#Tips_for_Hosts|Zoom - Tips for Hosts]]
** Access to the IndieWeb Zoom account can be requested in the #indieweb-chat channel
** Screen sharing should be set to "Only Host". The host can share their screen to show people's sites during introductions. You may also be able to designate a co-host to handle screen sharing.
** Experimental: Consider [https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0060343#h_d9a04597-0138-4fb9-86cd-81cc4c68b21f enabling in-meeting chat] for hosts and co-hosts only. This will allow hosts and co-hosts to send links to the chat and etherpad, making it easier for attendees to join in the discussion and collaborative notes.
** Start the Zoom meeting 10 minutes before the scheduled start time. The event listing on https://events.indieweb.org will automatically update to include a "Live Now" link that attendees can click to join.
* If you are using a different video service, you will need to update the event listing on https://events.indieweb.org with the link to join.
* Post a message in the #indieweb channel that the meeting is starting

=== Running the event ===
* Welcome
** Direct attendees to https://indieweb.org/discuss for chat options; encourage notes and questions in the main channel instead of in Zoom chat
** Point out the [[code of conduct]] at https://indieweb.org/coc
** Direct attendees to the event's [[Etherpad]] for notes
* Introductions
** Introduce yourself and your site following [[Homebrew_Website_Club#HWC_Broadcast|HWC Broadcast]], then offer each attendee to introduce themselves. Note: attendee videos don't appear in the same order on everyone's screen, so a host should select the order to avoid confusion.
* Group photo: Explain you're taking a group photo (screenshot) that will appear in the event page, [[this-week-in-the-indieweb|This Week in the IndieWeb newsletter]], and the @indiewebcamp [[Twitter]] post. Allow people to turn off their video if they prefer to not be in the photo. 
** In Zoom, choose the option "Hide Non-video Participants" before taking the screenshot.
* Main meetup: This is where the format can vary. Some approaches so far:
** Ask what topics people are interested in discussing, noting them in chat. Then attendees can vote on their preferred priority in chat. Set a timebox for each topic then proceed through each topic.
** Looser, general discussion without timeboxes
** A quiet writing period followed by discussion
* Group photo: if more people joined since the first photo, consider taking another photo
* If you are meeting regularly, announce when the next event will be

=== After the event ===
* Upload the photo to the event permalink on https://events.indieweb.org
** Set the [[alt]] text to something describing the photo, including attendee's names as displayed in the screenshot. Example: "Zoom grid of attendees. Top left to bottom right: name1, name2, name3, and name4"
* Archive the etherpad notes on the wiki, see [[Cali]] for bot commands you can use in chat to do this
* Once you have verified the wiki archive of the notes, edit the event description and change the link to the Etherpad to link to the wiki archive of the notes instead.
* Update the [[:Template:Homebrew Website Club|Homebrew Website Club template]] that display a list of meetups by year
** Add a link to the events site date archive, e.g. <code><nowiki>[https://events.indieweb.org/2022/09/14 09-14]</nowiki></code>
** Add an emoji link to the wiki page that was created when archiving the etherpad, e.g. <code><nowiki>[[events/2022-09-14-hwc-pacific|üåé]]</nowiki></code>
*** Refer to [[cities]] for emojis we've used for your city/region
* Combine notes from the broadcast portion of the meetup into a post
** (Optionally) Syndicate the post to [[IndieNews]]
* Sign out of the organiser's Zoom account (if used)
* If you are meeting regularly, set up the next event on https://events.indieweb.org
** You can clone the current event by selecting the "Edit" menu at the top right and selecting "Clone Event". Don't forget to update dates and links in the new event's description.

== How to Organize ==
Organizers, use the following to keep your in-person Homebrew Website Club meetups on time and on track.

'''Remember to take and post a photo to the event page!'''

=== Beforehand ===
# Get a venue!
# Post an indie [[event]] for your specific meeting city (at your specific venue - if you have one, otherwise post anyway, and add venue when you get it)
#* Link to the IndieWeb wiki page for the event, e.g. like: <blockquote>More information: https://indieweb.org/events/2015-05-20-homebrew-website-club </blockquote>
#* Use an event image like:
#** [https://media.martymcgui.re/c2/4f/7b/1e/711955ef818bde12e2a3e79708ecc9b106d95b460a9fefe93b0be723.jpg Retro Homebrew Website Club JPG]
# Invite everyone who attended previous Homebrew Website Club meetups in your city, and those you've invited before, and any friends you know who may be interested in having their own website, or upgrading their blog etc.
#* Use [[invitation]] posts
#* Directly message people 1:1

=== Optional Domain Name ===
Some cities choose to set up a website to use as well post events to the wiki
* https://www.hwclondon.co.uk [[London]]

==== Optional POSSE Events ====
Optionally post a [[POSSE]] event on:

* [[Upcoming.org]] or any other event sites that might help promote the event

* [[Facebook]]
** Duplicate a previous [[event#POSSE_to_Facebook|Facebook HWC event]] for your city
*** Find the previous FB event for your city
*** Choose "[[create#Duplicate_Event|Duplicate Event...]]" from the [...] button/menu next to the top right "Edit" button 
*** Update references to previous date / wiki page / indie event to post to current one
*** Optionally update or rotate event header photo
** Or create a new FB event (e.g. if duplicating just makes [[create#FB_Something_went_wrong|FB say Something went wrong]]) and:
*** Set the event header photo to a PNG like: 
**** [https://media.martymcgui.re/c2/4f/7b/1e/711955ef818bde12e2a3e79708ecc9b106d95b460a9fefe93b0be723.jpg Retro Homebrew Website Club JPG]
**** I'm attending [https://indieweb.org/images/5/5d/im-attending-indiewebcamp.png] (Note: should be updated to current logo and "Homebrew Website Club")
**** or another clever variant (see previous HWC event wiki pages)
*** Add a brief description from a recent [[next-hwc]]
*** Link to the IndieWeb wiki page for the event, e.g. in the description like: <blockquote>More information: https://indieweb.org/events/2015-05-20-homebrew-website-club </blockquote>
*** Link to your indie event and auth Bridgy with FB to get RSVPs! e.g. in the description  <blockquote>Originally posted at: URL-OF-INDIE-EVENT</blockquote>
*** Keywords: Technology, Digital art

=== Setup ===
* 17:00 arrive at the venue and:
** make sure there is suitable seating for those that have RSVPd
** make or bring a sign that clearly indicates the presence of an IndieWebCamp Homebrew Website Club meeting. If you come up with a nice sign design, please upload it to the wiki!

* 17:20 put the sign out (or put up the IndieWebCamp logo on monitors in the space if any)
** save seats for at least a few of the folks who RSVPd
** consider setting aside a separate room or space for "Conversation Corner" for those that can't help but want to carry on a conversation during Quiet Writing Hour!

* 17:25 test your projector setup to make sure people can show demos of their sites during the "Broadcast" half-hour from 18:30-19:30.

=== Quiet Writing Hour ===
* '''17:30-18:30 optional Quiet Writing Hour''': some locations have started hosting a quiet writing hour from 17:30-18:30 immediately before the meetup itself.
=== HWC Broadcast ===
* '''18:30-19:00: Broadcast''' - take turns with the microphone 1-2 minutes on:
* if this is your first time, introduce yourself, name, URL, what you'd like to do next with your personal site.
* something '''new you created on or for your site''' since the last time you attended
* '''questions''' about anything you're stuck on '''about your personal site'''
* '''notable''' indieweb / ownyourdata related '''press''' / events
=== HWC Group Photo ===
* '''~19:00: Group photo''' - organizers should call time on the "broadcast" phase and then organize and take a group photo to upload to the wiki and embed in the "Photos" section on the page for the specific event. This also helps break-up existing sitting patterns and gives people a chance to move around.

Please be sure to:
* Give folks a heads-up before you take a photo, especially in virtual meetups, to give folks an opportunity to opt-out
* Make sure there are 2+ people who want to be in the photo, otherwise it looks like a meetup by one person with only one person which isn't really a meetup. 
You may omit a photo if there is only one person who wants to be in the photo.

=== HWC Peer to Peer ===
* '''~19:00-19:30: Peer-to-peer''' - encourage everyone to find others they heard in the previous half hour that were interested in similar topics. Help newcomers with [[getting started]] with their personal sites, and hopefully even logging into the wiki and adding themselves to the RSVP section for the meeting!
=== HWC Group Photo 2 ===
* '''~19:30: Group photo''' - If you forgot to take a group photo, or anyone new showed up, use the end of the peer-to-peer session as an opportunity to take another group photo.

=== HWC Clean-up and close ===
* '''~19:45-20:00: Clean-up and meeting closure''' - get everyone to help clean-up and leave the meeting space cleaner than they found it (BarCamp style). Encourage folks to continue discussions at a nearby pub or cafe and get food/drink too!

=== HWC Immediately after ===
* Combine notes from the broadcast portion of the meetup into a post.
** (Optionally) Syndicate the post to [[IndieNews]]
* Add to the event page on the wiki:
** At least one group photo from your meeting.
** Any other wrap-up posts with notes from the meeting.

== Planning Questions ==
In rough order of when a co-organizer might encounter these:
=== Finding a venue ===
How do I find a venue?
* Check out cafes that have an environment where people are sparse and the cafe is ok with hanging out with laptops for an hour or two.

What kind of food venue is works well?
* Cafe style is best, where you order at the counter separately, and can come and go independently.
* Wifi is a nice to have (or get someone to bring a mifi hotspot and share)
* Power outlets are also a nice to have

=== Adding to the wiki ===
How should a co-organizer add a HWC-event to the wiki?

We are now using https://events.indieweb.org/ for HWC-events!

The easiest is to clone an existing event, e.g.:
* Find the most recent HWC in your city in https://events.indieweb.org/archive
* Click the drop-down next to "Edit" on the right and choose "Clone Event"
* Edit the event details to fix the date, confirm the time & venue, update the description
* Save!

If there isn't a previous HWC event in your city, feel free to clone from another HWC event, e.g.:
* https://events.indieweb.org/2020/03/homebrew-website-club-san-francisco-KTBJlSw7JJKm

=== Promoting an HWC event ===
How do I promote an HWC event? 
* Invite participants from previous HWC events in the same city.
* Invite participants from [[IndieWebCamps]] from that city

There are several [[#Logos_and_Graphics|logos and graphics]] you can use in your promotions.

=== Promoting Regular HWC Meetups ===

Some organizers have found it useful to create a separate web and social media presence for their group. This allows potential attendees to stay up-to-date on upcoming events without needing to follow the organizers' feeds, and (potentially) allows multiple organizers to manage announcements and marketing. 

==== Examples of HWC sites and social media accounts ====

* [[HWC#London|HWC London]] has a [https://hwclondon.co.uk/ standalone website] and [https://twitter.com/HWCLondon Twitter account].
* [[Baltimore|HWC Baltimore]] has a [https://twitter.com/HWCBaltimore Twitter account].

=== What to bring ===
What should I bring to the meetup?
* A sign saying Homebrew Website Club might be helpful

=== How to wrap up ===
* '''Make sure to take a photo''' and upload it to the event on events.indieweb.org!
** There's a convenient "Add Photo" option in the drop-down menu next to "Edit" in the top right of the event page.
* Let folks know you have to wrap up, and either
** If the venue is public like a cafe, encourage them to stay as long as they like
** If you‚Äôre the venue host like in an office, provide suggestions of nearby eating and drinking places where folks can continue discussions and perhaps grab a snack

=== Ask Organizers ===
Got more questions?
* Ask active community members who (help) organize (or have organized) Homebrew Website Club meetups, e.g. in IRC, or in-person at a meetup!

== History ==
[[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] was inspired after attending the Homebrew Computer Club 38th Reunion and set up the [http://tantek.com/2013/322/b1/homebrew-computer-club-reunion-inspiration first meeting 2013-11-20 in San Francisco].

Homebrew Website Club meetups were founded with the same structure as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club classic Homebrew Computer Club] meetings, for anyone passionate about or interested in creating, improving, building, designing their own website!

== Brainstorming ==
=== Online Format ===
With the COVID-19 pandemic, IndieWeb meetups have moved to online formats. [[Organizer]]s have been rotating organizing duties and are experimenting with different formats. Here are some of my notes from the last few weeks: <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/3473/profile-2016-med.jpg}}  [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 14:35, 8 April 2020 (PDT)

* Familiarize yourself with [[Zoom#Tips_for_Hosts|Zoom - Tips for Hosts]]
** Screen sharing should be set to "Only Host". The host can share their screen to show people's sites during introductions. You may also be able to designate a co-host to handle screen sharing.
* Welcome
** Direct attendees to https://indieweb.org/discuss for chat options; encourage notes and questions in the main channel instead of in Zoom chat
** Point out the [[code of conduct]]
* Introductions
** Introduce yourself and your site following [[Homebrew_Website_Club#HWC_Broadcast|HWC Broadcast]], then offer each attendee to introduce themselves. Note: attendee videos don't appear in the same order on everyone's screen, so a host should select the order to avoid confusion.
* Group photo: Explain you're taking a screenshot for the event page and the weekly newsletter, allowing people to turn their video on or off as they prefer.
* Main meetup: This is where the format can vary. Some approaches so far:
** Ask what topics people are interested in discussing, noting them in chat. Then attendees can vote on their preferred priority in chat. Set a timebox for each topic then proceed through each topic.
** Looser, general discussion without timeboxes
** A quiet writing period followed by discussion
* Group photo: if more people joined since the first photo, consider taking another photo

=== Appearance refresh or new site ===
Would it be helpful to do a refresh of this page as a reference, or perhaps a separate site entirely like:
* http://uxhappyhour.com
Which has a similar list of active cities, how to start your own, but presented much more simply.

== Archived ==
=== Past Description ===
Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy?

Come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends who want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project...

* Finish that blog post you‚Äôve been writing!
* Discuss difficult and/or open ended questions that you ran into!
* Demos of recent IndieWeb breakthroughs, share what you've gotten working!
* Whatever you want!

See the [http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter Homebrew Website Club Newsletter Volume 1 Issue 1] for a description of the first meeting.

=== HWC 2016 ===
This is an archive of the HWC 2016 planning, [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Planning&oldid=50980#HWC_2016 originally found here].
----

<span id="HWC">2016 [[Homebrew Website Club]]</span> start date! Should we start the 2016 HWC meetups on:
* <s>2016-01-06 only one week after 2015-12-30, </s>
** but avoids having a meetup land the day before US Thanksgiving
** 0 {{t}} ok with this. no longer any preference.
** 0 {{gRegor}} OK with this. Not attending an HWC currently so does not impact me.
* '''2016-01-13 two weeks after 2015-12-30''', 
** but collides with Wednesday before US Thanksgiving thus unlikely to have much (any) participation at US venues.
** 0 {{t}} ok with this.

Based on lack of strong input on this, we are going with the default continuing every two weeks from 2015-12-30 and '''starting 2016 HWC with 2016-01-13.''' - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 14:56, 23 December 2015 (PST) (updated, no objections, going with this plan. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 07:51, 31 December 2015 (PST))

Getting some feedback that pages on organizing HWC hard to find, I think it maybe best to make a new page that is an HWC toolkit and port most of this content over. 

At top of this page put two buttons one "Attend an HWC" and another "Organize an HWC"
