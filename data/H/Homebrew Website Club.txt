<dfn>'''Homebrew Website Club'''</dfn> is a bi-weekly meetup of people passionate about or interested in creating, improving, building, designing their own website, in the same structure as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club classic Homebrew Computer Club] meetings.

== Description ==
Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy?

Come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends who want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project...

* Finish that blog post you’ve been writing!
* Discuss difficult and/or open ended questions that you ran into!
* Demos of recent IndieWeb breakthroughs, share what you've gotten working!
* Whatever you want!

See the [http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter Homebrew Website Club Newsletter Volume 1 Issue 1] for a description of the first meeting.

== Meetings ==
Meetings take place '''every other Wednesday right after work, 18:30-19:30'''. If it collides with an official holiday in your country, simply skip that one and resume two weeks later as usual.

See [[events]] for specific dates/locations/URLs of upcoming meetings, or this handy summary of upcoming/past dates:

'''Remember to take and post a photo to the event page!'''

# Get a venue!
# Post an indie [[event]] for your specific meeting city (at your specific venue - if you have one, otherwise post anyway, and add venue when you get it)
#* Link to the IndieWeb wiki page for the event, e.g. like: <blockquote>More information: https://indieweb.org/events/2015-05-20-homebrew-website-club </blockquote>
#* Use an event image like:
#** [https://media.martymcgui.re/c2/4f/7b/1e/711955ef818bde12e2a3e79708ecc9b106d95b460a9fefe93b0be723.jpg Retro Homebrew Website Club JPG]

#* Use [[invitation]] posts
#* Directly message people 1:1


==== Optional POSSE Events ====
Optionally post a [[POSSE]] event on:

* [[Upcoming.org]] or any other event sites that might help promote the event

* [[Facebook]]
** Duplicate a previous [[event#POSSE_to_Facebook|Facebook HWC event]] for your city
*** Find the previous FB event for your city
*** Choose "[[create#Duplicate_Event|Duplicate Event...]]" from the [...] button/menu next to the top right "Edit" button 
*** Update references to previous date / wiki page / indie event to post to current one
*** Optionally update or rotate event header photo
** Or create a new FB event (e.g. if duplicating just makes [[create#FB_Something_went_wrong|FB say Something went wrong]]) and:
*** Set the event header photo to a PNG like: 
**** [https://media.martymcgui.re/c2/4f/7b/1e/711955ef818bde12e2a3e79708ecc9b106d95b460a9fefe93b0be723.jpg Retro Homebrew Website Club JPG]
**** I'm attending [https://indieweb.org/images/5/5d/im-attending-indiewebcamp.png] (Note: should be updated to current logo and "Homebrew Website Club")
**** or another clever variant (see previous HWC event wiki pages)
*** Add a brief description from a recent [[next-hwc]]
*** Link to the IndieWeb wiki page for the event, e.g. in the description like: <blockquote>More information: https://indieweb.org/events/2015-05-20-homebrew-website-club </blockquote>
*** Link to your indie event and auth Bridgy with FB to get RSVPs! e.g. in the description  <blockquote>Originally posted at: URL-OF-INDIE-EVENT</blockquote>
*** Keywords: Technology, Digital art

=== Setup ===
* 17:00 arrive at the venue and:
** make sure there is suitable seating for those that have RSVPd
** make or bring a sign that clearly indicates the presence of an IndieWebCamp Homebrew Website Club meeting. If you come up with a nice sign design, please upload it to the wiki!

* 17:20 put the sign out (or put up the IndieWebCamp logo on monitors in the space if any)
** save seats for at least a few of the folks who RSVPd
** consider setting aside a separate room or space for "Conversation Corner" for those that can't help but want to carry on a conversation during Quiet Writing Hour!

* 17:25 test your projector setup to make sure people can show demos of their sites during the "Broadcast" half-hour from 18:30-19:30.

=== Quiet Writing Hour ===
* '''17:30-18:30 optional Quiet Writing Hour''': some locations have started hosting a quiet writing hour from 17:30-18:30 immediately before the meetup itself.
=== HWC Broadcast ===
* '''18:30-19:00: Broadcast''' - take turns with the microphone 1-2 minutes on:
* if this is your first time, introduce yourself, name, URL, what you'd like to do next with your personal site.
* something '''new you created on or for your site''' since the last time you attended
* '''questions''' about anything you're stuck on '''about your personal site'''
* '''notable''' indieweb / ownyourdata related '''press''' / events
=== HWC Group Photo ===
* '''~19:00: Group photo''' - organizers should call time on the "broadcast" phase and then organize and take a group photo to upload to the wiki and embed in the "Photos" section on the page for the specific event. This also helps break-up existing sitting patterns and gives people a chance to move around.
=== HWC Peer to Peer ===
* '''~19:00-19:30: Peer-to-peer''' - encourage everyone to find others they heard in the previous half hour that were interested in similar topics. Help newcomers with [[getting started]] with their personal sites, and hopefully even logging into the wiki and adding themselves to the RSVP section for the meeting!
=== HWC Group Photo 2 ===
* '''~19:30: Group photo''' - If you forgot to take a group photo, or anyone new showed up, use the end of the peer-to-peer session as an opportunity to take another group photo.

=== HWC Clean-up and close ===
* '''~19:45-20:00: Clean-up and meeting closure''' - get everyone to help clean-up and leave the meeting space cleaner than they found it (BarCamp style). Encourage folks to continue discussions at a nearby pub or cafe and get food/drink too!

=== HWC Immediately after ===
* Combine notes from the broadcast portion of the meetup into a post.
** (Optionally) Syndicate the post to [[IndieNews]]
* Add to the event page on the wiki:
** At least one group photo from your meeting.
** Any other wrap-up posts with notes from the meeting.

== Planning Questions ==
In rough order of when a co-organizer might encounter these:
=== Finding a venue ===
How do I find a venue?
* Check out cafes that have an environment where people are sparse and the cafe is ok with hanging out with laptops for an hour or two.

What kind of food venue is works well?
* Cafe style is best, where you order at the counter separately, and can come and go independently.
* Wifi is a nice to have (or get someone to bring a mifi hotspot and share)
* Power outlets are also a nice to have

=== Adding to the wiki ===
How should a co-organizer add a HWC-event to the wiki?

* Two choices:
*# If your HWC is (preferably) on the same date as the "usual" HWC, add your city to the existing event page!
*# Otherwise if your HWC meetup is on a different date, then clone an existing HWC event page, change details as needed for yours, and [https://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?title=Template:Homebrew_Website_Club&action=edit add it to the index on Homebrew_Website_Club]

And then follow:
* [[Events#How_To_Add_An_Event]]

=== Promoting an HWC event ===
How do I promote an HWC event? 
* Invite participants from previous HWC events in the same city.
* Invite participants from [[IndieWebCamps]] from that city

There are several [[#Logos_and_Graphics|logos and graphics]] you can use in your promotions.

=== Promoting Regular HWC Meetups ===

Some organizers have found it useful to create a separate web and social media presence for their group. This allows potential attendees to stay up-to-date on upcoming events without needing to follow the organizers' feeds, and (potentially) allows multiple organizers to manage announcements and marketing. 

==== Examples of HWC sites and social media accounts ====

* [[HWC#London|HWC London]] has a [https://hwclondon.co.uk/ standalone website] and [https://twitter.com/HWCLondon Twitter account].
* [[Baltimore|HWC Baltimore]] has a [https://twitter.com/HWCBaltimore Twitter account].

=== What to bring ===
What should I bring to the meetup?
* A sign saying Homebrew Website Club might be helpful

=== Ask Organizers ===
Got more questions?
* Ask active community members who (help) organize (or have organized) Homebrew Website Club meetups, e.g. in IRC, or in-person at a meetup!

== Brainstorming ==
=== Appearance refresh or new site ===
Would it be helpful to do a refresh of this page as a reference, or perhaps a separate site entirely like:

Which has a similar list of active cities, how to start your own, but presented much more simply.

This is an archive of the HWC 2016 planning, [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Planning&oldid=50980#HWC_2016 originally found here].
----

<span id="HWC">2016 [[Homebrew Website Club]]</span> start date! Should we start the 2016 HWC meetups on:
* <s>2016-01-06 only one week after 2015-12-30, </s>
** but avoids having a meetup land the day before US Thanksgiving
** 0 {{t}} ok with this. no longer any preference.
** 0 {{gRegor}} OK with this. Not attending an HWC currently so does not impact me.
* '''2016-01-13 two weeks after 2015-12-30''', 
** but collides with Wednesday before US Thanksgiving thus unlikely to have much (any) participation at US venues.
** 0 {{t}} ok with this.

Based on lack of strong input on this, we are going with the default continuing every two weeks from 2015-12-30 and '''starting 2016 HWC with 2016-01-13.''' - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 14:56, 23 December 2015 (PST) (updated, no objections, going with this plan. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 07:51, 31 December 2015 (PST))

Getting some feedback that pages on organizing HWC hard to find, I think it maybe best to make a new page that is an HWC toolkit and port most of this content over. 

At top of this page put two buttons one "Attend an HWC" and another "Organize an HWC"
