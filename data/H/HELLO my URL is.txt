{{stub}}

<dfn>HELLO my URL is</dfn> is a parody of the typical "HELLO my name is" nametag that was popularized at early SXSW Interactive festivals where most of the participants had their own web site (URL) and actively blogged on it (before the rise of popular [[silos]]) and most recently is on a t-shirt you can buy to express your place on the IndieWeb: https://teespring.com/my-url-is .
