<blockquote>“Hootsuite Inc. chief executive officer Irina Novoselsky defended the Vancouver tech company’s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the United States, telling employees the deal will stand so long as the agency abides by the terms of service.

...

‘We did nothing wrong here,’ Ms. Novoselsky told employees. ‘ICE is a customer within the public affairs group, so we help them from our social-media management perspective.’”</blockquote>
