** "Of course, when I mention HTML and content, it should be understood with all the nuance that is implied, from well-structured and written content, image captions, accessibility parameters, tidy and well-structured syntax, not only responsive but adaptive data + microformats."

** "The more I look at #webdev as a not-full-time practitioner, the more I start to appreciate what I think of as the #indieweb position: <br/>The basic document structure of the web is #HTML. <br/>The basic layout engine is #CSS. <br/>The more that a framework leverages these things directly--puts them in front of code authors and also expresses them clearly in its output, the better it is. <br/>The more a framework hides or misrepresents them or doesn't engage with their semantics, the worse it is." <br/><cite>[https://indieweb.social/@raphaelluckom @raphaelluckom] December 8, 2022</cite>
