https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_OpenID_on_your_own_domain

Different methods to set up [[OpenID]] on your own domain.

= Delegate to external authenticator =

== Delegating to indieauth.com ==
{{warning|The indieauth.com service is deprecated, so you may not want to use this. Read more on the [[indieauth.com]] page}}

See [[OpenID#Setup]]

== Delegating your domain to stackexchange ==

You can use your stackexchange account as an authentication mean for your own website. To set this up, add the following markup into your page's head section:

<pre>
  <!-- OpenID-2.0 delegated to stackexchange -->
  <link rel="openid2.provider" href="https://openid.stackexchange.com/openid/provider" />
  <link rel="openid2.local_id" href="https://openid.stackexchange.com/user/xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx" />
</pre>

Replacing xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx with whatever url corresponds to your user (log in into openid.stackexchange.com and select 'Use your own URL to log in' to find it out).

== Delegating your domain to openid.org.cn ==

<pre>
  <!-- OpenID-2.0 delegated to openid.org.cn -->
  <link rel="openid2.provider openid.server" href="http://openid.org.cn/server" />
  <link rel="openid2.local_id openid.delegate" href="http://xxx.openid.org.cn/" />
</pre>

Replace xxx with your account name at openid.org.cn

= Install authenticator on your own server =

This is the most secure setup as you'll be in control of the way you authenticate.

== SimpleID ==

One option is to install [http://simpleid.koinic.net/ SimpleID] on your server.
It is a simple OpenID provider implemented in PHP, also packaged for popular free software distribution.

== GNU social ==

Another option is installing a [[GNU social]] node, which comes with an OpenID provider, and use that.

== Wordpress ==

[[Wordpress]] can behave as an OpenID provider with this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/openid/

== Other options ==

You can read about some other options here:

= Troubleshooting =
If even after setting up OpenID or delegation, signing-in doesn't appear to work:

* If you're running WordPress - see if you have the WP-SuperCache plugin and delete the cache or turn off caching. 
* Verify that when you load your site in your browser, you can view source and see the OpenID delegation <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> (and <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>) tags.
* Be sure that you've changed "username" in those tags to your own specific username on the OpenID service.

= History =
In early indieweb days, a strong point was made of [[selfdogfood]]ing to filter out unproductive conversation. At the time, setting up [[OpenID]] on your own domain was a key component of that.

<blockquote>
You must be ''this'' independent in order to contribute:
# you must have your own domain, and 
# have figured out how to set-up [[OpenID]] on it.

Here are a couple of options for #2.
* Easy: delegate your domain to another OpenID provider like myOpenID
* Harder: setup your server to be an OpenID provider
