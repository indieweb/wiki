'''<dfn>[https://gohugo.io Hugo]</dfn>''' is a [[static site generator]] written in [[Go]]. It is designed to build a site based on [[markdown]] files with header information in YAML or TOML. It uses Go templates and compiles a full site very rapidly. No built-in IndieWeb support, but adding [[microformats]] to templates is relatively straightforward.

== Migrating to Hugo ==
=== From WordPress ===
There is a small nifty [https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter wordpress-to-hugo-exporter plugin for Wordpress], which exports Posts and Pages from a [[WordPress]] site into a files and directories hierarchy ready to be used with Hugo (one would still need to configure/create a theme, etc. before being able to actually compile the site).

''Tested at [[2016/Brighton|IndieWebCamp Brighton 2016]] by [[User:mey.vn|hotzeplotz]] on WordPress 4.6.1, worked perfectly (exporting around 7MB of post/pages and media to a zip file in <1 second, with content then compiled by Hugo in 150ms!)''

=== Importing a Twitter Archive ===
[https://skippy.net/ skippy] has created a rudimentary Python script to [https://github.com/skpy/twitter-granary-hugo/ convert a Twitter export into Markdown], for use with Hugo.  It relies on [[granary]] to manipulate the raw Twitter JSON.
