'''<dfn>Heartbleed</dfn>''' was a [[security]] vulnerability announced 2014-04-08 in OpenSSL, a common open source library used in [[https]] connections. 

The vulnerability has been widespread since 2012-03-14 when OpenSSL version 1.0.1 (with the bug) was released.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed#History] Any software or services which incorporated or updated OpenSSL since that date may have been (still be) vulnerable.

This page is for the indieweb community to keep track of various services and software that anyone in the community may have been using that was vulnerable to Heartbleed but has been patched since - please add to it.

Please add any software that was vulnerable to Heartbleed but which has been patched AND you've already updated your install thereof (or your service provider has).

== Sites claiming no sign of attack ==
The following sites and services reported no signs of being targeted or otherwise attacked due to this vulnerability, but did explicitly provide notice to users anyway, typically with a caveat of maybe it happened and we didn't know, and thus still recommended change of passwords:
* [[Sonic.net]] - 2014-04-10 email to users: <blockquote><p>Subject: Protect your privacy: Heartbleed bug</p><p>Protect yourself against the Heartbleed bug: change your passwords!</p><p>Early this week a severe vulnerability in OpenSSL known as the Heartbleed bug was announced. Sonic.net is joining many other providers and recommending that you change your passwords for each your online services. [...] Do not forget to <strong>change your ISP and email account passwords!</strong> [...] </p><p><strong>We do not have any reason to believe that we, or any of our users, were targeted.  However, this attack was undetectable</strong>. and the cautious response is to <strong>assume that sensitive information has been leaked.</strong></p></blockquote> <strong>Strong emphasis</strong> added. Note that Sonic.net <em>is</em> an ISP so when they're suggesting you "change your ISP ... passwords" they are by implication including themselves.
