{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://news.ycombinator.com/ Hacker News]</dfn>''' is a [[bookmark]] posting [[silo]] as well as a [[silo]] for [[comments]] on those links. Previously Hacker News was described as a link [[aggregator]], however that implies a level of automation which it lacks. Links are manually posted on Hacker News by humans, and thus resemble [[bookmark]] posts more than aggregation.

== Features ==
* [[login]]
* [[bookmark]] posts, which you can then interact with:
** [[like]] - called [[upvote]] in their UI.
*** number of likes/upvotes of the post displayed as "points"
** [[comment]], which you can then interact with:
*** [[like]] 
**** number of likes of the comment displayed as "points"
*** [[comment]], which you can then interact with again, recursively.

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE to Hacker News ===
If you post [[bookmark]] posts, you could [[POSSE]] them to Hacker News, if you have an account there.

If you post to Hacker News, you should consider posting [[bookmark]] posts to your own site instead, and then POSSEing to Hacker News.

Examples:
* 2012-10-07 {{aaronpk}} https://aaronparecki.com/2012/10/07/1/providing-apis-for-content-driven-websites
** POSSE copy: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4624105

=== POSSE replies to Hacker News ===
If you post comments on Hacker News, you should consider instead posting a [[reply]] on your own site, and then POSSEing that reply to Hacker News.

Examples:
* 2017-06-08 {{aaronpk}} https://aaronparecki.com/2017/06/08/9/indieweb
** POSSE copy: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14516923

=== POSSE likes to Hacker News ===
If you upvote posts or comments on Hacker News, you should consider instead posting [[like]] posts on your own site, and then POSSEing those likes as upvotes to Hacker News.

=== Backfeed responses on Hacker News ===
If you POSSE to Hacker News, you should also backfeed any responses (replies, votes) back to your original post. No known examples (yet).

=== Bridgy Support ===
There is no known Bridgy support to POSSE (e.g. [[bookmark]], [[comment]], or [[like]]) posts to Hacker News or backfeed responses (yet). Upvote or help implement:
