{{stub}}
<dfn>'''[http://flask.pocoo.org/ Flask]'''</dfn> is a minimal [[Python]] framework for writing web applications. It provides regex-based URL routing, templating via Jinja2, and request/response handling. Additional functionality is provided via extensions (e.g., ORM via Flask-SQLAlchemy). Because of its minimalism and flexibility, Flask is popular for writing API endpoints for larger applications.
