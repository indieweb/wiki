'''<dfn>promoted</dfn>''' is a label indicating that some content, an account, or a hashtag has been artificially raised in prominence (typically by [[payment]]), usually in a [[silo]].

== Silo Examples ==
=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] has allows several promoted things:
==== promoted tweet ====
A <dfn>promoted tweet</dfn> is a [[post]] on [[Twitter]] that the author has chosen to pay Twitter to show in various places on Twitter that it either would not otherwise be displayed (like a stream of followings tweets), or be given preferential display treatment, such as the top of some search results.

==== promoted account ====
A <dfn>promoted account</dfn> is similar to a promoted tweet in that a (the latest?) tweet from an account is shown in places it would not otherwise be shown, or is given preferential display. 

E.g. in followings stream:

The tweet above from @JohnLegere appears to be a promoted tweet, however the addition of the explicit full name near the promoted icon and text in the lower left and [[follow|Follow]] button in the lower right all underneath a horizontal rule below the tweet itself but still in the box containing the tweet indicate that it is a promoted account.

Also in [[who to follow]] box:
