== Read Wikipedia Tips ==
For now, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual_coordination Wikipedia page on Multilingual coordination], and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/How_to_start_a_new_Wikipedia How to start a new Wikipedia] for some good general tips, advice, and community conventions.

== Pages To Start With ==
You may want to start with the list of [[stable-pages]], which are pages that are relatively stable, and have only minimal/editorial changes, which makes them much easier to keep in sync with the English versions, by using the [[Special:Watchlist|my watchlist]] feature (use it to watch the pages you've translated for changes).

== Page naming convention ==
Page naming: for the translated version of a page, use the same name for the page, and simply add the RFC 3066 language identifier code as a dash suffix. E.g. for the French version, [[Main_Page]] becomes [[Main_Page-fr]], and [[why]] becomes [[why-fr]].
