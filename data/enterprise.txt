An '''<dfn>enterprise</dfn>''' is a large, interconnected business that is made of individual units or departments. [http://blogs.gartner.com/mark_mcdonald/2009/06/15/is-your-company-an-enterprise-the-answer-matters/ According to Gartner], some defining characteristics include:

* The overall business strategy arises from the individual units working together
* Employees think of themselves as belonging to a larger company than their unit
* The business is financially connected: underperformance in one unit affects the others
* Units share some resources (like software tools) between them
* There are rules and metrics that apply across the entire business

In other words, enterprise is a way of saying "a big company". Institutions like universities are often thought of as being enterprises, too.

Enterprise standards are often far too complicated, over-engineered and built around the needs of technology vendors like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle etc. rather than based around the needs of individual users.
