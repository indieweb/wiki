'''<dfn>XMPP-FTW</dfn>''' is a Javascript library to allow browser developers access to the core XMPP protocols using JSON instead of XML.

The library defines hooks for all of the core XMPP events which may be generated by either the client or the server and then sends JSON to the hook's callback.
