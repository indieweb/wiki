{{stub}}

'''<dfn>x-apple-data-detectors</dfn>''' is an [[Apple]] URL scheme seen in an error message after clicking on text in a Notes app text note that it auto-linked due to overly aggressively “data detector” text matching, then errantly copied as a link from one note to a shared note, which when clicked in MacOS does not resolve due to a proprietary scheme and path ID dependent on source context; avoid such [[anti-patterns]] in [[auto-link]] functions.

== Error ==
Example error message:<br/>
[[File:2024-05-05-macos-x-apple-data-detectors-error.png]]
<blockquote>There is no application set to open the URL x-apple-data-detectors://embedded-result/nnn</blockquote> where "nnn" is a 3 digit number that clearly is an index into a device-local database and is thus useless in another context such as another device.

== Anti-patterns ==
Anti-patterns from such [[Apple]] auto-linking:
* proprietary URL scheme (even “x-” at that)
* URL segment dependent on device-only info: path identifier segment dependent on a device-local database row, unresolvable when such content is shared in another context, e.g. via a shared note, or if copy/pasted into a message
* mixing code generated content and author content: copying an auto-link URL as if it was part of the source content and then pasting it, instead of preserving author-created text only, and instead designing for lazy auto-linking at the destination
