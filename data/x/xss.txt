<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Cross-site scripting</dfn>''' (abbreviated <abbr>XSS</abbr>) is a [[security]] vulnerability that makes it possible for anyone to inject client-side [[JavaScript]] into web pages using URL query strings, comments, [[webmention]]s, etc.</span>

==XSS from webmentions==

If you have implemented [[webmention]]s on your site, you should be aware of XSS attacks.

I've (possibly KB Sriram https://github.com/kbsriram) put up a [https://checkmention.appspot.com little appengine service] that can send dubious webmentions to your site so you can test how the code handles them. The source is [https://github.com/kbsriram/checkmention on github] - please do add additional tests and patches.

[https://github.com/voxpelli/node-webmention-testpinger node-webmention-testpinger] includes XSS test cases too.

==Mitigations==

OWASP has a [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet good summary] of preventative measures.

===HTML sanitization===

You should use a library that only allows whitelisted HTML tags and CSS properties.

* [[Python]]: [https://github.com/jsocol/bleach bleach]
* [[Ruby]]: [https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize Sanitize], [https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah Loofah] or [http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html the built-in Rails helper]
* [[Haskell]]: [https://github.com/yesodweb/haskell-xss-sanitize xss-sanitize] (automatically used by [https://github.com/myfreeweb/microformats2-parser microformats2-parser])

===Additional browser-based mitigation===

You may send a [[Content-Security-Policy]] HTTP header, which works as a whitelist for JavaScript/CSS/iframes/etc. If you have a CSP header that doesn't allow inline scripts and scripts from untrusted domains, the browser won't execute scripts injected via XSS.

==Test cases for handling webmention-related code==

If you prefer, this can be hosted somewhere, and used as the "source" for a webmention. Update the in-reply-to tag as appropriate, and ensure that any markup that you extract into your site remains "safe".
