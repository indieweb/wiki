'''<dfn>Heroku Deploy Button</dfn>''' is a link that can be put on any webpage that deploys a GitHub repo to Heroku with one click.

It can be any '''a''' tag with the '''href''' of: 
https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/darkmatterapp/publisher-server-rails

The URL argument of '''template''' can be used to point to a specific GitHub repo URL.
If the  URL argument of '''template''' isn't included than Heroku will try to use the '''referrer''' header to figure out what to deploy. For example, from a README on a GitHub repo.
