    A '''<dfn>habit tracker</dfn>''' is a tool to track one's progress in adopting new habits. It is different from [[lifestreaming|activity tracking]], in that a habit tracker gives insights that help to change an activity. 

== Challenges ==

* Just a list of dates with a 'yes' or 'no' seems too simple for a habit tracker. A dishwashing habit, for example, only matters when there are dishes. When someone eats out, the dishwashing habit can be marked 'irrelevant' on that day.
