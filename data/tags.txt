'''<dfn>tags</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>tagging</dfn>''' refers to categorizing or labeling content, your own or others ([[tag-reply]]), with words, phrases, names, or other information, optionally linked to specific people, events, locations, such as the practice of tagging [[posts]] being about certain people ([[person-tag]]), like tagging people or other items where ([[area-tag]]) they're depicted in a [[photo]].

Even HTML angle-bracket "tags" are a way to label plain text as having a specific meaning (like a heading), more information (a hyperlink), or some interactive function (like a button).

__TOC__
== Why ==
Why tag posts, both yours, and others, and why [[person-tag]] too.
=== Refindability ===
Tagging something helps you find it again in the future when you're searching on that topic (the tags you used), e.g. searching on your own site for a subject.
=== Surfacing ===
Tagging something helps it show up when others search on that topic (either on your site, or on silos via your [[POSSE]] copies), and in particular, surfacing that something to people that you know are actively searching on a topic, e.g. like a recent/popular news item.
=== Social ===
Person-tagging someone in a post is a social gesture saying publicly that the post is about them, and thus indicating in a (likely) positive way that you're thinking of them.

Person-tagging a [[photo]] is a small (likely) positive social gesture that you saw them in a photo and thought of them.

== How to ==
=== mark up and post a tag reply ===
To post a "tag reply", the reply post's [[h-entry]] MUST hyperlink to the permalink of the thing that is being tagged, with <code>class="u-tag-of"</code>. E.g.
<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-entry"> ... 
 Alice tagged 
 <a class="u-tag-of u-in-reply-to" href="http://s.example.com/post47">Some Article</a>
 as <span class="p-category">tag</span>
</span>
</nowiki></pre>

Adding in an h-card makes it a [[person-tag]]. See [[person-tag]] for more specific examples.

<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-entry"> ... 
 Alice tagged 
 <a href="http://bob.example.com/" class="p-category h-card">Bob Smith</a> 
 in <a class="u-tag-of u-in-reply-to" href="http://s.example.com/post47">Some article</a> 
</span>
</nowiki></pre>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
Aaron Parecki links tags in his posts (specifically, [[hashtags]]) to tag aggregation pages, e.g.:
* http://aaronparecki.com/tag/indieweb
His tag aggregation pages include a list of the following, all date-time ordered together:
* all of his [[posts]] (of any kind) with that tag
* any comments with that tag made [[in-reply-to]] his posts
* any posts of others' with that tag that he replied to.

=== Kyle Mahan ===

{{kylewm}} has an old-fashioned list of tags at the end of each post. [[hashtags]] that are added inline automatically populate the tag list (so that they will appear twice, once inline, once in the list).

== Web Tagging Origins ==
The mid-2000s Web 2.0 trend popularized free form tagging not part of any formal taxonomy (referred to as a <dfn>folksonomy</dfn>), as well as the practice of people tagging (each) others' content in a shared location (AKA <dfn>social tagging</dfn>) that could surface aggregate trends. This trend was started in 2004 by various sites (link-tagging silo [[Delicious]] (original site since defunct) & photo silo [[Flickr]]), blogging tools (e.g. [[WordPress]]), and blog search engines ([[Technorati]] (2005 tag search now defunct)).

== Hashtags ==
{{main|hashtags}}
'''[[hashtags]]''' - a method of tagging [[posts]] merely by prefixing the literal text of the tag inline in the post content with hash or pound character '#'. Popularized on [[Twitter]], hashtags have been adopted on other silos as such as [[Instagram]], Google+, [[Tumblr]], [http://newsroom.fb.com/News/633/Public-Conversations-on-Facebook Facebook], etc.

== Person Tags ==
{{main|person-tag}}
[[person-tag]] - tagging a [[post]], often a [[photo]], as being about or of a person.

== Private Tags ==
Any kind of tag could also be made a private tag.

'''Private Tags''' -  a tag that is only visible to the content creator.
* Pinboard.in does this with special syntax: tags that start with a period. e.g., .secret_tag. See https://pinboard.in/tour/#privacy
* Private tags can be used to do [[POSSE]] stuff like what [https://www.facebook.com/selectivetwitter/info Selective Tweets] does with the #fb tag, but without having a visible public tag: like this IFTTT recipe that [https://ifttt.com/recipes/14872 crossposts Pinboard bookmarks to Twitter that have the .twitter private tag].
* I have a #readlater tag that I would love to have private -[[User:Www.sandeep.io|Www.sandeep.io]] 16:37, 11 September 2013 (PDT)

IndieWeb opinions:
* [[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]] uses a #private tag (as a way to reduce an interface element that is required less often) to make posts only visible to him. 
** You can combine Private tags and #private to make both tags and content visible only to the author.
