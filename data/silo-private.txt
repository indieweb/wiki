'''<dfn>silo-private</dfn>''' is the practice of turning all your [[silo]] profiles into [[private account]]s or to publish [[private post]]s by default to direct people to view and share links to your original indieweb posts instead of [[POSSE]] silo copies.

== Why ==
There are many reasons to go silo-private:
* encourage people to read your indieweb site instead
* encourage people to share links to your indieweb site instead of [[POSSE]] copies of your posts
* prevent [[likespam]] on your [[POSSE]] copies (e.g. on [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]], both of whom still show [[block]]ed likers on your posts, thus polluting your [[backfeed]] webmentions as well.)
* incremental step toward [[silo-quit]]ting

== How ==
See the following for instructions for going silo-private across various silos:
* [[private account]]
* [[privacy]]
