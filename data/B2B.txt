{{stub}}

'''<dfn>B2B</dfn>''' is an abbreviation of "business to business" and refers to commercial transactions between two businesses. Usually this forms part of a chain of commercial transactions that will ultimately terminate at a consumer. In software, we can think of the consumer as being the "end-user".

This is distinct from [[B2C]], [[B2G]] and a potentially limitless set of compound acronyms.
