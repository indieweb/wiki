'''<dfn>group</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb (also "indie group" or "indie groups") is a place where people can deliberately share content with each other, not necessarily on their own domain (though likely copied from via [[webmention]] etc.).

== Similar ==
=== Hashtags ===
[[Hashtags]] are similar in that they're a mechanism for deliberately sharing content with an explicit focus (group-like). 

==== incidental vs other place ====
However hashtags are not a "group" in that you're not going some other place to explicitly scope your post primarily to that place. With hashtags you're only incidentally (typically with merely adding a # to your existing text) associating your content with others.

==== your own publishing vs group sharing ====
Hashtags are about publishing your stuff first, and associating it with a set (like a group) second. Groups and posting to groups are about primarily about sharing with the group first (though if it's a public group, you may also be secondarily publishing what you share publicly).

==== unmoderated vs admin ====
Groups usually have "admins" of some sort (typically starting with whoever created the group) that have the ability to block, include, exclude, remove content. 

Hashtags are usually completely unmoderated - anyone can post "to" them.
