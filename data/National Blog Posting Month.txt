'''<dfn>[http://www.blogher.com/blogher-topics/blogging-social-media/nablopomo National Blog Posting Month]</dfn>''' (typically shortened '''NaBloPoMo''') is a challenge to write a daily blog post for an entire month. It was started in 2006 by Eden Kennedy "as kind of a joke because I'd failed at [[NaNoWriMo]] the previous year". [http://open.salon.com/blog/wqbelle/2011/01/23/nablopomo_national_blog_posting_month] In 2010, NaBloPoMo was sold to Blogher.com. Blogher has continued to run NaBloPoMo, expanding the challenge to every month of the year.
