'''<dfn>autosuggest</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>auto-suggest</dfn>) is a user-interface feature that provides a list of options while the user is typing, related to what the user has typed, possibly beyond mere (sub)string matches.

== Background ==
At IndieWebCamp [[2012]] a bunch of participants noted that there are several building blocks we need in order to advance the indieweb beyond just being a collection of hyperlinked independent websites. One of those is the notion of '''Indie autosuggest''', in particular, for typing/picking a person, e.g. using their name or alias (@-name or otherwise).

== Patterns ==
There are plenty of documented design patterns around the web for single line, static-content inputs (e.g. tag inputs, email To/CC/BCC), but hardly anything for multi-line, dynamic-content UIs where autosuggest is context-sensitive.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* none currently

== Silo Examples ==
Examples from [[silos]] on their websites:

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] on facebook.com in their search bar at the top has excellent autosuggestion of names of people you are connected to, pages you've "liked", and even people you *may* know (i.e. 2nd degree).

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] on Twitter.com in their Compose Tweet Box:
* Brings up suggestion UI on first character ''after'' @, no #tag autosuggest support
* Autosuggestion UI is a dropdown menu below the textarea
* Return accepts autosuggestion and appends a space, spacebar does nothing
* Backspace exits autosuggestion UI
* @name autosuggestion shows @name, full name and profile photo

=== Google+ ===
[[GooglePlus]]  on plus.google.com in the "share what's newâ€¦" box (if prefixed by @ or +), or bare in the to: or top search boxes will autosuggest, 
* first from your circled people,

* secondarily from other people with public profiles.

* finally from pages.

* It shows full name, photo and circle(s). 
* It does not show any unique ID (email or URL), leading to poor UX if someone has multiple gmail accounts.

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] in its app has autosuggest in its image description box for both users and hashtags:

== Platform Examples ==
Examples specific to a particular platform.

=== iOS Tweet Sheet ===
The iOS built in Tweet Sheet UI:
* Brings up suggestion UI on first character ''after'' @, no autosuggest for #tags
* Requires tap on UI to accept autosuggestion
* Backspace does not exit autosuggestion UI
* @name autosuggestion UI shows @name, full name, profile photo
* Photos: [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/m3 iPad] [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/m4 iPhone]
=== Twitter iOS app ===
The iOS Native Official Twitter App:
* Brings up autosuggest UI on @ or # character entry
* Requires tap on UI to accept autosuggestion
* Backspace exits autosuggestion UI
* @name autosuggestion shows @name, full name and profile photo
* Photos: [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/m2 iPad]

== Analysis ==
=== Lack of consistency ===
In conclusion, there is almost no consistency between UIs across platforms or even between platforms. 

=== Common aspects ===
Common denominators (add more as they emerge):
* @name autosuggestion shows @name, full name and profile photo

== Related sessions ==
At [[2012|IndieWebCamp 2012]]:
* [[2012/Sign_In_With_Your_Name|Sign In With Your Name]]
* [[2012/Open_Real_Time_Search_Engine|Open Real Time Search Engine]]
sessions both discussed indie autosuggest a lot, and resulted in some code demonstrated as part of the day 2:
* [[2012/Demos#Open_Follow|Open Follow]] hack ([https://github.com/evanp/openfollow code on github]).
