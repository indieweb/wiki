=About=
== What is the IndieWeb? ==
The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. 
{| class="wikitable" style="background-color:#F8FCF7; border: 1px #eaf6e8 solid; padding: 6px;" cellpadding="10"
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" |[[file:icon_4611.png|48px]]
| '''Your content is yours'''<br>When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and [[site-deaths|lost all of their users’ data]]. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.<br><br>
|-
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" |[[file:icon_31635.png|48px]]
| '''You are better connected'''<br>Your articles and status messages can [[POSSE|go to all services]], not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Even replies and likes on other services can [[backfeed|come back to your site]] so they’re all in one place.<br><br>
|-
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" background-color: #f9f9f9; |[[file:icon_2003.png|48px]]
|'''You are in control'''<br>You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as ''example.com/ideas''. These links are [[permalinks|permanent]] and will always work.<br><br>
|}

== Beyond Blogging and Decentralization ==
The IndieWeb effort is [[different]] from previous efforts/communities:
* '''[[Principles]]''' over project-centrism. Others assume a [[monoculture]] of one project for all. We are developing a [[principles#Plurality|plurality of projects]].
* '''[[Selfdogfood]]''' instead of email. Show before tell. Prioritize by scratching your own itches, [[creator|creating]], iterating on your own site.
* '''[[Design]]''' first, formats second. Focus on good UX & selfdogfood prototypes to create minimum necessary formats &amp; protocols.


== Homebrew Website Club ==
<div style="float:right">[[events/2014-05-21-homebrew-website-club|<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoN7z1SIcAAa2Us.jpg" width="250px"/>]]<div style="white-space:nowrap">Homebrew Website Club [[events/2014-05-21-homebrew-website-club|2014-05-21]]</div></div>
'''<dfn>Homebrew Website Club</dfn>''' is a biweekly meetup of people passionate about or interested in creating, improving, building, designing their own website, in the same structure as the Homebrew Computer Club meetings. [http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter]

We meet every other Wednesday<abbr title="skipping any official US Holidays">*</abbr> right after work, 18:30-19:30, across cities and [[IRC|online]].
