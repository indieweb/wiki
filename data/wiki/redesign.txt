At IndieWebCamp 2014 we had a session to [[2014/fix-the-indiewebcamp-wiki|redesign the wiki]]. The new theme is currently installed on the wiki, but not set to be the default theme yet. 

== Preview the New Theme ==
* [http://indiewebcamp.com/?useskin=teahouse preview the new theme].
* Set your default theme to "Teahouse" in your [[Special:Preferences|user preferences]]

== Contribute to the Redesign ==
If you want to suggest new CSS edits for the wiki, you can send a pull request to the Mediawiki skin here: https://github.com/indieweb/wiki

If you are signed in to the wiki, there is an additional style tag added on the page:

<pre>http://example.com/indiewebcamp.css</pre>

(where example.com is actually your website)

This gives you a way to make CSS edits to test things out on the real wiki with the full content rather than setting up your own MediaWiki install.

== Issues ==
* Events and "What is indie" on every page... I only need this on the home page--<span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14055807513_dea2b533b6_s.jpg}}[[User:Bret.io|Bret Comnes]]</span> 16:14, 21 July 2014 (PDT)
* Wiki tools should be an edit button, with the other tools a drop down.  Similar to getting started menu. --<span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14055807513_dea2b533b6_s.jpg}}[[User:Bret.io|Bret Comnes]]</span> 16:14, 21 July 2014 (PDT)
* navbar doesn't fold up properly at smaller sizes.<br>[[File:responsive-navbar-firefox-2014-07-21.png|none|thumbnail|pills drop below the bar at medium width]]<br>[[File:responsive-navbar-firefox-smaller-2014-07-21.png|none|thumbnail|disappear altogether on a phone]]
* line-height of textareas is very narrow (prefer ~1.4em) [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]
* no border around thumbnails
* Code boxes are hard to read/identify due to lack of boarder or background.
* Summarizing tantek:
** Wiki tools usage
*** very frequent / daily: Page, Edit, History
*** "Page" link is the *fastest* (muscle memory) way to go from a "Edit" state or "History" state to the current state of the page
*** do wish we had keyboard shortcuts working
*** rarely (once a month?) Delete, Move
*** never: Discussion, Protect, Unwatch, Log out
* {{gRegor}}: The section "edit" links are proportionally sized. Should be the same size regardless of heading size.

== Todo ==

* Collapse TOC on pages
* Testing on current site with plugins
* Clean up timestamps in event feed
* Remove orange underline from linked images
* Fix preference navigation tabs
