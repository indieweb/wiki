The Knight News Challenge is promoting the open web. Several IndieWeb folks have submitted projects in the latest call for grant proposals, entitled "[https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/brief.html How can we strengthen the Internet for free expression and innovation?]" 

It's helpful to "applaud" and and comment on these, if you're moved to do so.
