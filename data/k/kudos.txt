'''<dfn>Kudos</dfn>''' comes from Ancient Greek and means ‘fame’, and is as such used as general praise on the internet, predating the [[like]] button; [[Strava]] uses it as equivalent of a like.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Strava ===

Strava uses Kudos as an equivalent of [[like]]. The UI involves a thumbs-up icons that is marked red once clicked. The only difference is that they can't be undone. Once the thumbs-up icon is red, it opens a modal that shows all kudos and [[comments]].
