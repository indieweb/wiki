'''<dfn>[http://ownyourgram.com OwnYourGram.com]</dfn>''' is a service which streams your [[Instagram]] [[photo]]s to your own site in real-time. After signing in with [[IndieAuth]], it sends your Instagram photos to your [[micropub]] endpoint.

== Features ==
=== Person Tagging ===
OwnYourGram detects when an Instagram photo has [[person-tag]]s, and then passes those along in the Micropub request!

Implemented [https://github.com/aaronpk/OwnYourGram/commit/b688b521755438dbf1755273f5e157ff7d115681 2015-07-16] (requested [https://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?title=OwnYourGram&action=historysubmit&diff=20661&oldid=9295 2015-07-14][http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-07-14#t1436900516486]!)

How:
* Detects IG @-username person-tags on a photo
* Translates those to personal site URLs from the person's Instagram profile
** If there is no such personal site URL, it sends the URL of the person's Instagram profile

This feature helps turn [[Instagram]] into an IndieWeb client capable of supporting Player A's client needs in [[SWAT0]].[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-07-14#t1436900498172]
