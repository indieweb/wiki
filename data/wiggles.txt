'''<dfn>Wiggles</dfn>''' (also known as ''3D shakes'', ''3D photos/images'' or ''jittergrams'') are a type of [[photo]]/[[video]] [[post]] consisting of animated photos consisting of typically two (sometimes more) alternating frames taken from slightly different viewpoints, giving the impression of a 3D photo when animated.

They utilise [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiggle_stereoscopy Wiggle Stereoscopy], from which they take their name.

== How to create wiggles ==

The free [http://www.jittergramapp.com/ Jittergram]] app for iOS makes it easy to quickly create wiggles, with the option of exporting them as regular 3D photos requiring 3D glasses.

It should be fairly easy to create wiggles with any camera and application which makes animated GIFs.
