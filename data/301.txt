'''<dfn>301</dfn>''' ('''301 Moved Permanently''') is an [[HTTP]] status code returned from a web server to indicate the URL is permanently [[redirect|redirected]] to another URL.

In general, a [[redirect]] is a way to send both users and search engines to a different URL from the one they originally requested. The three most commonly used redirects are [[301]], [[302]], and Meta Refresh. These are frequently used/needed when changing [[CMS]]es and potentially the structure of one's [[permalinks]] to get the old URLs to redirect to the new ones.

Here's a useful gist for creating 301 redirects within an .[[htaccess]] file for sites using [[Apache]] : https://gist.github.com/ScottPhillips/1721489
