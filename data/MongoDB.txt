IndieWeb community members using MongoDB for storage with their projects:

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}}'s [http://werd.io/ werd.io] runs [[Known]] with [[MongoDB]] since 2013-05 (werd.io launch, just before [[2013|IndieWebCamp 2013]]).

=== Michael Owens ===
{{mko}} uses [[Indie.js]] on [https://mowens.com mowens.com] which has used MongoDB for its data store since July 2014.
