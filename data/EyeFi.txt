'''Eye-Fi''' is a brand of SD card that contains a built-in Wi-Fi radio which can be used to quickly transfer images from a digital camera to a computer or mobile device (iOS/Android).

It'd be pretty neat to be able to post photos to your own site (and possibly also [[POSSE]] them out to photo silos like [[Flickr]] and [[Instagram]]) from a mobile device using EyeFi.
