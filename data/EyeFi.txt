'''Eye-Fi''' is a brand of SD card that contains a built-in Wi-Fi radio which can be used to quickly transfer images from a digital camera to a computer or mobile device (iOS/Android).

It'd be pretty neat to be able to post photos to your own site (and possibly also [[POSSE]] them out to photo silos like [[Flickr]] and [[Instagram]]) from a mobile device using EyeFi.

* [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]]: my use case is this - back on 2014-03-29, I posted this https://tommorris.org/posts/8872 - I would have liked to have taken it with my decent camera (X-Pro1), then posted it to my own site from my phone, with the photo hosted on my own (sub)domain.
