'''<dfn>Swarm</dfn>''' is an app by [[Foursquare]] focused on [[checkins]] and showing nearby friends. 

== Advertising use of friends photos ==
2015-03-25 {{kevinmarks}} was [https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/580959376321572864 shown an advertisement] in his Swarm app: 
<img style="max-width:100%" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CA_7eErUgAAE5wo.jpg:large" alt="CVS advertisement screenshot of Swarm app with icon of a friend in affiliation due to checkin"/>
Note the first icon which is {{t}}'s icon on [[Foursquare]] (and thus Swarm), likely due to him having checked into CVS: "have been here".


==[[PESOS]]==
Checking in using Swarm, via their app, is easy but getting your content out is a little trickier. They do offer standard "share" options but nothing automatic.

[[User:Davidjohnmead.com]] uses an [[IFTTT]] recipe for [[WordPress]] to watch his [[Swarm]] checkins, using the [[Foursquare]] channel. When a new entry appears it creates a post on his [http://davidjohnmead.com/blog blog].

You can find his recipe at https://ifttt.com/recipes/365678-post-swarm-check-in-s-to-your-wordpress-blog.

As Swarm is only an app (no website to log in to), the link back is to the location (VenueURL) on Foursquare's site.
