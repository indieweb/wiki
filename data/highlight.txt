A '''<dfn>highlight</dfn>''' is a [[reaction]] post of a range of content that consists typically of just a restyling (like a yellow background as you might use a yellow physical highlighter, or an underline).

== Why ==
People highlight books and other physical texts, as well as do so with revisions in proprietary software like Microsoft Word, thus there is some evidence they may want to do so with [[posts]] on the web as well.

== How To ==
No specific how to post a highlight post has been determined. More real world examples are needed for study before reasoned proposals can be made / implemented that would be able to support a desired presentation.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
None so far, though [[Medium]] may have features resembling highlighting.

Needs more research, documentation, screenshots.

== Brainstorming ==
=== bookmark a fragmention ===
At a minimum, a highlight post could be represented by a [[bookmark]] of a [[fragmention]]. 

The receiver of the highlight reaction, could determine this automatically, and decide to provide highlighting with a default highlight color that goes well with their post styling.

Alternatively, since highlights of paper text typical consist of the person doing the highlighting making a deliberate choice of <em>how</em> to stylistically express the highlighting, that stylistic expression could be considered as an additional attribute / property of a highlight post.
