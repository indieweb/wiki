A '''<dfn>webring</dfn>''' is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure.

== Why ==
The point of a webring is to create a virtuous cycle of recommendations between web authors.  

One author sends the 'ring' traffic and expose the ideas that they think are interesting in a way that is more seamless than a "you should read this [link]", and hopefully if that stuff is interesting the other author(s) will reciprocate.

== History ==

WebRing was originally created by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_Weil Sage Weil] in 1994, who then sold it in 1997, and then promptly founded [[DreamHost]], a popular web hosting company.

* [http://ben.thatmustbe.us http://ben.thatmustbe.us] redirects to a different website representing someone named Ben every time the domain is reloaded. (Technically a centrally controlled webring of sorts)
* https://webring.xxiivv.com/ - an attempt to inspire artists & developers to build their own website and share traffic among each other. The ring welcomes personalized websites such as diaries, [[wiki|wikis]] & [[portfolio|portfilios]]. [https://github.com/XXIIVV/webring Code available on Github].

* [https://weirdwidewebring.net/ Weird Wide Webring] - Your site must be unique and weird in some way. It can be the way it looks. It can be the way you write or what you write about. It can be the way it smells. It can be the way your footer is covered in feet, your sidebar has a sidebartender, or blog is spelled "blag". But there must be something.

== Tools ==

* [https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring openring] a tool for generating a webring from [[RSS]] feeds for [[static site generator]]s, so you can link to other blogs you like on your own blog. Also functions very much like a [[related reading]] tool/presentation. (Example from the wild: https://drewdevault.com/2021/07/04/Is-GitHub-a-derivative-work.html)
