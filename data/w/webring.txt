A '''<dfn>webring</dfn>''' is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure.

== Why ==
The point of a webring is to create a virtuous cycle of recommendations between web authors.  

One author sends the 'ring' traffic and expose the ideas that they think are interesting in a way that is more seamless than a "you should read this [link]", and hopefully if that stuff is interesting the other author(s) will reciprocate.

== History ==

WebRing was originally created by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_Weil Sage Weil] in 1994, who then sold it in 1997, and then promptly founded [[DreamHost]], a popular web hosting company.
