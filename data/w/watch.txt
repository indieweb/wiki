{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>watch</dfn>''' is a semi-[[passive post|passive]] type of [[post]] used to publish that you have watched a video â€” typically movie, TV show, or other video recordings.

== Why ==
Posting a "watch" post, distinct from a "[[note]]", or at least distinguishable from a plain note, could provide a [[reader]] with sufficient context to lookup and display additional information about the show that was watched, perhaps even an option for the viewer to watch as well, online or from a local library.

Distinguishing watch posts may also help readers either filter-in or filter-out watch posts, for aggregation and/or search use-cases.

== How ==
=== How to publish ===
There is no agreed convention for posting "watch" posts. See the examples below and [[#Brainstorming]] for ideas on how to post "watch" posts.
 
== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} keeps track of movies and television he's watched, wants to watch, liked, were ok, did not like, etc. on his personal site snarfed.org:
* https://snarfed.org/movies 
* https://snarfed.org/tv

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has checked into shows manually in the past. When [[Shazam]] allows easier identification, he uses that as part of his workflow, particularly because it aids in the identification of the episode details.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has posted [[notes]] while watching things, without thinking of them as [[watch]] posts at the time.

After recent [https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-05#t1475703662093000 discussion] I am thinking about it more and experimenting with intentional watch posts. It's still a note, it just starts with "Watched":

As of 2017-03-30, I'm trying out "want to watch" posts:

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} actively checks into shows using [[watch]] posts on his site. He is thinking through possible way to markup with prototype [[microformats]].
* Checkins appear in [http://eddiehinkle.com/social/ his social stream]
* Checkins have [http://eddiehinkle.com/watch/ their own stream]
* He posts [http://eddiehinkle.com/watch/2017/03/the-flash-s3-e17-interested/ wants to watch] posts and [http://eddiehinkle.com/watch/2017/03/this-is-us-s1-e18-finished/ has watched] posts and occasionally syndicates them to Twitter.

=== Grant Richmond ===
{{grantcodes}} uses a [[node.js]] script to automatically import watched movies and tv from [[trakt.tv]] via [[micropub]]

* Watch posts appear at [https://grant.codes/watched grant.codes/watched]
* [https://github.com/grantcodes/trakt-to-micropub Source code for importer on GitHub]

=== Proto examples ===
==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has a wiki page that happens to have [http://tantek.com/w/WatchFilms#Favoritemoviesyoushouldsee films] / [http://tantek.com/w/WatchFilms#FavoriteTVshowsyoushouldwatch TV shows] that he has watched that he recommends.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Netflix ===
[[Netflix]] keeps a list of everything you've watched with timestamps.

=== IMDb ===
IMDb is apparently supporting a beta (marked as such on 10/7/16, and possibly before) [http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?checkins checkin functionality] though it doesn't have a permalink structure available for [[POSSE]] or [[PESOS]]. It does apparently provide an RSS feed for checkins however, so data could be extracted by that avenue.

=== tvtag ===
[[tvtag]] (aka getglue) enabled checkins for TV and movies. Site is now defunct and redirects (apparently via an ad?) to Telfie.

=== Telfie ===
[https://telfie.com Telfie] allows checkins for TV and movies, but doesn't provide permalinks for individual checkins. It also doesn't have any feeds out or the ability to import/export any data as of 2018-01-31.

=== Trakt.tv ===
[https://trakt.tv/ Trakt.tv] has an API that allows checkins for TV and movies, integrated into many apps across web browser extensions and various mobile platforms. They also use the verb [[scrobble]] to indicate what one is watching on a variety of platforms.

=== Letterboxd ===
[https://letterboxd.com/ Letterboxd] is a silo focused on your film library and movies you've watched. It supports creating lists, following others, and logging when films were watched. Import of data from IMDB is also possible.

=== Miso TV ===
Miso TV is a former silo that allowed checkin for TV


== Brainstorming ==
Similarly there could be "to watch" posts. E.g. Netflix has a queue where you can put things you want to watch. 

IMDB.com supports a "watchlist" (akin to a [[bookmark]] and they actually use a bookmark logo) with a public/private toggle that also includes an export feature. They also have lists, reviews, and ratings for a more thorough workflow. 

Shazam is occasionally able to listen to a TV show or movie (typically popular networks/top 100 shows) and identify it and then allow one to share the "checkin" to other social networks via mobile. Unfortunately it's not always very reliable.

=== Emoji for checkins and syndication ===
Similar to [[read]]ing, one could use emojis to add some context, particularly for syndicating to Twitter:
* ðŸ“º Television (from broadcast or cable?)
* ðŸ“¡ Satellite TV
* ðŸ“€ DVD
* ðŸ“¼ videocassette
* ðŸŽž Film Frames
* ðŸŽ« Ticket (for checking into a physical theater, or music concert/other event)
* ðŸŽŸ Admission Tickets (similar to Ticket above)
Other possibilities:
* ðŸ“½ Film Projector
Other possibilities that are more like recordings:
* ðŸŽ¥ Movie camera
* ðŸŽ¬ Clapper board
