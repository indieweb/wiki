A '''<dfn>watch</dfn>''' is a semi-[[passive post|passive]] type of [[post]] used to publish that you have watched a video (movie, TV, film), or a live show (theater, concert).

== Why ==
Posting a "watch" post, distinct from a "[[note]]", or at least distinguishable from a plain note, could provide a [[reader]] with sufficient context 
{{emojicon|▶️}}{{emojicon|🎬}} 
to lookup and display additional information about the show that was watched, perhaps even an option for the viewer to watch as well, online or from a local library.

Distinguishing watch posts may also help readers either filter-in or filter-out watch posts, for aggregation and/or search use-cases.

== How ==
=== How to publish ===
There is no explicitly agreed syntax or format for posting "watch" posts. However, conventions are emerging as can be seen from the examples:
__TOC__
Post a [[note]] with the following:
# an emoji or icon to indicate the (sub)type of watching like:
#* 📺 TV or episode of a series
#* 🎬 movie
#* 🎫 live concert, scheduled movie or theater show where you purchased a ticket for admission
#* ▶/▶️ internet video ([[Netflix]] movie, [[YouTube]] video), something watched on a computer (laptop and/or desktop, possibly with a projector)
# the text " watched "
# the name of the tv series or movie, and if series, followed by episode/season numbers and name of the episode if any
# a perma(short)link for the tv episode or movie itself, perhaps on a service like [[Shazam]] or canonical [[Wikipedia]] link
# optional review or commentary

See the examples below and [[#Brainstorming]] for more ideas on how to post "watch" posts, and feel free to diverge from the above (experiment!) per your own preferences, and especially if you have an explicit good reason that you can document in your own indieweb example section below!

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has checked into shows manually in the past. When [[Shazam]] allows easier identification, he uses that as part of his workflow, particularly because it aids in the identification of the episode details. Since 2016-05-06:
* TV episode: http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/watching-empire-s2-e16-the-lyon-who-cried-wolf
** syntax: text "Watching ", name of series, ": ", season n & episode m in "Sn | Em " format, quoted name of episode, [[Shazam]] permashortlink for that specific episode
* [http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/-watching-empire-s3-e3-what-remains-is-bestial-rgan_sharetitletitlett5668610 http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/-watching-empire-s3-e3-what-remains-is-bestial-rgan_sharetitletitlett5668610]

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has posted [[notes]] while watching things, without thinking of them as [[watch]] posts at the time.

* https://gregorlove.com/2014/11/currently-watching-on-repeat-http-spazzdhn-1/

After recent [https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-05#t1475703662093000 discussion] I am thinking about it more and experimenting with intentional watch posts. It's still a note, it just starts with "Watched":
* https://gregorlove.com/2016/10/watched-breaking-a-monster/

As of 2017-03-30, I'm trying out "want to watch" posts:

* Full list of watches appears at [https://doubleloop.net/kind/watch doubleloop.net/kind/watch].
Details:
* Starts with a play ▶ icon and the word “Watched”
* Often he adds a brief comment about or quote from the video, which is usually a short description/review/reflection.
* YouTube links are auto-embedded

=== Charlotte Allen ===
{{Charlotte Allen}} PESOSs her Trakt account to her site using [https://charlotteallen.info/2020/01/08/lets-pesos-passive-posts-with-trakt-and-last-fm/ Zapier and Trakt's RSS feed].

=== Related watch list examples ===
Related to "watch" posts, but not quite watch posts themselves, a few folks keep lists of shows that have been watched, sometimes with annotations about whether they liked them or not.

==== Ryan Barrett ====
{{snarfed}} keeps track of movies and television he's watched and wants to watch, including ratings, on his personal site snarfed.org:
* https://snarfed.org/movies 
* https://snarfed.org/tv

==== Tantek lists ====
{{t}} has a wiki page that happens to have [http://tantek.com/w/WatchFilms#Favoritemoviesyoushouldsee films] / [http://tantek.com/w/WatchFilms#FavoriteTVshowsyoushouldwatch TV shows] that he has watched that he recommends.
* http://tantek.com/w/WatchFilms

== Silo Examples ==
=== Netflix ===
[[Netflix]] keeps a list of everything you've watched with timestamps.

=== IMDb ===
[[IMDb]] is apparently supporting a beta (marked as such on 10/7/16, and possibly before) [http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?checkins checkin functionality] though it doesn't have a permalink structure available for [[POSSE]] or [[PESOS]]. It does apparently provide an RSS feed for checkins however, so data could be extracted by that avenue.

=== tvtag ===
[[tvtag]] (aka getglue) enabled checkins for TV and movies. Site is now defunct and redirects (apparently via an ad?) to Telfie.

=== Telfie ===
[https://telfie.com Telfie] allows checkins for TV and movies, but doesn't provide permalinks for individual checkins. It also doesn't have any feeds out or the ability to import/export any data as of 2018-01-31.

=== Trakt.tv ===
[https://trakt.tv/ Trakt.tv] has an API that allows checkins for TV and movies, integrated into many apps across web browser extensions and various mobile platforms. They also use the verb [[scrobble]] to indicate what one is watching on a variety of platforms.

=== Letterboxd ===
[[Letterboxd]] is a silo focused on your film library and movies you've watched. It supports creating lists, following others, and logging when films were watched. Import of data from IMDB is also possible.

=== Miso TV ===
Miso TV is a former silo that allowed checkin for TV

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] allows people to post watches and includes [[facepile|facepiles]] of friends who have watched/liked that particular series in the past.

https://indieweb.org/images/9/91/Facebook_Watch.PNG

== Brainstorming ==
=== additional how-to ===
Add duration, publisher, host, hashtags, quotes to your "watch" posts!

In addition to the [[#How_to_publish]] guidance of:
* emoji/icon (e.g. ▶), "watched ", name of video, [[video]] post permalink, review/commentary
Consider an extended version with more options like:
* emoji/icon (e.g. ▶), "watched ", name of video, (duration), [[video]] post permalink, published by @-name, hosted by @-name, review/commentary/hashtags/quotes

E.g.:
* https://tantek.com/2020/116/t1/arundhati-roy-pandemic-portal

=== to watch ===
Similarly there could be "to watch" posts. E.g. Netflix has a queue where you can put things you want to watch. See also details at [[want]].

IMDB.com supports a "watchlist" (akin to a [[bookmark]] and they actually use a bookmark logo) with a public/private toggle that also includes an export feature. They also have lists, reviews, and ratings for a more thorough workflow. 

[[Letterboxd]] also has watchlist functionality that is sortable by date added, service, genre, decade, and watch status.

=== Shazam PESOS ===
[[Shazam]] is occasionally able to listen to a TV show or movie (typically popular networks/top 100 shows) and identify it and then allow one to share the "checkin" to other social networks via mobile. Unfortunately it's not always very reliable.

=== u-watch-of ===
Several individuals use an experimental property, [https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/17 u-watch-of], to indicate that the url is either a video page, or an informational page on video content. Similar to u-like-of, the goal of the property was to allow the site receiving a webmention with such a page to note # of views (like video silos do), or perhaps display a [[facepile]] of people who watched it.

=== Emoji for checkins and syndication ===
Similar to [[read]]ing, one could use emojis to add some context, particularly for syndicating to Twitter:
* ▶ or ▶️ internet video ([[Netflix]] movie, [[YouTube]] video)
* 📺 Television (from broadcast or cable?)
* 📡 Satellite TV
* 📀 DVD/Laserdisc
* 📼 videocassette
* 🎞 Film Frames
* 🎫 Ticket (for checking into a physical theater, or music concert/other event)
* 🎟 Admission Tickets (similar to Ticket above)
Other possibilities:
* 📽 Film Projector
Other possibilities that are more like recordings:
* 🎥 Movie camera
* 🎬 Clapper board

Previously:
* 💻 personal computer (e.g. [[Netflix]] or a native app for viewing video)
** I proposed and used this, however having second thoughts about using the laptop emoji for things watched on the internet (Netflix movies, YouTube videos etc.) because the laptop emoji could really mean so many other things. Now preferring the ▶ or ▶️ emoji instead. — {{t}}
