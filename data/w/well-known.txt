{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Well-known</dfn>''' refers to designating a common URL on domains for data to be located typically automatically by some software (like a browser or a search engine), and is generally an [[antipattern]] to be avoided, because it breaks the portability of content across directories and systems; see [[follow your nose]] instead.

"Well-known" are prescribed URLs/paths, whereas there are also ''emergent'' common [[page]] URLs published by IndieWeb sites like [[about]], [[contact]], etc. See:
* [[page]]

There are a couple of common <span id="Examples">patterns</span> or categories of "well-known" URLs:
# a root level file
# stuff inside a root level "/[[.well-known]]/" directory, standardized by https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615

== Root Level ==

=== emergent pages ===
There are a small handful of emergent (semi-uncoordinated) root level pages that some community members have published:
* [[about]]
* [[contact]]
* [[now]]
* ...

See those individual pages for specific IndieWeb Examples etc.

There is also a search engine that is indexing specifically a few of these pages:
* https://aboutideasnow.com/about — indexes /about /now /ideas

=== historical for browsers and bots ===
Historically there are several root level paths that are used by browser and search engines, and it's unlikely that we’ll ever be rid of them:
* [https://www.robotstxt.org/ robots.txt]
* favicon.ico

=== something.txt ===
There has been a disturbing pattern of new proposals in form of <samp>something.txt</samp> over the years:

Apparently these root files are a convention on some sites:
