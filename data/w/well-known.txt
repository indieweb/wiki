'''<dfn>Well-known</dfn>''' refers to designating a common URL on domains for data to be located typically automatically by some software (like a browser or a search engine), and is generally an [[antipattern]] to be avoided, because it breaks the portability of content across directories and systems.

"Well-known" are prescribed URLs/paths, whereas there are also ''emergent'' common [[page]] URLs published by IndieWeb sites like [[about]], [[contact]], etc. See:
* [[page]]

There are a couple of common <span id="Examples">patterns</span> or categories of "well-known" URLs:
# a root level file
# stuff inside a root level "/[[.well-known]]/" directory, standardized by https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615

== Root Level ==
Historically there are several root level paths that are used by browser and search engines, and it's unlikely that weâ€™ll ever be rid of them:
* [https://www.robotstxt.org/ robots.txt]
* favicon.ico

However there has been a disturbing pattern of new proposals in form of <samp>something.txt</samp> over the years:
=== something.txt ===
(if this list gets too big, create a separate page)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ads.txt ads.txt]
** Criticism: 2019-05-10 [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/adstxt-zero-day-exploit-wild-brief-history-fraud-ad-fraud-historian/ How Ads.txt is Being Exploited by "Baddies" for Fun and Profit]
* [https://humanstxt.org/ humans.txt]
* [https://securitytxt.org/ security.txt]
* 2020 [https://journallist.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/trust.txt-specification-v-1-1.pdf trust.txt]

=== API endpoints ===
Apparently these root files are a convention on some sites:
* <samp> /code.json </samp>
* <samp> /data.json </samp>
Per:
* https://twitter.com/mistersql/status/1528833918245511171 (also yet another mislabeling of 'microformats' for something they are not)
** "did you know many gov't sites have a code.json or data.json at the root of their domain to let you discover the opensource and open data they have available?<br><br>https://www.dol.gov/code.json<br>https://www.dol.gov/data.json<br><br>I haven't found if there are any more of these microformats" [https://supportkind.org/about/ @mistersql] May 23, 2022
