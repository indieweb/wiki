{{stub}}

'''<dfn>webcal</dfn>''' is a URL scheme for accessing calendar information (typically via an [[iCalendar]] feed over [[HTTP]]).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{t}} has on his home page tantek.com a "webcal:" link to his recent/upcoming events (using the dev.h2vx.com service) since sometime in the mid-2000s when X2V was first developed and deployed.

== Client Support ==
=== iOS Safari ===
* Mobile Safari on iOS 10 appears to support "webcal:" links and when activated presents the user with a dialog like:

 "Subscribe to the Calendar “calendarname”?" 
      [ Subscribe ] [ Cancel ]

If you choose Subscribe, the dialog changes to
 "The Calendar “calendarname” has been added"
      [ View Events ] [ Done ]

If you choose View Events, the Calendar app opens to show you events in a list view with the events from the calendar you just subscribed to.

* [[event]]
* [[events-stream]]
