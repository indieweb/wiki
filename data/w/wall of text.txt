'''<dfn>wall of text</dfn>''' is an [[antipattern]] when a page contains almost exclusively text with little or no visual components, usually making the page feel overwhelming to engage with since it appears to require reading the entire thing. In a text-only environment, "wall of text" can also refer to a large section of text with no paragraph breaks or other punctuation.
