{{stub}}

'''<dfn>whisper tag</dfn>''' is text added to the footer of a post alongside traditional [[tag]]s that is meant to be read as a form of creative writing expression connected to the post rather than as a tool for organization.

This has the feel of a low stakes [[comment]] with the real world functionality of the idea of ''sotto voce''.
