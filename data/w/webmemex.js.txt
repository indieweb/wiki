'''<dfn>webmemex.js</dfn>''' is a script that creates two web components you can use for showing cards that represent incoming links (via Webmention) and outgoing links on a web page.

== How it Works ==

webmemex.js creates two web components that you can include on a web page:

* <code><incoming-links></incoming-links></code>: List all of the webmentions you have received. This code works with a webmention.io endpoint (or any other webmention endpoint that returns data in the same format).
* <code><outgoing-links></outgoing-links></code>: Show information cards about all of the outgoing links on a web page.
