'''<dfn>who to follow</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>people to follow</dfn> or <dfn>recommended users</dfn>) is a feature on a site that suggests people or other accounts to [[follow]], likely using a [[recommendation engine]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

Prior independent examples of an early but limited type of this functionality can be seen in the early use of [[blogroll|blogrolls]]. For some ideas and prior artwork, see also [[blogroll#Brainstorming]].

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] shows (in a sidebar) a "PEOPLE TO FOLLOW" box with face, name, job title / org, number of friends that are following, and a "Follow" button, e.g. (both {{aaronpk}} and {{t}} have seen this particular recommendation when using FB):

=== Twitter ===
==== in Twitter profile sidebar ====
[[Twitter]] shows a "Who to follow" box in the sidebar when logged in and viewing someone else's profile. E.g.

If you click the "View all" link it goes to a whole page of follow suggestions:

Here's a screenshot of {{kartikprabhu}}'s "Who to follow" page on Twitter. Note Twitter shows only specified full names in the "Followed by ..." text. This can look interesting when users change their display name for various reasons, e.g. the "⚡️" that is a reference to David Bowie.
