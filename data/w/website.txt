A '''<dfn>website</dfn>''' is a collection of related web [[page|pages]], [[posts]], and content, typically identified with a common [[personal-domain|domain name]], and published on at least one [[web_hosting|web server or host]].

In an IndieWeb world, everyone has their own personal website instead of relying on centralized [[silos]]. The goal of the pages on this wiki are dedicated to helping [[people]] create, maintain, better understand, and better use their own personal websites to interact and communicate on the web. 

Sites can also be built and maintained by third party companies or built from scratch depending on a person's needs, desires, and experience. Sites can be created from things as simple as raw handwritten [[HTML]] and sometimes using [[CSS]] all the way up to more complicated [[static_site|static generated sites]] or built using [[content management system|content management systems]] dynamically and written in a wide variety of programming languages.
