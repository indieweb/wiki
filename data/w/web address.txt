A '''<dfn>web address</dfn>''' is a more friendly and understandable way to refer to a [[domain name]] and what is preferred both in the [[Web sign-in]] user experience, and in New York Times articles about domain names, and may sometimes be called a <dfn>DNS handle</dfn>, <dfn>domain handle</dfn>, or <dfn>internet handle</dfn>.

=== criticism of handle term ===
The term "handle" when used to mean an "address" or "alias" of some kind, is online-culture [[jargon]] and not readily obvious to typical online users.

No one in practice says "email handle" for example, they say "email address".

It's a a bit of a metaphorical stretch to explain a "handle" is something you "hold onto" or "pull on" to open a door (presumably to an online service or the internet) or worse to "hold onto" someone else. People don't have handles except in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_handles a derogatory sense].

Saying "internet address" instead of "internet handle" also doesn't work for this use-case because early on, "internet address" was an alias for "email address".
