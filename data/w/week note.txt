{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>week note</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>weekly notes</dfn>, <dfn>weekly summary</dfn>, <dfn> weekly roundup</dfn>, or <dfn>week in review</dfn>) is a post (usually a [[note]]) published at the end of the week that summarizes that week‚Äôs goals, accomplishments, events, posts, or other week-specific content the author wishes to share, similar to a [[monthly recap]], yet for a week, and typically manually written.

== Why ==
* Weeknotes are a good way to reflect on what you have accomplished in the last week
* In the future you can look back and see a summary of what happened that week
* Over time you can see how much you have done week to week
* You can see how you have evolved over time while reflecting on old notes

== How to ==
=== How to post ===
The most common way to share weeknotes is to write a blog post sharing your notes on what happened in your life in the previous week. Many weeknotes use bullet points to communicate notes as opposed to long-form prose, although there are community members that write long-form content in their weeknotes.

== Weeknote Prompts ==

Here are a few things you could talk about in your weeknotes:

* What you did with your personal website
* What you learned
* What media (books, TV shows, movies, etc.) you consumed
* Where you travelled
* What you ate
* How your work went
* Something interesting that happened to you

You can share as little or as much as you want in a weeknote. Weeknotes do not have to include personal information.
