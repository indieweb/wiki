'''<dfn>Welcoming</dfn>''' is how we as a community welcome new members to our community.

Most often people join on [[IRC]] (it's prominently suggested here).

== before events ==
People often find the community through one of our [[Homebrew Website Club]] or [[IndieWebCamp]] events.

Before such events, it may be helpful to message those who are going, encouraging them to join the chat/[[Slack]], introduce themselves, and suggest filling out the event wiki page with more info about themselves, their [[projects]], etc.

== indiewebcamp-vis ==
When someone joins the IRC channel as "indiewebcamp-vis" - it means they followed the web client link on the [[IRC]] wiki page. They might need some help engaging in the channel. Start with:

* '''Welcome indiewebcamp-vis! Go ahead and use the /nick command to change your name. e.g. /nick yournamehere'''

And then when they've done so, e.g. identified themselves as "Maheen", see the next section:

== new person ==
When a new person, say, "Maheen", joins #indiewebcamp, here are some things you can say and ask to make them feel welcome and help get them on board and taking steps towards being on the indieweb.

* '''Welcome Maheen!'''
* '''Do you have a website already?'''
* '''What's the next thing you want to do with or add to your personal site?'''
** The point of this question is start getting the new person thinking in terms of:
*** scratching your own itches
*** [[selfdogfooding]]
*** [[wikifying]] - adding such personal site itches to their "User:" page on the wiki

== Redirect Hypothetical Discussions ==
Off-topic, hypothetical, or rambling discussions tend to drive out more useful, practical, actionable conversation (and people!) in the channel, thus we must proactively respond and redirect such discussions to more productive ends.

If a new person, say, Alejandro, joins #indiewebcamp and starts discussing (i.e. rambling about) some random subject X (e.g. previously undocumented/unmentioned on/in indiewebcamp), it can be unproductive for everyone, both existing active IRC users, and new/quiet folks looking to learn immediately practical things about the indieweb.

Your goal as an experienced #indiewebcamp participant and overall [[positive community]] contributor is to redirect Alejandro's enthusiasm from any/all hypothetical/rambling discussions of subject X to:
* '''Practical''' indieweb-specific discussions of subject X
* '''[[wikify]]''' indieweb-relevant aspects of subject X, assuming Alejandro supports X on their personal site.
* '''Blog on their own site''' about subject X, ''instead of'' discussing in #indiewebcamp IRC.
* '''Refocus Alejandro''' on understanding/documenting their '''personal site itches''' on their User: page
* '''Help Alejandro''' with their documented personal site itches

Thus when a new person starts a hypothetical discussion about some subject X, use the following to redirect them to practical discussions, with one or more prompts/questions as needed. Keep asking these questions addressed to them personally ("Bob, ...") until you get them to either [[selfdogfood]] or document hypotheticals elsewhere (rather than our IRC channel). It's important to keep addressing them personally in order to make it clear you are asking them for a response.

* '''Alejandro, do you support X on your personal site?'''
** if so: '''Alejandro, could you wikify X on indiewebcamp.com, and add yourself in an "IndieWeb Examples" section?'''
** if not: '''Alejandro, could you point to documentation elsewhere about X instead of discussing it here?'''
*** if they do provide a URL to actual documentation, then thank them, and create a small stub page linking to it.
*** if they do not point to documentation: '''Alejandro, before discussing it here in #indiewebcamp IRC, could you write up a blog post on your own site first?''' (with the implication that they should provide a link to that when they're done)
** if they do not point to document nor seem amenable to blogging about it, then you must redirect the conversation to their personal site itches instead of subject X:
*** '''Alejandro, what's the next most important thing ('itch') you want to improve or fix on your personal site?'''
*** and then ask them to document their itches on their User: page per '''[[wikifying]]'''.
*** once they have added one or more personal itches to their Use: page, perhaps most importantly, <em>help them</em> (if you can) with the first thing on their list.
*** enabling them to build something for themselves that they care about is *incredibly* powerful and compelling, and they will hopefully find much more sustainably motivating/interesting than carrying on a hypothetical discussion about subject X.

Exceptions:

There are some hypothetical exceptions that are ok and useful for #indiewebcamp discussions:
* If the discussion is admitted brainstorming that is *on topic* for the indieweb, especially the first time on a subject, help it move along and encourage incremental [[wikifying]] of the brainstorm, even if just encouraging capturing it on a User: page as a personal site itch to scratch.
