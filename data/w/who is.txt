'''<dfn>who is</dfn>''' is when someone asks in [[discuss|chat]] "who is ''username''" and [[Loqi]] responds with a short summary from that person's wiki user page.

== How ==
* Add yourself to [[chat-names]]
* Edit [[Special:MyPage|your user page]] to add a short introduction. This is the text you want to appear when someone asks “who is ____”
* Wrap that text with a [[p-summary]]
** For example: <code><nowiki><div class="p-summary"> My name is John Doe and my website is example.com </div></nowiki></code>
