A '''<dfn>web application<dfn>''' or '''<dfn>web app</dfn>''' is an application written in web technologies that runs in a web browser, and sometimes standalone on some devices.

== Why == 
If you’re building a tool that helps a user get a specific task done but has little if any content of its own, consider building a web app.

== How to ==
There are many online tutorials on building web apps. If you found one that helped you in building your IndieWeb webapp, please add it here.

Technologies:
* [[HTML]]
* [[CSS]]
* [[Javascript]]

Techniques:
* [[progressive enhancement]]

Some general guidance:

Rather than using a [[JS]] [[framework]], you can use mostly HTML to build web applications by following some development guidelines. As described in this blog post and demonstrated with examples:

Keep the following in mind:
* Start with HTML. Keep the DOM stable and shallow. Don’t overuse classes
* Use CSS selectors and animation for little UI-behavior things when possible
* Aggregate your view-model on edge
* Server-side render with [[vanilla]]
* Behaviors instead of components
