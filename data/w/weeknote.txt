'''<dfn>weeknote</dfn>''' is a series of posts on a personal website where the author shares details about what they did in the last week.

== Why ==

* Weeknotes are a good way to reflect on what you have accomplished in the last week.
* You can look back on what you have written in the future to see how much you have done.
* You can see how you have evolved over time while reflecting on old notes.

== How ==

The most common way to share weeknotes is to write a blog post sharing your notes on what happened in your life in the previous week. Many weeknotes use bullet points to communicate notes as opposed to long-form prose, although there are community members that write long-form content in their weeknotes.

== Weeknote Prompts ==

Here are a few things you could talk about in your weeknotes:

* What you did with your personal website
* What you learned
* What media (books, TV shows, movies, etc.) you consumed
* Where you travelled
* What you ate
* How your work went
* Something interesting that happened to you

You can share as little or as much as you want in a weeknote. Weeknotes do not have to include personal information.

* {{capjamesg}} tried to write weeknotes but found it hard to think about what to include. James is revisiting the weeknote concept as of May 2022.

== Naming Variations ==

There are a few different concepts that are all mostly the same as weeknotes in content but may differ in cadence. These include:

* Life notes (mostly the same as weeknotes, but these may be written less frequently)
* "Recently" posts (which may or may not have a defined cadence)
* Week in Review
* Month in Review
