'''<dfn>Weather</dfn>''' is the state of the atmosphere at a place and time as regards heat, dryness, sunshine, wind, rain, etc.

Weather can be an attribute of a [[post]], a log of a passive experience, or an entity.

== Attribute ==

{{aaronpk}} stores weather data from an external source and has a pending [https://github.com/aaronpk/p3k/issues/63 issue] for [[p3k]] to add weather data along with location data for posts. 

== Passive Post ==

Weather can be the logging of a passive experience as a post on a site.

== Entity ==

An entire site can be for an entity, such as a weather station.

== Brainstorming == 
=== weather info on posts ===
The simplest use case for weather data is attached to a [[post]] of any type. This adds additional context to a post.

Example: Picture of Snowpocalypse...with the context of location and temperature.

Possible items in need of markup
* Temperature
* Relative Humidity
* Barometric Pressure
* Rainfall
* Windspeed and direction

=== weather info on homepage ===
* {{t}}: I kinda want different modifiers to my site icon depending on weather condition,  like, a 😷 for bad air, a cap for cold weather etc., perhaps seasonal icon decorations

There is a small and dedicated community of weather enthusiasts that are contributing data to sites such as [http://www.wunderground.com Weather Underground]. From the entity point of view, there is an opportunity for this data to appear as a useful activity stream.
