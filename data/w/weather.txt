'''<dfn>Weather</dfn>''' is the state of the atmosphere at a place and time as regards heat, dryness, sunshine, wind, rain, etc.

Weather can be an attribute of a [[post]], a log of a passive experience, or an entity.

== Why ==

Posting weather information on your website lets you show your readers the current environmental conditions in which you live. This may help them empathize with you over the weather.

Sharing your weather information may reduce the number of people who ask "how is the weather?" Even if people ask this question, you can point them to your website for detailed information.

== How ==

=== APIs === 

There are many free weather APIs available that provide accurate data covering:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Current weather conditions (i.e. rain, snow)
* Forecasts

These APIs include [https://darksky.net Dark Sky] (not accepting new signups), the Met Office API, the [https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/fetching-the-weather Raspberry Pi Weather Station API].

==== Advantages ====

* Historical data is readily available
* Weather APIs provide data on points that are difficult to collect on a home weather station (i.e. forecasts)
* ...

==== Disadvantages ====

* Some APIs like OpenWeatherMap restrict their APIs to certain endpoints for unpaid consumers
* See [[API]] criticism

=== Home Weather Station ===

Hosting a weather station at home is an option. A home weather station will let you collect information that is specific to your home, rather than data on your city from an API.

The Raspberry Pi Sense HAT is a good sensor to start working with if you are new to weather data and want to dip your toes into a home weather station.

==== Advantages ====

* Complete ownership over your weather data
* You can collect only the metrics you need
* You do not need to depend on silos (Dark Sky shut down)

==== Disadvantages ====

* You will need to buy your own sensors
* Setting up sensors may require some hardware knowledge
* Verifying the integrity of your data is difficult
** If a weather station is not correctly positioned, the weather data may be inaccurate.

=== Calum Ryan ===
Calum Ryan displays weather and temperature information per post [https://twitter.com/calum_ryan/status/736647306909495297 as of 2016-05-28].

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} displayed weather and temperature information per post [https://eddiehinkle.com/2017/12/28/4/note/ as of 2017-12-28] by fetching it from [https://darksky.net/dev Dark Sky API] as part of his [https://indieweb.org/2018-01-01-commitments#Eddie_Hinkle 2018-01-01 Commitment]. [https://eddiehinkle.com/2017/12/30/20/article/ Adding Weather to my Site]

[[File:eddiehinkle-weather-post-example.png|500px]]

He also has added some important historical weather to posts
[[File:eddiehinkle-weather-snow-example-post.png|500px]]

Eddie also uses his current location and the weather from that location to add weather effects to his homepage. [https://web.archive.org/web/20181115130517/https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/15/3/article/ as of 2018-11-15] he supports displaying animated snow if it is snowing at his current location.

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} displays weather and temperature information per post [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/12/30/10/weather as of 2017-12-30].

=== Daniel Goldsmith ===

{{dgold}} has been including current weather and temperature on his site since [https://ascraeus.org/micro/1515869778/ 2018-01-13]. He also [https://ascraeus.org/adding-weather-to-my-site/ posted a description] of the process and the resources used to enable this functionality

=== Jonathan LaCour ===

{{cleverdevil}} displays weather details based upon his current location on all posts as of 2019-01-16. Jonathan is using the [https://darksky.net/dev Dark Sky API].

=== James Gallagher ===

{{jamesgoca}} built a weather station with his [[raspberry pi]] which he used to track the weather at his location and in his workspace. This project is currently on hold.

== Attribute ==

{{aaronpk}} stores weather data from an external source and has a pending [https://github.com/aaronpk/p3k/issues/63 issue] for [[p3k]] to add weather data along with location data for posts. 

== Passive Post ==

Weather can be the logging of a passive experience as a post on a site.

== Entity ==

An entire site can be for an entity, such as a weather station.

== Brainstorming == 
=== weather info on posts ===
The simplest use case for weather data is attached to a [[post]] of any type. This adds additional context to a post.

Example: Picture of Snowpocalypse...with the context of location and temperature.

Possible items in need of markup
* Temperature
* Relative Humidity
* Barometric Pressure
* Rainfall
* Windspeed and direction

{{gwg}} suggests that all properties be marked up as either plaintext or an h-measure and that these properties be considered part of the location property. Specifically within an h-adr. Proposal for properties is as followed.

* p-temperature - Temperature
* p-humidity - Humidity
* p-weather - A textual description of the weather

=== weather info on homepage ===
* {{t}}: I kinda want different modifiers to my site icon depending on weather condition,  like, a ðŸ˜· for bad air, a cap for cold weather etc., perhaps seasonal icon decorations.

=== weather info on a separate page ===

* {{jamesgoca}} displayed his weather information on a subdomain on his site.

For weather overviews (i.e. just the temperature) then displaying weather data on every page on a site may make the most sense. For setups that collect more advanced data, weather information could appear on a separate page so as not to distract users.

== silo examples ==
[http://uksnowmap.com/ UK Snow Map] collates tweets with #uksnow in and location (by postcode or geotag) and snow intensity from 0-10

There is a small and dedicated community of weather enthusiasts that are contributing data to sites such as [http://www.wunderground.com Weather Underground]. From the entity point of view, there is an opportunity for this data to appear as a useful activity stream.
