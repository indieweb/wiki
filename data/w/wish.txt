A '''<dfn>wish</dfn>''' is a post indicating an [[acquisition]] or purchase either you wish to make or which you hope someone might purchase on your behalf for a birthday, anniversary, baby shower, wedding, or other event.

A [[collection|collected]] list of such physical goods could be considered a wishlist, or be used as a personal online gift registry, baby registry, or wedding registry.

These might also be called desires as well and could potentially include non-physical goods.

== Why ==
* Owning your own wishlist keeps it centralized closer to your online identity, which can more closely indicate that the things on it are for you as opposed to others. 
* Separate wishlists allow/encourage those making purchases on your behalf to chose the vendor or seller that best aligns with their particular shopping needs, potential price sensitivities, item availability, additional services, and shipping requirements. Maintaining multiple lists across multiple sites makes for poor user experience in helping others find things one may be interested in.

* Preventing data loss
** Example: Services like [[Amazon]] can remove the details from your bookmarked items in such a way that they're completely lost. Below is an example of two books that were bookmarked to a wishlist, but now one is no longer available (from the seller or via Amazon) and the data about the original item is completely lost and prevents it from being purchased from an alternate source.

__TOC__
=== Chris Aldrich ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} has been posting wishes on his site since [http://boffosocko.com/2016/07/19/the-memory-palace-of-matteo-ricci/ 2016-07-19] using the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] for [[WordPress]]. These are essentially simple notes with photos, links to the items on sites where they're available for purchase, and usually quick descriptions. Post Kinds also uses a shopping cart icon as a visual indicator for these posts. His aggregated wishlist can be found [http://boffosocko.com/kind/wish/ here].

== Silo Examples ==
=== Amazon ===
* [[Amazon]] has a relatively well built out wishlist functionality on their site that allows one to create [https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist multiple wishlists] (public or private) and share them with friends. Some time just before 2014-07-01 Amazon added the ability for one to bookmark things from sites outside of Amazon to one's wishlist as potential gift "ideas".
