A '''<dfn>wish</dfn>''' is a post indicating an [[acquisition]] or purchase either you wish to make or which you hope someone might purchase on your behalf for a birthday, anniversary, baby shower, wedding, or other event.

A [[collection|collected]] list of such physical goods could be considered a wishlist, or be used as a personal online gift registry, baby registry, or wedding registry.

These might also be called desires as well and could potentially include non-physical goods.
