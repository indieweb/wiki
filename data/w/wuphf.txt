A '''<dfn>[http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/WUPHF.com_(Website) wuphf]</dfn>''' was a [[notification]]-like [[posts|post]] type first featured on the [[cross-posting]] [[silo]] WUPHF.com that uses [[POSSE]]-like technology to link up all your communication portals so you're always in reach. When you send a Wuphf it goes to your home phone, cell [[phone]], [[email]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], nearby fax machines, and homescreen all at the same time. It represents "the last word in social networking". 

An example of a wuphf can be seen in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL1k7P-UR-4

The website and idea were featured as a fictious site launched around 2010-05-20 on [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1610229/ The Office in Season 6, Episode 26 "Wistleblower] and again in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1752583/ Season 7, Episode 9 "WUPHF.com"].

== Site Death ==
Like many silos, WUPHF.com was shut down soon after launching. The domain was later re-purchased and now redirects to the site [https://supplementhound.com/ Supplement Hound], an affiliate marketing site for supplements.
