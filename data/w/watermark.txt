{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>watermark</dfn>''' is text such as a name, signature, [[domain]], or graphic like personal logo that is overlayed on images such as [[photo|photos]], diagrams, and [[comics]], commonly with transparency for theft protection & traceability, or with high contrast so viewers can easily see the original author.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{petermolnar}} started using his domain around 2010 — petermolnar.eu that time — as a watermark, because it provided a simple way of showing the source of the picture. His watermarks are usually aligned to the bottom right of the image, rotated according to the layout of the photo.

== Other Examples ==
* Example of a URL in a comic as a watermark https://www.crunchnoisy.com/
