{{stub}}

'''<dfn>watermark</dfn>''' is usually a piece of information - such as text, domain, signature, name, etc - that is overlayed on images, commonly with transparency for two purposes: theft protection and traceability.

== Examples ==

* {{petermolnar}} started using his domain around 2010 - petermolnar.eu that time - as watermark, because it provided a simple way of showing the source of the picture. His watermarks are usually aligned to the bottom right of the image, rotated according to the layout of the photo.
