A '''<dfn>wedding</dfn>''' is an [[event]] [[use case]] that one may wish to document on their personal website as a way to plan, [[collection|collect]] memories, and [[archival_copy|reminisce over]] later as an [[anniversary]].

Sketch ideas posted by {{chrisaldrich}} on [https://boffosocko.com/2019/12/06/indiewebifying-your-wedding-a-brainstorm/ 2019-12-06]:

If you’re looking for general inspiration, the prior artwork of Pinterest, various registries, and other wedding sites will naturally be useful. But I think there are a number of IndieWeb building blocks that can be leveraged to accomplish a lot of what these sites do.

I think if I were doing it today, I’d meld some of the work from [[bookmarks]] and [[photos]] to create a [[Pinterest]]-esqe post type (probably by extending the [[Post Kinds Plugin]], maybe with a custom wedding type with a custom display).

There is lots of prior art on the registries front on the wiki under [[wish]] or wish lists. To goose things a bit, I’d definitely add referral links from places like Amazon.com, etc. and use the money either to make a donation to a charity in honor of the event or to defray honeymoon costs. If you want to encourage direct donations or funding mechanisms, there’s also some interesting prior art at the [[payment]] wiki page.

Now that the IndieWeb has some very solid support for [[event]]s and [[RSVP]]s, I might even try doing an online wedding invitation and collecting RSVPs. I’ve [https://boffosocko.com/2019/11/26/55759937/#I%E2%80%99ve%20noticed%20that%20Jacky%20Alcin%C3%A9 recently seen] {{jacky}} website leveraging [[commentpara.de]] to connect to [[Quill]] for [[comments]]/[[replies]], and it would be cool to get [[Quill]] to also add RSVP functionality to allow those without their own websites to RSVP using the non-anonymous functionality in [[commentpara.de]]. I suspect that since many people have trouble getting RSVP functionality into their sites, that {{aaronpk}} might be Tom Sawyered into providing that functionality as a quick and easy win for the broader community. (I’m not immediately aware of any other [[Micropub]] tools that do RSVPs though I may be wrong.) Of course potentially expanding it with [[food|meal options]] would be a lovely bonus so people can choose meat/vegetarian/other options. I’ll also mention that {{gRegor}} has been tinkering with RSVPs using [[Webmention]] on Twitter. As a minimal fallback, you can also allow people to respond directly in the built-in commenting system in WordPress, but if you’re going to do it…)

The biggest piece that would be fun to figure out would be to see how to get things set up to receive social media related wedding photos of the pre-, during, and post-event stuff back to my website from friends and family. Using [[bridgy]] with [[Twitter]] to pull back photos that tag your twitter user name is fairly straightforward, but I’m not sure that services like Flickr or Instagram may work as easily. This may require some thought and programming, but being able to [[backfeed]] social photos to your site or even providing friends and family a serviceable photo upload functionality to your site so you can document and keep photos from the event in real-time would be a cool win and could likely be a great feature for any event-related website to have built in or widgetized. It’s usually weeks or months for paid wedding photos to show up and it’s generally a big hassle finding all the online social photos, much less keeping copies of them, so having this could be both fun and useful, particularly for [[on this day|looking back on the event years later]].
