'''<dfn>Wedding</dfn>''' is an excellent type of [[event]] [[use case]] that one may wish to document on their personal website as a way to plan, [[collection|collect]] memories, and [[archival_copy|reminisce over]] later.

Sketch ideas posted by {{chrisaldrich}} on [https://boffosocko.com/2019/12/06/indiewebifying-your-wedding-a-brainstorm/ 2019-12-06]:

If youâ€™re looking for general inspiration, the prior artwork of Pinterest, various registries, and other wedding sites will naturally be useful. But I think there are a number of IndieWeb building blocks that can be leveraged to accomplish a lot of what these sites do.

I think if I were doing it today, Iâ€™d meld some of the work from [[bookmarks]] and [[photos]] to create a [[Pinterest]]-esqe post type (probably by extending the [[Post Kinds Plugin]], maybe with a custom wedding type with a custom display).

There is lots of prior art on the registries front on the wiki under [[wish]] or wish lists. To goose things a bit, Iâ€™d definitely add referral links from places like Amazon.com, etc. and use the money either to make a donation to a charity in honor of the event or to defray honeymoon costs. If you want to encourage direct donations or funding mechanisms, thereâ€™s also some interesting prior art at the [[payment]] wiki page.

Now that the IndieWeb has some very solid support for [[event]]s and [[RSVP]]s, I might even try doing an online wedding invitation and collecting RSVPs. Iâ€™ve [https://boffosocko.com/2019/11/26/55759937/#I%E2%80%99ve%20noticed%20that%20Jacky%20Alcin%C3%A9 recently seen] {{jacky}} website leveraging [[commentpara.de]] to connect to [[Quill]] for [[comments]]/[[replies]], and it would be cool to get [[Quill]] to also add RSVP functionality to allow those without their own websites to RSVP using the non-anonymous functionality in [[commentpara.de]]. I suspect that since many people have trouble getting RSVP functionality into their sites, that {{aaronpk}} might be Tom Sawyered into providing that functionality as a quick and easy win for the broader community. (Iâ€™m not immediately aware of any other [[Micropub]] tools that do RSVPs though I may be wrong.) Of course potentially expanding it with [[food|meal options]] would be a lovely bonus so people can choose meat/vegetarian/other options. Iâ€™ll also mention that {{gRegor}} has been tinkering with RSVPs using [[Webmention]] on Twitter. As a minimal fallback, you can also allow people to respond directly in the built-in commenting system in WordPress, but if youâ€™re going to do itâ€¦)

The biggest piece that would be fun to figure out would be to see how to get things set up to receive social media related wedding photos of the pre-, during, and post-event stuff back to my website from friends and family. Using [[bridgy]] with [[Twitter]] to pull back photos that tag your twitter user name is fairly straightforward, but Iâ€™m not sure that services like Flickr or Instagram may work as easily. This may require some thought and programming, but being able to [[backfeed]] social photos to your site or even providing friends and family a serviceable photo upload functionality to your site so you can document and keep photos from the event in real-time would be a cool win and could likely be a great feature for any event-related website to have built in or widgetized. Itâ€™s usually weeks or months for paid wedding photos to show up and itâ€™s generally a big hassle finding all the online social photos, much less keeping copies of them, so having this could be both fun and useful, particularly for [[on this day|looking back on the event years later]].
