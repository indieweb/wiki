A WXR file is a WordPress XML Archive

WordPress has an export tool that allows you to download an XML file of information on your blog to your device storage.

The XML file uses the WordPress Extended RSS format, also known as WXR.

You can use a WXR file to transfer your current WordPress blog to another website for basic content.

You can create a WXR file that contains all of the WordPress CORE supported information on your site or download portions of the site, such as posts or pages.


== Criticisms ==

* Due to design decisions taken by WordPress natural keys are not used such as URL path to content. Instead auto-generated keys are used, which makes merging difficult and complicates imports

* Due to the freedom some plugin authors exercise when authoring addons to WordPress core, export may not be able to act on all data of your site.
