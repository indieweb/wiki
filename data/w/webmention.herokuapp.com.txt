<dfn>'''[https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com]'''</dfn> is {{voxpelli}}'s [[Webmention]] endpoint as a service, for both receiving and displaying (via JS embed) webmentions.

== Purpose ==

Make it easy for people with either no backend, such as the ones on [[Jekyll]]-style sites, or who can't easily add [[Webmention]] support to their backend to still receive and show webmentions.

== Feature highlights ==
* Javascript embed that makes it as easy to show received webmentions as to eg. include a [[Disqus]] comment form
* Realtime webmentions â€“ new webmentions are pushed to the browser
* Almost has full CRUD-support for received webmentions (full support tracked in [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/issues/5 #5])
* ''Upcoming:'' [[Salmentions]] support, tracked in [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/issues/21 #21]
*''Upcoming:'' Full SWAT0-support, tracked in [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/milestones/SWAT0 SWAT0 milestone]
* + more

== Used technologies ==

* [[Node.js]]
* [[PostgreSQL]]
