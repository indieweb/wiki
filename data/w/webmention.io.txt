== Features ==

=== Accept webmentions for any site by adding an html tag ===

<pre>
<link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/example.com/webmention" />
</pre>

=== API to get a list of sites linking to your pages ===

Example: https://webmention.io/api/links.jf2?target=http%3A%2F%2Fwebmention.io

=== Sends [[Notification]] of Valid Webmentions via Web Hook ===

You can have webmention.io send an HTTP notification for each received, valid webmention to a URL of your choice. You may specify a different endpoint for each domain.

Optionally, you can configure a "callback secret" so that your HTTP endpoint can verify that the notification was sent by webmention.io.

== How to Use ==

If you want to use this right now, you can sign in on the home page https://webmention.io

Or you can install this on your own server from the [https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io source code on Github].

=== Use with Jekyll ===
[http://aaron-gustafson.com/ Aaron Gustafson] has written a [[Jekyll]] plugin for displaying content from webmention.io. 

* https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io

=== Using with other static site generators ===

* {{martymcguire}}'s [[Morris]] (self-hosted) can be used to store webmention data in json format, and then parsed if the static site generator supports data files.

=== Notification Web Hooks ===
* {{martymcguire}} has written a [[hubot|Hubot]] script to relay notifications to chat rooms. ([https://github.com/martymcguire/hubot-webmentionio-notify source], [https://martymcgui.re/2017/05/26/160758/ announcement])

=== Display with javascript ===
{{bret}} has written [https://github.com/resonance-cascade/webmention.js webmention.js]. Note it indicates that it "needs some work" and may not be actively maintained currently (last commit 2015-03-17).

{{beesbuzz.biz}} has written a library that is also imaginatively named [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js webmention.js].

{{kwaa.dev}} has written [https://github.com/importantimport/seia Seia], a Web Component.

== What does Webmention.io do? ==

** Add a <link> to webmention.io
** include this script and add some <code>&lt;div data-indiecomments data-url="blah"></div></code> element where you want them to appear
** see https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/104
