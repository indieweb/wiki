'''<dfn>[http://webvatar.com Webvatar]</dfn>''' was a service that provided direct URLs for <code><nowiki><img></nowiki></code> tags when you had the domain, or website address, of the user.

Thus, by using <code><nowiki><img src="http://webvatar.com/:website"></nowiki></code> (with or without the scheme -- <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>) you can shorten your need for servers and microformats2 parsing and still get people's pictures.

Webvatar was rewritten in [https://github.com/fiatjaf/webvatar/blob/master/web.go Go] from its original [https://github.com/fiatjaf/webvatar/blob/python/main.py Python] code and is now between 5 and 10 times faster than before (it also uses Cloudflare cache and an internal Redis cache helper to increase speed even more). It has support for microformats2 <code>u-photo</code> and <code>rel="icon"</code> and a lot of nice [http://webvatar.com/#how fallbacks] (mostly borrowed from other public services) for when no image is found.

As of September 3, 2015, Webvatar supported major silos like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, GitHub, Google+ and Trello URLs, so <code><nowiki>webvatar.com/https://twitter.com/fulano</nowiki></code> and variations would work. See examples below.
