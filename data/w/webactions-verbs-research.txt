= Verbs Research =

Research into current real-world usage of verbs for use with [[webactions]] (amongst other things). Link or it didn’t happen!

Mark up verbs in prose as bold (three apostrophes) so they can be scanned easily. TODO: make a table/tally of verbs

== Attendee Verb Usage ==

[[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] is publishing <code><action></code> elements for '''post''', '''reply''' and '''bookmark''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sq pic]) on his individual note pages ([http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1054/ example]), falling back to twitter’s tweet, reply and favourite intents if the note was [[POSSE]]d to Twitter. (I added a section to my [http://waterpigs.co.uk/articles/experimental-markup experimental markup] document explaining my choice of these verbs --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 13:27, 4 March 2013 (PST))

[http://eschnou.com Laurent Eschenauer] is publishing '''post''' verbs on his note lists and individual note pages ([http://eschnou.com/entry/on-silos-vs-an-open-social-web-indieweb---by-t-62-24891.html example]).

== Silo Verb Usage ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] inconsistently use:
* '''share''',
* '''update''',
* '''post''' for referring to the same action (of posting a new [[note]] to your timeline) and other actions, sometimes all at the same time ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sg pic], [https://www.facebook.com/help/120939471321735/ docs] - note the nav item name on the left contains both post and share). 
For comments, both 
* '''comment''' and 
* ''''write''' [a comment]' are used ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sh pic], [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/si pic]) — note inconsistency between 'comment' as the verb and object.
Their ubiquitous 
* '''like''' is not as branded as 'tweet', but nevertheless commonly associated with facebook ([https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=like google search for 'like']).

On sites across the web, facebook’s social plugins use yet more verbs: 
* '''share''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sh pic])
* '''send''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sj pic], [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/send/ docs])
* '''follow''' ([https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/follow/ docs])
* '''recommend''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sk pic], [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/ docs]).

=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] uses
* '''edit'''
* '''delete'''
* '''add''' [a comment] ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sl pic])
* '''favourite'''
* '''add''' [a tag|a note|a person|etc]
* '''view''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sn pic])
* '''post''' [comment] ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/so pic]) 
* '''upload''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sp pic]).

=== Google ===
[[Google]] uses[http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1047397&rd=2]
* '''+1''' - [[Google+]] branded verb
* '''share''' also often used  ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sa pic], [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sf pic])
* '''post''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sb pic]) in their documentation and UI
* '''recommend''' occasionally  
* '''reply''' ([http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/sc pic]) [http://www.google.com/+1/button/] 

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] uses[https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents] 
* '''tweet''' almost exclusively as their branded “post new content” verb
* '''retweet''' as their branded repost-other-content verb
* '''compose''' a lot to refer to the act of writing a tweet
* '''reply''' for tweeting a reply to a tweet.
