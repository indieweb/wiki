A '''<dfn>web application firewall</dfn>s''' is software that inspects HTTP requests and tries to block malicious or suspect requests, often with a high risk of false positives due to broad defaults, and limited effectiveness against a motivated attacker. 

They are often part of the offering of CDN providers like like [[Cloudflare]] and [[AWS WAF]].

An example is [[mod_security]].

If you are on shared hosting, your hoster might have one enabled by default, so be on the lookout for its reports in server logs when requests are failing without an obvious reason. It should log that it blocked a request and why it did so.
