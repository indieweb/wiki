{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>wl.gs</dfn>''' was apparently a service like [[twtmore]] for posting notes to [[Twitter]] over 140 characters by auto-truncating the tweet with a wl.gs permalink to the full note, all of which are now dead links that [[404]] (domain appears to be for sale). 

NEEDS: when to when was the service available/used, when did it shutdown, when did links die (and add to [[site-deaths]])

== Example ==
* https://twitter.com/feriyantoro/status/536595285620056064
(needs blockquote)

== See Also ==
* [[site-deaths]]
* [[twtmore]]
* [[link shortener]]
