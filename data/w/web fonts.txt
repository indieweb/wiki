'''<dfn>web fonts</dfn>''' are a way to serve custom fonts on websites, and used by some IndieWeb sites.

== Why ==
Web fonts are one way of presenting different [[typography]] as part of the visual [[design]] of a web site. Choosing different fonts can give your website a more unique and hand-crafted appearance.

=== Why Not ===
Web fonts can slow down page load times. Depending on the configuration, web fonts can either hide text while the page loads or cause layout shifts when switching to the new font. Consider limiting the number of web fonts and/or using web-safe system fonts instead.

== How to ==
See the MDN tutorial for how to get started using web fonts:
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts

=== How to self-host ===
Elliot Jay Stocks (guest article on Google Fonts site): [https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/using_type/self_hosting_web_fonts Self-hosting web fonts]

=== How to compress ===
