<div class="p-summary">'''There are many reasons <dfn>why</dfn>''' you should use the IndieWeb, from controlling your experience on the web (instead of corporate algorithms), to deciding where and when to post your content and where it goes.</div>

Perhaps you're done with others owning your content, your identity, and your self.

Our online content and identities are becoming more important and sometimes even critical to our lives. Neither are secure in the hands of random [[site-deaths|ephemeral]] startups or big [[silos]]. We should be the holders of our online presence.

=== Why have your own website ===

=== Identity and recognition ===
* Brad Frost:
<blockquote>Writing on your own website associates your thoughts and ideas with you as a person. Having a distinct website design helps strengthen that association. Writing for another publication you get a little circular avatar at the beginning of the post and a brief bio at the end of the post, and that’s about it. People will remember the publication, but probably not your name.&mdash; [http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/write-on-your-own-website/ Brad Frost]</blockquote>

=== Control and agency ===
* Christie Koehler: [https://twitter.com/christi3k/status/691748494827073536 On my blog I have control & agency] <blockquote>On my blog I have control & agency. Full server logs, ability to block abusive referrers, control of comments.</blockquote>
=== Better UI and UX ===
* '''Better UI/UX.''' E.g. better navigation and embedding than [[Twitter]], a simple citation UI [http://tantek.com/2011/009/t4/falcon-needs-reply-buttons-fave-rt-coming].
* You can make your site look how you want. You control placement of everything from images to text to anything you have written. If something looks off to you on a site you have made, you can change it.
=== Freedom ===
* '''Customisable visual design''': not everyone likes the visual design of sites like [[Twitter]] and [[YouTube]]. Being able to say "no, I don't want what you say I want, I want this", while still implementing the same set of standards means people have the freedom to innovate in graphical style.
* ''' The freedom to decide what content and what types of content to publish.''' Set your own rules and your own limits. [[User:Erikmaarten.com|Erik]] 21:53, 3 July 2013 (PDT)
** '''Longer notes.''' Host notes on your own site that are longer (perhaps even just slightly) than the 140 character Twitter limitation . [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 16:58, 27 February 2013 (PST)
=== More empowering ===
* '''Richer content embedding.''' Auto-embed images, video, and any other rich content you want from your own notes, instead of waiting for Twitter to implement it. E.g. compare [http://tantek.com/2013/054/t2/future-dystopia-beijing-blade-runner original] and [https://twitter.com/t/status/305570846796312577 tweet copy]. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 16:58, 27 February 2013 (PST)
* APIs only expose some aspects of your data: having your data under your control allows you to add new functionality to that data, adding new methods of discovery and connection based on the specific shape of that content.
=== More author centric ===
* You can write the kind of content you like in a way that you think is appropriate for your audience. If you like writing long essays, you can make a design that suits that need; if you like shorter notes or just want to share recipes, you can make a site that lets you do that.
* '''Link destinations see you / your site as a referrer''' and credit you with sending traffic. Some silos (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) wrap all links published in posts with their own link-redirectors (t.co, www.facebook.com/l.php?u=, www.youtube.com/redirect?q=) thus making the link destination think they're getting traffic from the silo in general, rather than from you and your profile. Links on your own site, however, notify destinations through the HTTP REFERER (sic) that your site (and thus you) are sending them traffic directly. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:09, 13 March 2013 (PDT)
* '''Amazon affiliate links work.''' As part of their link-wrapping strategy, silos (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) may strip affiliate information from Amazon links, and/or only link to the where an Amazon link redirects to, and/or add their own silo-specific Amazon affiliate code to all the Amazon links in your posts! When you publish Amazon affiliate links in posts on your own site, the links work as expected. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:09, 13 March 2013 (PDT)
* No visibility limits. There are no arbitrary character limits or limits on how much content you can see before clicking "See more" or "Read more".
=== More robust ===
* '''Fix links when they break.''' Another advantage of hosting your own content, you can fix links from your posts to others' sites when those links break. Real world examples:
** 2013-02-27 compare j.mp link vs longurl(edited 2013-058) on http://tantek.com/2010/145/t1/algorithmic-permashortlinks-diso-2-interview-ownyourdata). [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 16:58, 27 February 2013 (PST)
** 2014-05-13 http://tantek.com/2014/133/t2/moved-com-org-updated-links-indieweb-can
* ...
=== Reach more people ===
By publishing on your own site with good simple ad-free HTML you get better search engine rankings for your ideas than any ad-packed [[js;dr]] silo.

By [[POSSE]]ing your post from your site to [[silos]] of your choice, you reach those who read primarily inside those silos, in addition to traffic / readers from search engine results.

In total you get more traffic and your ideas [[reach]] more brains.

=== Emotional Support ===
Per 2015-05-04 <cite>[http://www.hipstercrite.com/2015/05/04/why-you-should-have-a-blog/ Why you should have a blog]</cite> as summarized by [https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/618866382076162048]:
<blockquote>Having a blog can get you through the tough times, the lonely times and the confusing times.</blockquote>

Or as mentioned in https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/:
<blockquote>It's a great way to have a place to "scream into the void"</blockquote>

=== Learn as you go ===

Building your own website is an opportunity for you to learn about web development. Because you are in control of your website, you can learn at your own pace. You can explore topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and content ownership in the context of your own ideas.

Whereas working on a corporate project involves meeting requirements that are usually set by someone else, you can set your own needs. This starts you on a journey toward learning the technologies that will enable you to bring your vision of your website to fruition. 

=== Avoiding problems ===
==== Content loss ====
* You're '''afraid''' of [http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/06/01/MobileMeReminder.png losing your photos and files][http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57445683-285/apple-reminds-users-of-mobileme-closure/][http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/technology/personaltech/goodbye-mobileme-hello-smugmug-dropbox-and-jimdo-state-of-the-art.html?pagewanted=all] (MobileMe closure).
* Or you've '''lost data''' due to badly written proprietary sync code (e.g. iTunes), or proprietary sync services (e.g. iCloud), and you'd rather use your own site (with more reliable/improvable open source software) to [[sync]] your data.
* Or you've '''lost content''' due to a [https://github.com/blog/744-today-s-outage production database being blown away], an [http://etherpad.com/transition.html acquisition shutdown], or [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10110443-36.html post-acquisition migrations] to services which were subsequently [http://closing.vox.com/ shut down]. 
** See [[site-deaths]] for chronology.
* Your content was speciously '''removed for "copyright reasons"''' (often via an [[algorithm]] and without simple recourse) despite the fact that it was fair use, news and analysis, or satire.
** <blockquote>"I plan to make ridiculous things more often. I initially had it up on SoundCloud but they took it down after a few hours as a copyright violation. Rather than fighting them about what my rights are, I’m just putting it up on my own site." &mdash;&nbsp;[http://bionicteaching.com/baby-snarf/ Tom Woodward]</blockquote>

==== Unreliability ====
* You're '''frustrated''' by the [http://farm1.staticflickr.com/186/420426227_dda4d24789_o.png downtime][http://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/420426227/] ([https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ablog.flickr.net+massage Flickr down]), [http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/twitter-outage-chart-downrightnow.png outage]([http://gigaom.com/2012/06/21/twitter-outage-thursday-morning-frustrate-users/ 2012-06-21 Twitter outage]), [http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5210/5322875194_908d728816_b.jpg maintenance]([http://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/5322875194/ Twitter maintenance]), [http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2571/3927590515_c3c6be51a9_o.png unscalability]([http://www.flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/3927590515/ Twitter over capacity]), and [http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5046/5331910087_585181744c_o.png database failures]([http://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/5331910087/ Tumblr database issues]) of web content hosting services.

==== Identity loss ====
(this subsection could likely use its own page)
* Your '''account was frozen''' because Google decided that you [http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-07-14/tech/29953907_1_google-services-google-account-google-rules violated the Google+ terms of service] (or [https://plus.google.com/115878613002809583306/posts/WsWj4CEhaK3 violated] their Gmail terms of service) and now you can't login to all those services you signed up for... using your Google ID. (more: 2012-04-14 [http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2012-04-14/how-i-lost-access-my-google-account-today], 2011-12-11: [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hey-google-thanks-for-making-my-daughter-cry/2011/12/12/gIQAhYx9pO_blog.html], [http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/n9l3a/hey_google_thanks_for_making_my_daughter_cry/], [https://plus.google.com/114311896476820866022/posts/QkKTxAbKGdq]: "There's no legal reason behind Google's decision to block my daughter's account. They've chosen to implement these age restrictions in this particular way. They've chosen to lock up my daughter's data without warning. They've chosen to threaten to delete the data."). Maybe you [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-jarvis/anti-washington-sentiment-_b_908117.html got bumped off Twitter for tweeting too much], or you had a product with millions of users and a fan community that was [http://socialfixer.com/blog/2013/09/12/beware-your-business-is-at-the-mercy-of-facebook-social-fixer-page-deleted-without-explanation/ abruptly shut down for an unknown reason]. Maybe you were [http://www.fbpurity.com/ banned for writing a browser extension which allowed users to take control]. Maybe you [https://danq.me/2011/11/24/banned-from-facebook/ got banned from Facebook for using a "fake name"], even though you'd already proven to them that it was your "real" name. Perhaps your account was [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbq3dm/twitter-banning-anyone-under-13-date-of-birth-gdpr banned by Twitter for retroactive reasons] as part of broad brush strokes due to new laws in other countries or territories? Maybe you got [https://twitter.com/jaredsinclair/status/1114598721738694662 shut out of your Tumblr account without explanation or reason]?

* Or you've been '''disappeared''' from a hosting service due to trademark claims or other reasons. 
** 2011-04-27: [http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/04/27/tumblr-disappeared-me.html Zephoria: "Tumblr disappeared me… "] (see also follow-up: [http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/04/28/a-customer-service-nightmare-resolving-trademark-and-personal-reputation-in-a-limited-name-space.html Zephoria: <abbr title="A Customer Service Nightmare: Resolving Trademark and Personal Reputation in a Limited Name Space ">Resolving Trademark and Personal Reputation</abbr>]). 
** 2012-12-13 NYTimes: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/technology/instagram-handle-metaverse.html Her Instagram Handle Was ‘Metaverse.’ Last Month, It Vanished.] <blockquote><p>Five days after Facebook changed its name to Meta, an Australian artist found herself blocked, with seemingly no recourse, from an account documenting nearly a decade of her life and work.</p>[…]<p>In 2012, she had started an Instagram account with the handle @metaverse…</p>[…]<p>Early that [Nov 2] morning, when she tried to log in to Instagram, she found that the account had been disabled. A message on the screen read: “Your account has been blocked for pretending to be someone else.”</p>[…]<p>On Dec. 2, a month after Ms. Baumann first appealed to Instagram to restore her account, '''The New York Times contacted Meta to ask why it had been shut down.''' An Instagram spokesman said that the account had been “incorrectly removed for impersonation” and would be restored. “We’re sorry this error occurred,” he wrote.</p><p>Two days later, the account was back online.</p></blockquote>'''Emphasis added.''' Restoring the account apparently required getting mainstream press to ask about it directly.

* Your '''identity is misrepresented''' by silos with no avenue to correct the false "facts," e.g.
** [http://amywilentz.tumblr.com/post/44228865923/google-killed-me Amy Wilentz: "Google Killed Me"].
** <blockquote>Facebook’s use of “ethnic affinity” as a proxy for race is a prime example. The platform’s interface does not offer users a way to self-identify according to race, but advertisers can nonetheless target people based on Facebook’s ascription of an “affinity” along racial lines. In other words. race is deployed as an externally assigned category for purposes of commercial exploitation and social control, not part of self-generated identity for reasons of personal expression. The ability to define one’s self and tell one’s own stories is central to being human and how one relates to others; platforms’ ascribing identity through data undermines both.</blockquote> -- via [http://reallifemag.com/friction-free-racism/ Friction-Free Racism] by Chris Gilliard, 2018-10-15 
* Or your '''identity was re-assigned'''. E.g. [http://reference.to/how%20safe%20is%20your%20twitter%20name?%20%5B2011%5D 2011 Twitter re-assigned @girlgeeks to a trademark holder], then reversed it eventually but only at request of said trademark holder; 2015 [https://medium.com/@ainiesta/how-instagram-closed-my-account-and-gave-it-to-a-football-celebrity-625a6a770eb3 How Instagram closed my account and gave it to a football celebrity]

* More examples: [[site-changes]]

==== Site loss ====
* Your '''blog was / is being removed''' because it's [http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/06/27/google-will-take-down-blogger-sites-on-june-30-which-host-adult-content-and-show-ads-for-adult-sites/ too racy by some undefined definition].
** Also see: [http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Tumblr-Porn-Adult-Content-Blogs-Takedown,news-16054.html Tumblr],  [https://twitter.com/violetblue/status/350183792096464896 @violetblue].
** 2016-07-14 [http://fusion.net/story/325231/google-deletes-dennis-cooper-blog/ Google deletes artist’s blog and a decade of his work along with it] ([[Blogspot]], [[Gmail]])

==== Censorship ====
* Or '''just one post was removed''' because a silo received a dubious [[wikipedia:DMCA|DMCA]] takedown notice or caved to legal threats, even when content is used under fair use/fair dealing provisions. Running your own site won't guarantee that someone won't abuse the DMCA, but you may stand a better chance than with some of the social media silos, who quickly cave due to fear or convenience (your sharecropping provides less benefit than avoiding dealing with DMCA trolls).
**Examples: [https://oliverhotham.wordpress.com/2013/08/11/the-sordid-tale-of-how-i-was-censored-by-straight-pride-uk/ wordpress.com] (note blog suspension threat also), [http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/02/site-plagiarizes-blog-posts-then-files-dmca-takedown-on-originals/ wordpress.com (again)], [https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121026/17190420859/leakid-dmca-takedown-notice-farce.shtml tumblr.com], [http://www.rebelliouspixels.com/2013/buffy-vs-edward-remix-unfairly-removed-by-lionsgate youtube.com], [http://readwrite.com/2011/04/28/anyone_can_take_down_facebook_pages_with_a_fake_email_address facebook.com], [http://justhugo.com/2015/10/16/freedom/ instagram]
* Sometimes sites with a content policy have removed content outside of that content policy.
** Examples: [http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/instagram-removes-photo-gay-newlyweds-kissing030714 Instagram removing picture of gay couple kissing as "inappropriate"], [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-clarifies-breastfeeding-photo-policy/8791 Facebook has been routinely removing breastfeeding images from 2008] until [http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/facebook_frees_the_nipple_finally_allows_breast_feeding_photos_partner/ 2014], as well as [https://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/facebook-bans-mastectomy-pix-anger-cancer-survivors-article-1.1363623 removing photos of mastectomy scars and removed groups where breast cancer survivors post such pictures].
* Sometimes sites with community guidelines remove content without indicating they're either doing so or without indicating which guidelines were violated
** Example [http://boffosocko.com/2018/02/16/facebook-is-censoring-my-notes/ Facebook is Censoring My Notes]
* [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/14/dennis-cooper-google-censorship-dc-blog Dennis Cooper fears censorship as Google erases blog without warning]

==== Content theft ====
* Your art has been '''sold without your permission''' (or notification!) to a third party who then profited from it, for example, [[deviantART#Selling_Your_Work|deviantART selling your work]].

* You aren't happy that '''[[silo]] owners could use your work without compensation'''. (Instagram's terms of service change in January 2013 will allow them to use your work for "in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you" - see [http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/12/why-you-should-want-to-pay-for-software-instagram-edition/266367/]).

* Your [http://waxy.org/2012/03/youtube_bypasses_the_dmca/ '''content was taken'''] and its ownership errantly transferred to a big content copyright holder / media company. (YouTube video upload, 2012)

==== Content And Identity Abuse ====
* You dislike your identity being used to advertise stuff you never consented to advertise. [https://plus.google.com/+MikeElgan/posts/eDTgkQTuvXA Facebook again].

* You dislike seeing '''your content on silos surrounded by ads'''. [[Facebook]] puts adds in the sidebar next to anything you post. Other [[silos]] do so similarly.

==== Personalisation/filter bubble ====
* Facebook attempts to target you specifically with content you enjoy and thus creates [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble filter bubbles]. Over-personalisation of content by social media silos means you are often left unexposed to material you would find interesting or informative but which the algorithm has decided isn't for you.
** See [http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1038261936872356908 If TiVo Thinks You Are Gay, Here's How to Set It Straight] (2002) for an early take on the "uncanny valley" feeling that you get when technology becomes too personalised.
* In 2012, Facebook conducted a study where they [http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-30/facebooks-emotional-manipulation-test-was-unethical-and-so-is-the-rest-of-social-media "manipulated the emotional content" of user's news feeds] in order to see how people would react if they changed the ratio of positive to negative stories in feeds. This study was done without the consent of the users and a member of Facebook's data science team [https://www.facebook.com/akramer/posts/10152987150867796 apologised] after the study was published and then criticised. Personalisation apparently now also includes personalisation for the purpose of psychological experimentation.

==== Negative community ====
* You aren't happy with the community or perceived community that comes baked in with the silo-based tools you use to publish. Perhaps you want to share photos of things you like without people making assumptions regarding your gender or race or social class (see danah boyd's [http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/PDF2009.html The Not-So-Hidden Politics of Class Online]).

* Being part of a social silo, community, or service may potentially paint a person's own identity negatively by being a member of the service. [https://www.wired.com/story/beto-orourke-cult-of-the-dead-cow-hacking-group/ 1]
** Some social media silos may start out with neutral or reasonable brands which don't reflect on their users' own identities or personal brands, but over time they may become toxic, problematic, or promote ideals which their users don't necessarily approve. 
** Some people have [[silo-quit|quit]] Twitter and Facebook because these services have allowed the spread of White Nationalist, Nazi, or genocide idealism(s), allowed users to cause harm to others, spread falsehoods, or even allowed other users to break the services' Code of Conducts with impunity.
** Some silos (example: [[deplatforming#Gab|Gab.ai]]) don't provide explicit marketing on their homepages about the types of (negative) community and members that they promote or encourage, but by being a part of the service and its network, people may unknowingly be branding themselves as aligning with a variety of principles  which they don't personally espouse.

==== Content lockdown ====
* [http://blog.norphil.co.uk/2017/06/photobucket-alert-new-sort-of-ransom.html Photobucket disabled hotlinking] which they formerly allowed for years, rendering many images unreachable from discussion boards.
* [https://neosmart.net/blog/2017/what-happens-when-imgur-goes-out-of-business/ What happens when Imgur goes out of business?]

==== Loss of Income ====
Attempting to build a [[business]] or income streams on social media can have devastating consequences if your account is throttled via algorithms or deleted for any reason including potential reported abuse or [[site-deaths]]. Services like Twitter and Facebook have a history of deprecating or removing [[API]]s which have destroyed businesses which were attempting to be built upon them.

==Why Indie Web Camp?==
* You're here because you know this and you want to design and build a web presence where you're in control.

* Maybe you bought your own domain for vanity reasons but now want to put it to good use.

We, the organizers of IndieWebCamp want that as well, and have started building it for ourselves.

Join us and together we can grow the IndieWeb.

==Why Indie Web Camp community?==
* Because building the IndieWeb is a continuous process. The IndieWebCamp ''event'' is inspiring, but we need to carry on doing so for more than a few days a year when we meet in real life.
* Because we can support one another and share the best way to do things.
* As we discover new ways to do things, we can '''document the crap out of them'''.
* Because some of you live out in the middle of nowhere. You are welcome to [http://indiewebcamp.com/Getting_Started join in too!]
