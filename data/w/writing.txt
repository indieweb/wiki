'''<dfn>Writing</dfn>''' is the act of [[creating]], expanding, editing, and updating primarily text [[posts]] such as [[note]]s and [[article]]s.

The challenges of how to best write and post were discussed at an [[IndieWebCamp]] in [[2015/Cambridge|Cambridge in 2015]] in the session [[2015/Cambridge/thoughtpost|Thought Draft Post]].

== How to ==
This section documents various techniques that IndieWeb community members use themselves to write better, more often, etc. on their own sites.
__TOC__
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has found the following helps him write better longform posts on tantek.com (both more quickly and of higher quality)
* Turn off Wi-Fi and use a CMS (he uses [[Falcon]]) that works locally offline[http://tantek.com/2015/221/t1/push-notifications-anathema-to-writing]

=== Gregor Morrill ===
{{gregor}} uses [[WriteMonkey]] on a PC to draft longer posts. It has a full-screen, no interruptions mode. Also has optional typewriter sound effects if you're into that.

=== Tracy Durnell ===
{{tracydurnell}} has posted novel writing [https://cascadiainspired.com/category/novel/ progress reports] on her website as an accountability and tracking tool, as well as during [[NaNoWriMo]]

=== Sara Jak≈°a ===
{{sarajaksa}} uses a couple of techniques, that get her to write more:
* Participate in the different events, like the [[blog_carnival|blog carnivals]], [[NaNoWriMo]], fanfiction gift exchanges and prompts challenges.
* Writing in her own version of the [https://writtenkitten.co/ Written Kitten] that can use any set of pictures, which she hosts [https://sarajaksa.eu/writtenkitten/ on her site]. She used to use the [https://v2.writeordie.com/ Write or Die] and it did make her write more, but these days she prefers a more positive motivation. 
* Having the writing environment, that works offline - a lot of her writing is done offline. 
* The 'Don't Like Don't Read' mentality, which poses the responsibility for deciding to read on the reader - so there is no need for any piece of writing to be perfect.
* The 'potter' mentality (from the making of the pots experiment), where people improve more, if they simply do something more frequently, instead of trying to make it perfect.
* Writing so much, that writing had become a way of therapy and emotional control

=== ... add yourself ... ===
Please add the techniques you actually use yourself to write on your site! 

Please do not add techniques you recommend but do not use (or use infrequently), or especially do not use on your personal site. There are too many random lists of "recommended" techniques (that the authors either themselves do not follow or do not do so on their own sites - both instances of [[selfdogfood]] failures).
