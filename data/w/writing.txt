'''<dfn>writing</dfn>''' is the act of [[creating]], adding & editing content for, and updating primarily text [[posts]] such as a [[note]] or especially an [[article]].

The challenges of how to best write and post were most recently discussed at an [[IndieWebCamp]] in [[2015/Cambridge|Cambridge in 2015]] in the session [[2015/Cambridge/thoughtpost|Thought Draft Post]].

== Sessions ==
IndieWebCamp sessions discussing how to be / become a better writer, and how to write more often & more quickly.
* IndieWebCamp Cambridge 2015: [[2015/Cambridge/thoughtpost|Thought Draft Post]].
* ...

== Techniques ==
Various techniques indieweb community members themselves use on their sites to write better, more often, etc.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has found the following helps him write better longform posts on tantek.com (both more quickly and of higher quality)
* Turn off Wi-Fi and use a CMS (he uses [[Falcon]]) that works locally offline[http://tantek.com/2015/221/t1/push-notifications-anathema-to-writing]

=== Gregor Morrill ===
{{gregor}} uses [[WriteMonkey]] on a PC to draft longer posts. It has a full-screen, no interruptions mode. Also has optional typewriter sound effects if you're into that.

=== Tracy Durnell ===
{{tracydurnell}} has posted novel writing [https://cascadiainspired.com/category/novel/ progress reports] on her website as an accountability and tracking tool, as well as during [[NaNoWriMo]] 

=== ... add yourself ... ===
Please add the techniques you actually use yourself to write on your site! 

Please do not add techniques you recommend but do not use (or use infrequently), or especially do not use on your personal site. There are too many random lists of "recommended" techniques (that the authors either themselves do not follow or do not do so on their own sites - both instances of [[selfdogfood]] failures).
