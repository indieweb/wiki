'''<dfn>[http://weblikes.org/ Weblikes]</dfn>''' is a simple protocol for adding [[like|likes]] to pages on the open web built by [http://scripting.com Dave Winer].

The project is open source and is maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/scripting/likes.

== IndieWeb examples ==
* [http://scripting.com Dave Winer] has been using the system on his website since at least [http://scripting.com/2018/11/10.html#a155558 2018-11-10] ([[self-dogfooding]])
** UI example: http://scripting.com/2018/11/29.html#a211652

== Criticism ==
While the project site describes weblikes as "outside of any silos", it relies heavily on Twitter for identity and authentication and thus is a major potential source of future failure. 

The service doesn't allow the person leaving the like to keep a copy of their own data or easily find it on a site after-the-fact.
