'''<dfn>Web hosting</dfn>''' can be the primary regular cost in maintaining an IndieWeb site; this page lists several options from free on up depending on your publishing needs, like a static, shared, private, or dedicated server. 

Typical for-pay hosting services more expensive than most domain name registrations/renewals. Web hosting services serve web pages on a domain of your choice.

== Criteria ==
Hosting providers aren't one size fits all. Picking one is in some ways like picking a cell phone provider. There are lots of factors that determine whether a given provider is right for you personally. etc. Here are some questions you'll want to think about to get started.

* How much code do you want to write: none, some, lots? 
* How much are you willing to pay? Nothing, a little, or more?
* Do you want individualized customer support?
* Do you need any guarantees on availability, e.g. an SLA?
* How much risk tolerance and security expertise? Will you keep up with patches, etc?
* If you're technical, do you need a shell account? Do you need root?

See [[hostingnotes]] for some unstructured notes on the offerings of specific providers (in early 2014).

== Services by Type ==
Here are various levels of web hosting service available from different providers, roughly ordered from easiest/cheapest/friendliest to most powerful/technical.

=== Custom domain silos ===
Some [[silos]] allow you to configure your profile to use your own domain name, thus at least giving you some ownership over your permalinks (that you can potentially transfer to your own web host later) and are thus worth considering as a content hosting service.
* '''[[micro.blog]]''' ($5/mo): [http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/ instructions]
* '''[[Tumblr]]''' (free): [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_domains instructions]
* '''[[WordPress.com]]''' ($5/mo): [https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/all-about-domains/ instructions]
* '''[[Squarespace]]''' (starts at $8/mo): [https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205812088 instructions]
* '''[[Blogger]]''' (free): [http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/static.py?hl=en&ts=1233381&page=ts.cs instructions]
* '''[[NeoCities]]''' ($5/mo): [https://neocities.org/supporter] 

'''micro.blog''' is highly recommended. It provides [https://help.micro.blog/2017/indiewebcamp/ almost complete hosted IndieWeb]. It supports [[articles]], [[notes]], [[photos]], [[replies]], [[podcasts]] custom domains, [[microformats]], [[micropub]], [[webmentions]], and [[IndieAuth]] out of the box. (The one caveat is webmentions to/from external sites. As of 2019-02-01, [https://www.manton.org/2018/10/09/webmention-improvements-on.html they're still in progress], particularly [https://github.com/microdotblog/issues/issues/75#issuecomment-459856232 sending outbound webmentions from original posts].)

[[Tumblr]] is also recommended as a second choice because:
* It has beautiful, usable, mobile friendly default templates
* It has a friendly [[posting]] and [[admin interface]]
* It has many posting options (web, mobile apps, email, instant messaging)
* It supports user-centric site [[icons]] (your profile icon/avatar is automatically hosted as your personal site [[icon]])

==== Advantages of custom domain silos ====
* Zero maintenance. No software or servers for you to maintain or update (e.g. security updates).

==== Disadvantages ====
* Choice of configuration typically limited to templates
* Terms of service may limit your options for monetizing your site.
* Maintaining URL permalinks may be challenging when you switch to another (more self-owned / self-run) solution.

=== Hosted CMS Software as Service ===
Some open source software is hosted on various domains and can be set up to serve your personal domain for you.
* '''[[Known]]''' (free): [http://withknown.com]
* '''[[Wordpress.com]]''' (small fee): [http://en.support.wordpress.com/domain-mapping/ instructions]
* '''[http://wpengine.com/ WP Engine]''' (fee): [http://wpengine.com/support/add-domain-in-client-portal/ instructions]
* '''[[IndieHosters]]''' (fee): [https://indiehosters.net]

==== Advantages of hosted CMS software ====
* Regular security updates 
* Easier migration from hosted to your own web server / VPS (as compared to silos above).

==== Disadvantages ====
* Choice of software platform typically limited to plug-ins and perhaps javascript.
* Terms of service may limit your options for monetizing your site.

=== Static domain hosting ===
Simpler and more portable to a dynamic content web hosting solution, static hosted domain solutions are (likely) even more reliable while still be free or very cheap:

File hosting services which provide serving static files over HTTP

==== Advantages of static hosting ====
* Very cheap. (See [http://indiewebcamp.com/Amazon_S3#Date_Edge Date Edge's usage/billing])
* ...

==== Disadvantages ====
* Complicated to set up.
* ...

==== Dropbox ====

* [https://dropbox.com Dropbox] (free)
* See the [[Dropbox|main article]] for guides and services that help host a small static site on Dropbox.

==== GitHub Pages ====
{{main|GitHub}}
* [https://pages.github.com GitHub Pages] (free) - GitHub Pages is designed for hosting simple static web pages. In addition to [https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages github's instructions], there are several guides on how to use GitHub Pages to host your website:
** Based on [[Jekyll]]
** http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/extras/github-pages.html
** Example: [http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/08/11/now-powered-by-jekyll-and-github-pages/ BootStrap blog powered by Jekyll and Github pages]
** An advantage to using a Github based solution is that you can easily transfer it to another web host simply by deploying from github to your web host.

==== Amazon S3 ====
{{main|Amazon}}
* '''Amazon S3''' (very cheap): [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html instructions] (via [https://twitter.com/aral/status/290841566422118403]). 

==== Google Cloud Platform ====
{{main|Google}}
* Static hosting can be done using [https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/website-configuration Cloud Storage] service.

==== Netlify ====
{{main|Netlify}}
* '''Netlify''' (free) - Supports various static site generators: [[Jekyll]], Grunt, [[Middleman]], Hexo, [[Hugo]], [[Gatsby]]

=== Shared Hosting ===
FTP access with PHP or Perl CGI in a [[shared hosting]] environment
* [[Dreamhost]]
* [https://www.sollhost.com/web-hosting SollHost]
* [http://www.krystal.co.uk Krystal] UK Based, very good shared servers with incredible support. They have packages for both beginners and large companies alike.
* [http://pair.com/ Pair] has been around forever, has lots of reasonable plans, and is generally very clueful.
* [http://freeshell.org/ freeshell.org] aka the SDF Public Access UNIX System
* [https://www.webfaction.com/ Webfaction] has lots of plans, supported languages and databases; runs Apache/ngnix.

* [http://empoweringmedia.com/ Empowering Media], which is shutting down in the near future as of 2/23/2019.
** [https://supportem.com/submitticket.php Supportem Submit Support Ticket]

==== Other Opinions ====
* [http://www.hostjury.com/ HostJury] is a crowd-sourced web host review service, though whether the crowd is sufficiently large and diverse to reduce the bias to a useful level is unclear.

==== Advantages of Shared Hosting ====
* No ads or other items on your page
* Zero <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>/LAMP maintenance. Shared hosting services will automatically handle updating your server's operating system, HTTP server, language support (e.g. PHP).
* Ability to install your own backend scripts (e.g. PHP) to run your website
* ...
==== Disadvantages of Shared Hosting ====
* Little to no choice of HTTP software. Typical shared hosts require you to use whatever HTTP server they maintain, e.g. Apache, Lightspeed HTTP, etc. HTTP server software then becomes another factor in how you pick a shared hosting provider.
* Fixed bandwidth/storage limits (typically)
* Very little configuration control, eg of domain setup
* Usually no ability to use newer technologies like websockets
* Unless you're relatively technical, apps are installed through stores like [[Installatron]] that are themselves silos
* ...

==== Advantages of a server ====
* Full control (as VPS) and speed; no need to share resources beyond bandwidth
* large disk space could be used for online backup and server could be a host for a group of sites/peole

==== Disadvantages ====
* Price (although depending on load they can be more cost effective than a VPS)
* See VPS

=== Home server ===

Home Hosting (or self-hosting) is the practice of keeping your personal data at home on a [[home server]], typically on [[home_server#Second-hand_hardware|second-hand hardware]] or [[home_server#Single-board_computers|single-board computers]].

Setting up a [[personal cloud]] allow unexperienced users to administrate their own server at home through nice [[user-interface|user interfaces]].

Hosting services on a dynamic IP address requires to use a [[home_server#Hosting_services_on_a_dynamic_IP|dynamic DNS provider]].

For more information about self-hosting, see [[home_server|home server]].

==== IndieWeb community members using this approach ====

* {{Template:strugee}} since 2011-12-19 (but only really started hosting real services [https://github.com/strugee/strugee.github.com/commit/96e1455b54a0f6b37f1ce6e3e2fffe464755baab 2014-08-19])

=== Appliance Server ===

Similar to a VPS except the server is pre-configured to run an application for you. The appliance server is chosen based on the application you want to run. This might help less technical users get started with their own server.

* [https://networkpresence.com.au/hosting/appliances.html Network Presence]

==== Disadvantages ====
* More expensive than a VPS

== FAQ ==
=== Is using 3rd party hosting still indieweb ===
Q: If you use one of the 3rd party hosting options above (i.e. everything except for home hosting), you are still  hosting your content on a webserver which is controlled by a third party, which thus could control your data. How is a setup where a 3rd party could control your server and data still indieweb?

A: Since it's the indie*web*, not indie everything, the important part is to own your web identity, which basically means owning the URLs. As long as you control the URLs, you can move between backend providers as you wish. You are in control of your online identity if you own the URLs.
