A '''<dfn>[https://www.kickscondor.com/whostyles/ whostyle]</dfn>''' is a type of stylesheet that can be used to style syndicated hypertext and quotes outside of your website. It is a working draft, started by [[User:Www.kickscondor.com|Kicks Condor]] in November 2018.

Possible uses of a ''whostyle'' could be to style:

# Posts in a feed reader.
# Quotes from another site.
# Comments from other sites.
# Embedded posts throughout the Web.

Whostyles only apply to the container for the syndicated hypertext. This usually means that the hypertext is placed in an <code>iframe</code> along with [https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/ sanitize.css].

__TOC__

== Rationale ==
Whostyles help preserve one's intended appearance for the text. This may seem purely aesthetic - but this also enables one to preserve complex layouts and tables in syndicated hypertext.


== Details ==
TODO: There is more to write here about creating 'whostyles' one it firms up - see the first link in this document for the current details.
