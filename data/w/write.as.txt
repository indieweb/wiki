== Criticism ==
* It takes a paid plan to edit the header and footer. This makes adding links with rel="me" or code for web rings difficult
** <blockquote>@dogtrax Yes reading forums you have to have a paid account to add HTML to the footer. How do you get your by;line "A place to gather words before they get lost." wonder if you can there? I think it might be a paid feature<cite><a href="https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2019/09/29/dogtrax-yes-reading-forums-you-have-to">{{jgmac1106}}</a></cite></blockquote>
