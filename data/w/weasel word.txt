A '''<dfn>weasel word</dfn>''', phrase, or expression is a way of making a statement or argument by attributing it to a vague third party ("some say") or hypothetical party ("it can be said" or "[[it is considered]]"). Weasel wording makes it sound like a reasonable argument is being made, when no one is actually making a specific statement.

Instead of weasel words, just make the argument yourself, or cite a specific source that is making the argument.
