'''<dfn>who can reply</dfn>''' is a 2020 feature of [[Twitter]] that allows the author of a tweet to explicitly choose from a set of options of which accounts Twitter will allow in their UI to reply and thus show replies from; the IndieWeb equivalent could be implemented with some combination of [[allow lists]] and [[Vouch]].

This feature is a per-tweet setting that must be configured before posting.

* Can‚Äôt set a different default (e.g. "People you follow") in your settings, you have to set it per tweet every time before tweeting
* Can‚Äôt set who can reply in Twitter posting APIs. Their APIs do not yet (as of 2021 June) support "who can reply" or otherwise limiting who can reply to your tweets. https://twittercommunity.com/t/choose-who-can-reply-to-your-tweet/156174
