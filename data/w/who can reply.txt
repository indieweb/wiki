'''<dfn>who can reply</dfn>''' is a 2020 feature of [[Twitter]] that allows the author of a tweet to explicitly choose from a set of options of which accounts Twitter will allow in their UI to reply and thus show replies from; the IndieWeb equivalent could be implemented with some combination of [[allow lists]] and [[Vouch]].
