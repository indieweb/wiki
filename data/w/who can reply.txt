'''<dfn>who can reply</dfn>''' is a 2020 feature of [[Twitter]] that allows the author of a tweet to explicitly choose from a set of options of which accounts Twitter will allow in their UI to reply and thus show replies from; the IndieWeb equivalent could be implemented with some combination of [[allow lists]] and [[Vouch]].

Screeenshot of a Twitter iOS tweet writing UI with the "Who can reply?" menu expanded showing:
* 🌍✅ Everyone
* 👥 People you follow
* ＠ Only people you mention

== Limitations ==
This feature is a per-tweet setting that must be configured before posting.

Limitations:
* You can’t change it for a tweet after you’ve posted
* You can’t set a different default (e.g. "People you follow") in your settings, you have to set it per tweet every time before tweeting
