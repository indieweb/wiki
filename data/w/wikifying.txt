{{stub}}

'''<dfn>wikifying</dfn>''' is the practice of capturing information and ideas on the wiki. E.g. "We need to wikify that [[FAQ]], concept, jargon, or [[etherpad]]".

Follow the step by step directions on this page to:
* edit your user page (by signing into the wiki your page gets made automatically).
* (optional) add your self to /chat-name
* (optional) create a [[sparkline]] so there is a picture next your user name
* Contribute to the wiki community

== Why ==
Wikifying both in general, and particular subjects, notes, or documents, helps grow the searchable & discoverable [[commons]] of the IndieWeb community.

Is it IndieWeb related? Great, add it to the wiki. Not sure? See examples of what (not) to add:
* [[#Should_this_be_on_the_wiki|FAQ: Should this be on the wiki?]]

== How to Join the IndieWeb Wiki  ==

If you have a website compatible with indielogin your user page is made as soon as you sign in. You do not "join" this wiki like traditional wikis where you get a username and password. Having your own websites is all you need 

=== Wikify yourself ===

If you haven't done so already, set up your own domain with rel-me links (see [[Getting Started]]) and use [[IndieAuth]] to log into the wiki.

==== Make your user page ====
Like many things in the IndieWeb, start by editing [[Special:MyPage|your own user page]]. Click that link, then click "edit this page."

If you're not sure what to put on your user page, start with your name and URL in an [[h-card]]:
<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-card">[http://example.com/ Your Name]</span>
</nowiki></pre>

Or you can use the [[Template:Infobox_person|Infobox person]] template to make a more detailed profile page.

Your user page is also linked at the top right, with the domain name that you logged in with, just before "My Talk".

==== Setup a nickname with a small h-card template ====
Get {{t}} with <pre><nowiki>{{t}}</nowiki></pre>
Instead of [[User:Tantek.com]] <pre><nowiki>[[User:Tantek.com]]</nowiki></pre>

To make a small h-card template that allows you to easily add your name, link, and photo to a wiki page:

* On any wiki page, add: <code><nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki></code>
** Replace "yourname" with your name or screen name
* Click the resulting link to edit the template.
* Copy, paste, and edit with your information (note that you do '''not''' edit the word ''sparkline''):
<pre style="line-height: 1.4em; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid #ddd; color: black; background-color: #f9f9f9; white-space: pre-wrap;"><nowiki><span class="h-card">{{sparkline| http://example.com/your-profile-image.jpg}} [[User:Example.com|Your Display Name]]</span></nowiki></pre>

==== Write down your itches ====
{{main|itches}}
Next, add an itches section where you capture '''what you want to work on for your own site''', personal online digital presence, and personal digital device usage (e.g. even when offline) in general. E.g.

<pre><nowiki>
== Itches ==
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* Figure out a [[URL design]] for my posts
* Start posting [[notes]] manually at [[permalinks]]
* Try checking my site in indiewebify.me
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site
</nowiki></pre>

When you start collecting lots of itches, you may want to start prioritizing them, especially by what you're currently working on. Start a "Working on" section for that:

<pre><nowiki>
== Working On ==
* the next thing I'm working on for my site
* the next next thing I'm working on getting working on my site
* ... etc.
</nowiki></pre>


Lastly, check out others' User: pages, especially folks that have been doing this a while, to see what else you could add to yours and work on.
* {{t}}
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{GWG}}
* {{kylewm}}
* {{benwerd}}
* {{gregorlove}}
* {{chrisaldrich}}
* ...

==== Focus ====
As this is the IndieWeb, and this is about your IndieWeb user page, it should be about answering this question, continuously:
* '''What is the next thing you want to get working on your personal site?'''

This means for example that the following are better left out and pursued elsewhere - like on your own site!
* A personal to do list (of other non-personal-site things) - your IndieWeb user page is about work on your '''personal site'''.
* Asking others to do work for you. Note: requests for help with IndieWeb specific itches/projects are ok, but address them to everyone, not just individuals. This is about what '''you want to work on''' - not asking others to do work.
* Trying to get silos to do things, in general or with specific accounts - instead, document individual silo issues on the specific [[silo]] wiki pages, and follow-up there. Your itches should be about '''your personal site''', not silos.

== How to Contribute to the IndieWeb Wiki ==
=== Incremental Wikifying ===
{{main|expand a page}}
There's lots of incremental wikifying to help with.
* fixing typos
* adding IndieWeb Examples - if you find a page for a technology you support on your site, or a project you use on your site, add yourself to the "IndieWeb Examples" for that page
* add issues and questions (for FAQs)
* collect questions/answers from [[discuss|chat]] and add them to the appropriate wiki page
* organize the content of a growing page into sections per [[expand a page]]

See '''[[to-do]]''' for many wiki-related items that you can help with!

=== Add Citations ===
Whenever you see [[Loqi]] (or anyone frankly) share or post a link in [[discuss|chat]] to something relevant to the indieweb, please help out by adding those as citations/examples to the wiki, and especially if they're photos, add them to event page(s).

==== Format citations ====
Here's how to "text format" citations to add them, from a minimum, to incrementally doing more work (or improving existing citations!)
;link
:seriously, it's ok to just add a link, that's helpful!
;YYYY-MM-DD link 
:adding the article's publication date helps a lot by placing the link in a temporal context 
;YYYY-MM-DD [link article-name]
:even better, go get the article name which is likely more readable/understandable/searchable/discoverable than the link. Is it a tweet link or lacking a name? Pick a summary sentence instead.
;YYYY-MM-DD author<nowiki>:</nowiki> [link article-name]
:even better, add the author to help provide authority or at least the context of who-from
;YYYY-MM-DD <nowiki>{{indiewebauthor}}:</nowiki> [link article-name]
:even better, if the author is a participant in the indieweb community use the {{}} template for their shortname / chat nickname to link their name, perhaps even provide their icon automatically
Optionally:
* Add a <code>blockquote</code> ''inline'' at the end of the citation, with key relevant sentence(s) copy/pasted/quoted from the link, like this: 
<pre>YYYY-MM-DD [link article-name] <blockquote>key relevant sentence(s)!</blockquote></pre>

These are all super-easy (nearly completely) plain-text ways of just pasting/typing the information into the wiki. (Nearly) No code or markup to learn or figure out or debug. Don't worry about not being perfect, others can help with tweaking fixing things.

Keeping wiki pages mostly plain-text-like makes them easier for others to edit and improve as well!

The important thing is to just take the step of adding the information.

If you like or are familiar MediaWiki templates, you can also use:
* [[Template:citation]]

==== Where to add a citation ====

If you don't know where in a page to put a citation, add it to the '''See Also''' section at the end.
* You can even do this from [[discuss|chat]] by using the << trick like this:
<pre>wikipagename << YYYY-MM-DD [link article-name]</pre> etc.

If the citation is criticism, add/move it to the '''Criticism''' section of the article.

These are all incremental steps. None are required. All are something you can help with.

Every incremental step you can help with above helps the wiki.

Even just one incremental improvement is helpful!

=== New pages ===
{{main|start a page}}
There's lots of new page creation you can help with. Create new wiki pages for:
* new concepts or terms being discussed, e.g. in [[discuss|chat]]
** start with <nowiki>{{stub}}</nowiki> and a short definition!
** especially if they're indieweb-related in some way
* etherpads of notes from [[IndieWebCamp]] sessions after they're finished, to archive the session notes somewhere more findable / linkable
* new projects you start using on your personal website; be sure to include your site in the IndieWeb Examples section on the page.

If something is not particularly indieweb-related, e.g. it didn't come up in the discussion of things that are indieweb-related, perhaps consider documenting it on Wikipedia instead (and/or using Wikipedia as a reference/citation).

=== Document your decisions ===
Once you've documented yourself on your User page, and started incrementally documenting your "Itches" and "Working On", as you get work done and deploy to your personal site, document your "major decisions", on your user page or perhaps in a "Implementation Design" section on your project page.

Examples:
* [[Falcon#Implementation_Design]] - major design decisions made in [[Falcon]] so far.

Documenting your major design and implementation decisions will help you better consider when to revisit them, and when to work on new personal site features and functionality instead.

=== Define jargon ===
Any time someone uses a jargon term in [[discuss|chat]], or other indieweb related communications, go ahead and ask in the channel:
* <kbd>What is jargon term</kbd>
This will prompt [[Loqi]] to either answer with the definition with the wiki, or to prompt you to define it with a link to create the page on the wiki.

You can then define it by clicking on that link, or answer answer the what is question:
* <kbd>A jargon term is a specific unobvious concept, or re-use of a word to mean something other than its common meaning.</kbd>

Avoid repeating words from the term, avoid generic abstract definitions, and minimize use of jargon terms in a definition (though use them if necessary, and then link/define them too).

Be specific and meaningful in definitions, certainly more than just a link and/or restatement using the same or similar terms.

==== Definitions include indieweb relevance ====
When defining a term, include why it is specifically relevant to the indieweb (if that's not obvious from the description), beyond just a "normal" definition that could have come from Wikipedia (no need to replicate or summarize Wikipedia here, and do not copy from Wikipedia, instead link to it).

E.g. the above example could be improved with indieweb relevance like:
* <kbd>A jargon term is a specific unobvious word, concept, or technology (like Webmention), or re-use of a word to mean something other than its common meaning (like feed), or sometimes re-using a word as an acronym (like POSSE).</kbd>

=== Tweetable definitions ===
Check the definitions on wiki pages, and edit them so they are tweetable, as there is evidence that people will tweet good definitions that are of tweetable length (including a subsequent link to the page) - that's 116 characters (space + 23 characters for the tco'd link).

* https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/688791904356581376 <blockquote>Site deaths are when sites go offline, taking content and permalinks with them, and breaking the web accordingly. http://indiewebcamp.com/site-deaths </blockquote>
** Note that he edited the dfn of [[site-deaths]] (as of that time) and removed "their" in order to make it fit on [[Twitter]].

=== Progressive disclosure of content ===
A simple jargon-free (or minimal) tweetable definition is an important first step in providing content that is understandable by a broader audience, while still documenting all the important research and details that are discovered or invented by the community.

Nearly every page on the wiki can be improved in this regard, to provide [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure progressive disclosure] of relevant content.

That is, wiki pages should start with offering quick, definitive information to a beginner.

And then incrementally document details only as needed for real world reasons / use-cases that provide benefits to those reading.

E.g. [[getting started]] can (still) be continuously improved in this regard. As can [[web hosting]].

=== Common Page Structure ===
Most pages on the wiki have evolved to have a fairly common page structure, starting with a simple definition, and then adding additional sections such as:
* Why
* How to
* IndieWeb Examples
* Brainstorming
* See Also

For more details on these and more, see:
* [[expand a page]]

=== Special Case Pages ===
In addition to the common structure across many pages, there are also several clusters or instances of special case pages.
==== Standards Pages ====
The wiki has pages for standards / specifications that were developed on the indieweb wiki, and have started or been formalized at [[W3C]], and thus their pages (and subpages) here have evolved in support of those specifications.

While these are rapidly evolving, take a look at:
* [[Webmention]]
* [[Micropub]]
* [[post type discovery]]

There are also pages that are about the indieweb usage of standards developed elsewhere or in active collaboration across communities, e.g. the pages for various [[microformats]]. Though these are generally structured in the common structure noted above, they may as a set have special patterns worth noting:
* [[h-entry]]
* [[h-card]]
* [[h-event]]
* [[h-review]]

(stub) - help expand this section with documentation of patterns across this type of special page.

==== Historical Pages ====
Some pages help document history, e.g.:
* [[history]]
* [[timeline]]
* [[site-deaths]]
* [[silo-quits]]

(stub) - help expand this section with documentation of patterns across this type of special page.

==== Cross-Generation Pages ====

As certain IndieWeb [[building-blocks]] become more widespread, folks from later [[generations]] could benefit from re-organized content. In some cases, it may be beneficial to break out "introductory" content (including high-level explanations, examples with screenshots, tools and services, ...) from "developer" content (such as protocol diagrams, code snippets, brainstorming, ...) For example:

* [[Webmention]] is an introduction page, with developer-specific content moved to [[Webmention-developer]].

(stub) - help expand this section with documentation of patterns across this type of special page.

The above is very much specific to what is good wikifying'' for IndieWeb in particular''.

Here are related articles on good writing, structure, and wikifying ''in general'':

== FAQ ==
=== Should this be on the wiki ===
Q: Do we really need this on the wiki?

A: Depends! In short, anything indieweb related is worth putting on the wiki, and sure it's up to someone to care enough to do it!

Here are some good examples of stuff to put on the wiki:
* Anything directly IndieWeb related, especially directly to people in the community with their own sites:
** Technologies (e.g. [[Apache]]) people are using to setup/build/run/maintain/monitor their indieweb site
** Services (e.g. [[web hosting]]) people are using with their indieweb site
** [[Events]] or [[podcasts]] that discuss the independent web or IndieWeb in particular, including events with only a single related talk (be sure to list the specific talk)
** [[jargon]] representing technology used as part of an IndieWeb site
** [[silos]] that have prior art ([[UX]], [[design]], [[formats]], [[protocols]]) for things we want to rebuild independently
*** also any silos where anyone has or is about to / expected to [[site-deaths|lose content, permalinks, online identities]].

=== What should not go on the wiki ===
Q: If all that makes sense on the wiki, what does not make sense on the wiki?

A: There are so many things that do not need to be on the wiki that it's hard to list them all. Obviously aside from stuff like [[code-of-conduct]] violations, here are a few which we've seen added then decided were better removed, that seem to fall into the pattern of when someone is passionate about something totally not indieweb related, and wants to add it to the wiki.

* Random stuff. In general, random things that lack an obvious IndieWeb connection are better left to [[Wikipedia]], and using Wikipedia links rather than creating less useful stub pages on the IndieWeb wiki. E.g.
** technical terms. If a technical term does not have a direct obvious connection to the IndieWeb, no need for it to be documented here
** organizations. If an organization has no relation to anything independent it can probably be left out.
*** Exception: As noted above as [[silos]], we are documenting any/all sites/services that anyone in the community has used (or even has friends that have used) that has announced or is threatening to [[site-deaths|shut down]], or has especially has [[UX]] that is worth capturing for prior art research purposes when designing our own indieweb features.
** events. If an event has nothing to do with the indieweb, it does not need to be listed on the [[Events]] page.

=== Do I have to use the wiki and mediawiki syntax? ===
While it's nice to put content into the wiki [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting using standard markup] for it, we realize not everyone is a wiki fan, knows how to do it, or even may have the time to learn to do it. (Documenting what you've done is both important and work enough.) 
* An alternate option is to simply practice the Indieweb [[principle]] of posting on your own site first where you have ultimate control. Then webmention "Indieweb" (for [[Superfeedr]]) or dump the link into [[discuss|chat]]. As long as you license your content as CC0 for that post, someone will surely add it to the wiki on your behalf.
* Users shouldn't feel guilty for adding content as best as they can (markup/formatting or not) where they feel it's appropriate. Others will come along and clean bits up in the near future. Nor should they hesitate to ask for help in [[discuss|chat]] if they'd like to learn more about wikifying.
