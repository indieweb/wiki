{{stub}}

'''<dfn>will.i.am problem</dfn>''' was the problem of false positives when auto-linking plain domains on ccTLDs, exemplified by mentions of the musician will.i.am (actual spelling) who did not own the "i.am" [[short-domain]] until recently, and the likely reason why Twitter still does not [[autolink]] ccTLD domains.

will.i.am bought or rents http://will.i.am/ from whoever owns i.am as of YYYY-MM-DD(date?).
