'''<dfn>www</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb is an unnecessary [[subdomain]] on personal [[domain name]]. "www." used to be expected as a convention for websites on a domain, but has long since been abandoned.

See:
* https://no-www.org/

On the other hand: the ''www'' subdomain can be useful when hosting a site on another provider's architecture ([[Withknown.com]], [[Google App Engine]], [[Heroku]], [[Amazon S3]], [[GitHub Pages]] or a [[CDN]]). To support a custom domain name and still provide load balancing, these services usually require a CNAME record pointing from your domain to a domain name they control. It used to be that you could not create a CNAME record for a naked domain, so www was a useful default, however this has not been the case for a while.

There was a "www" advocacy site setup at:
* <nowiki>http://www.yes-www.org/</nowiki> (Internet Archive needed)
but it was since lost and turned into some sort of spam site.
