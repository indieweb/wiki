The IndieWeb is a diverse, inclusive community of people from around the world with a broad range of skills and interests, united by the vision of an independent web. 

We welcome everyone to participate, contribute, and share ideas at [https://events.indieweb.org/ events], in [[discuss|chat]], and in the [[wikifying|IndieWeb wiki]]. Our [[code-of-conduct|code of conduct]] prioritizes respect and safety.

== Brainstorming ==
We need a proper "about" page that describes "who are the people behind this site, why are we here on this site in particular", with links to broader reasons [[why]] IndieWeb etc.
