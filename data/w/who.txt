<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>who</dfn>''' is the IndieWeb? We are [[community]] based on shared [[principles]], people using our personal websites for our online identity, content, and peer-to-peer interactions, actively collaborating & helping each other in [[discuss]]ions & [https://events.indieweb.org/ regular events], to advance the independent web, and provide onramps for people of all levels to join.</span>

== Brainstorming ==
We need a proper "about" page that describes "who are the people behind this site, why are we here on this site in particular", with links to broader reasons [[why]] IndieWeb etc.

== See Also ==
* [[community]]

* [[how]]
* [[founders]]

* Goal: a page we can link to from the top bar (including the [[Main_Page|home page]]) that newcomers would click to find out more about the people behind the site
* Possible link text for linking to this page: "who we are"
