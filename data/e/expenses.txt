<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Expenses</dfn>''' are both recurring and one-time costs incurred by admins and other folks to support shared IndieWeb resources (like hosting the IndieWeb community site) and events.</span>

Here's how to request to be reimbursed for an IndieWeb community expense: https://opencollective.com/faq#expense. The IndieWeb's collective page is https://opencollective.com/indieweb.

Historically, we documented expenses on this wiki page, although now we use our [[open collective]] page which better tracks donations and spending.
