{{stub}}

'''<dfn>e-summary</dfn>''' is a microformats2 class name for publishing a summary property typically as part of an [[h-entry]], and is one way to publish a partial content in-stream entry in a homepage [[h-feed]], while indicating to [[social reader]]s that they may retrieve the entire content at the entry permalink.

As an e- property, it indicates that it contains markup, as opposed to [[p-summary]] which is strictly plaintext.

== IndieWeb examples ==

* {{beesbuzz.biz}} uses <code>e-summary</code> from [[h-feed]] pages in order to indicate that there's additional content to be loaded at the actual [[h-entry]] URL.
