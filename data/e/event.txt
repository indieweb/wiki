<span style="float:right;height:128px;font-size:128px;margin-bottom:-64px">📅</span>
An '''<dfn>event</dfn>''' is a type of [[post]] that in addition to a post name (event title) has a start datetime (likely end datetime), and a location.

''For information on IndieWebCamp [[events]] themselves, see:''
* [[events]]

== Why ==
=== Why publish indie events ===
You should post events on your own site to own your events and so your friends with indieweb sites can directly [[RSVP]] to you (as well as post [[invitation]]s to others) without depending on a [[silo]] to mediate your event related interactions.
==== Why publish event microformats ====
In addition to enabling [[readers]] to display your events, and users to [[RSVP]] to them, publishing your events with [[h-event]] and classic hCalendar may cause them to show up and display in [[Google_Search#Google_Supports_Microformats|Google Search OneBox and Event Search]]:
[[Image:2019-151-google-search-onebox-microformats.png|320px]] [[Image:2019-151-google-event-search-microformats.png|320px]]
{{clear}}
=== Why POSSE events ===
You should [[POSSE]] copies of your events to the [[silos]] where your friends without their own indieweb sites keep track of their events and/or calendar.
__TOC__

== How to ==
=== How to markup ===
Event posts must be <span id="Marking up">marked up</span> with [[h-event]].

Example of an h-event with an embedded [[h-card]] for the [[p-location]]:
<pre style="line-height: 1.4em; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid #ddd; color: black; background-color: #f9f9f9; white-space: pre-wrap;">
&lt;div class="h-event"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a class="u-url p-name" href="https://indieweb.org/2017"&gt;IndieWeb Summit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;time class="dt-start" datetime="2017-06-24 09:30"&gt;June 24, 2017 9:30am&lt;/time&gt; to
  &lt;time class="dt-end" datetime="2017-06-25 18:00"&gt;June 25, 2017 6:00pm&lt;/time&gt; at
  &lt;span class="p-location h-card"&gt;
    &lt;a class="u-url p-name p-org" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozPDX"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, 
    &lt;span class="p-street-address"&gt;1120 NW Couch St #320&lt;/span&gt;, 
    &lt;span class="p-locality"&gt;Portland&lt;/span&gt;, 
    &lt;span class="p-region"&gt;Oregon&lt;/span&gt;, 
    &lt;span class="p-postal-code"&gt;97209&lt;/span&gt;, 
    &lt;abbr class="p-country-name" title="United States"&gt;US&lt;/abbr&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>


=== How to provide an RSVP UI ===
Event posts should have [[webaction]] buttons for RSVP actions and inviting others. E.g. some subset of:
<code>[ Going ][ Maybe ][ Interested ][ Can't Go ][ Ignore ][ Invite ]</code> perhaps based on private vs. public events, if you've already RSVPd, or relationship with the person.

See [[Facebook]]'s RSVP UI:
* http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp-examples#Facebook

=== How to accept RSVPs ===
A site publishing event posts '''should''' <span id="Accepting_RSVPs">accept</span> [[rsvp]] [[webmentions]] and update the event's attendance information accordingly.

See: http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp

=== How to accept invitations ===
A site publishing event posts '''should''' <span id="Accepting_Invitations">accept</span> [[invitation]] [[webmentions]] and update the event's "invited" information accordingly.

<!-- See: http://microformats.org/wiki/invitation -->

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In implementation order:
=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} uses [[idno]] on werd.io to post events since [http://werd.io/event/51c94deebed7de5c2386a1b4/unofficial-portland-post-indiewebcamp-meetup 2013-06-25] (right after IndieWebCamp [[2013]]!), which automatically accept RSVPs from other sites using [[RSVP]] webmentions. Events may also be [[comments|replied]] to in the same manner as notes and articles. E.g.
* index page of upcoming/recent events: http://werd.io/content/events
* http://werd.io/event/51c94deebed7de5c2386a1b4/unofficial-portland-post-indiewebcamp-meetup
* http://werd.io/2013/an-indieweb-catchup-over-food-and-drink (with example of explicit visible [[event#Invitations|invitations]])
* http://werd.io/2014/homebrew-website-club
** [[POSSE]] copy on [[Facebook]]: https://www.facebook.com/events/200590280142030/

As of 2017-06-14, Ben's event posts have a h-event as the top level item.

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com to post events since [http://aaronparecki.com/events/2013/07/09/1/speed-geeking-an-intro-to-oauth2 2013-07-08], which automatically accept RSVPs from other sites using [[RSVP]] webmentions. E.g.
* index page of recent events: http://aaronparecki.com/events
* http://aaronparecki.com/events/2013/07/09/1/speed-geeking-an-intro-to-oauth2
* http://aaronparecki.com/events/2014/01/29/1/homebrew-website-club
** [[POSSE]] copy on [[Facebook]]: https://www.facebook.com/events/1453049941575679/
* [[h-event]] as top-level microformat

=== Jeena ===
{{jeena}} has implemented events on his website because he wanted to host HWC:s and it wouldn't look good without the possibility to RSVP to a indie event. The event page receives RSVP:s and displays them under the event. Example:
*  https://jeena.net/events/2
* [[h-event]] as top-level microformat
* "download ics" grey italics .ics link

=== Ryan Barrett ===
[[User:snarfed.org|Ryan Barrett]] is manually posting events inside [[article]] posts on snarfed.org [https://snarfed.org/2014-01-15_homebrew-website-club-tonight since 2014-01-15]. Examples:
* https://snarfed.org/2014-06-16_homebrew-website-club-at-quip (includes native and [[backfeed]] [[rsvp]]s)
** Posted 2014-06-16, for an event on 2014-06-18
** POSSE FB event: https://www.facebook.com/events/675481332531191/
** Tweet about: https://twitter.com/schnarfed/status/478564735265157120
** <s>G+ post/linkshare about: https://plus.google.com/+RyanBarrett/posts/JwiJAfBNs9w</s>
** Tweets (and formerly G+ posts) worked as proxy POSSE posts for Bridgy [https://snarfed.org/2014-06-16_homebrew-website-club-at-quip#comments backfeed interactions] (favorites, retweets, +1s etc.)
* https://snarfed.org/2014-01-15_homebrew-website-club-tonight
** POSSE tweet: https://twitter.com/schnarfed/status/423586870144942080
* As of 2017-06-14, [[h-entry]] is the top-level microformat with [[h-event]] nested. This appears to be a limitation of [[WordPress]] themes that include h-entry around all posts / plugins that don't yet support event posts.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} added event posts (sans RSVP) on 2015-10-01. Example:
* http://gregorlove.com/2015/09/mew/
* [[h-feed]] of upcoming events: http://gregorlove.com/events/
* h-feed of past events: http://gregorlove.com/events/past/
* Immediate use-case is that I want to log all concerts I attend.
* [[h-event]] as top-level microformat
* "📅 Add to calendar" link to .ics

=== Shane Becker ===
{{veganstraightedge}} uses [[Dark Matter]] on veganstraightedge.com to post events since 2016-01-10] sans RSVPs. Back-dated events were added at that time. Examples:

* All events: http://veganstraightedge.com/events
* Single event: http://veganstraightedge.com/events/2013/11/02/farmhouse-conf-5-collapse
* [[h-event]] as top-level microformat

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} published / hosted an HWC event at his site on 2017-01-06. It shows received RSVPs in a [[facepile]].
* All events: https://seblog.nl/events
* Single event: https://seblog.nl/2017/01/11/1/homebrew-website-club
* [[h-event]] as top-level microformat

=== Calum Ryan ===
{{calumryan}} added event posts on 2016-06-15. Open to RSVP via same Webmention.io Jekyll Plugin that's present for all blog posts. Further work planned to possibly separate RSVP from other replies. 

UPDATE 2016-08-06 Since improved with separate events section modeled on Facebook events UI.

UPDATE 2019-01-23 Since added similar to HWC London website utilizing Webmention.io for RSVPs loaded through client-side only with a VueJs/axios script

* https://calumryan.com/event/hwc-20160824/
** [[h-event]] as top-level microformat
* https://calumryan.com/blog/homebrew-web-london/
** with name, datetime, location, start, time end
* https://hwclondon.co.uk/meetups/20171018
** with RSVPs, name, datetime, location, start, time end

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} added events support to [[Falcon]] on 2017-06-25 at [[2017|IndieWeb Summit 2017]]! Receives webmentions via webmention.io, still needs to process and display RSVPs etc.
* http://tantek.com/2017/179/e1/homebrew-website-club

** POSSE tweet copy: https://twitter.com/t/status/403064607373537280

More work to do: [[Falcon#event_posts]].

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} added events support to his site [https://martymcgui.re/2016/09/19/184924/ 2016-09-19] in preparation for hosting the first [[Baltimore|Baltimore Homebrew Website Club]] meeting.
* Receives webmentions via webmention.io. RSVPs for "going" and "maybe" are displayed as facepiles.
* [[h-event]] as top-level microformat
* Added support for [[featured]] image on [https://martymcgui.re/2016/10/12/004447/ 2016-10-12].
** POSSE tweet copy: https://twitter.com/schmarty/status/786067342899970052
** POSSE facebook copies are natively-created Facebook events.
* Uses [[Slater]] to posts events to his site.
* "📆 Add to Calendar: iCal | Google Calendar" links to .ics and to opening Google Calendar with a new event

=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{martijnvdven}} supports 2 separate methods for hosting indie events on his site:

# An <code>[[h-event]]</code> nested within <code>[[h-entry]]</code> was implemented and first used to host [https://licit.li/593fa571d6b80 an event post] for [[events/2017-06-14-homebrew-website-club#European_time|the 2017-06-14 virtual Homebrew Website Club]].
# Just an <code>[[h-event]]</code> was implemented later and first used to host [https://licit.li/596a1ac68a9b8 an event post] for [[events/2017-07-26-homebrew-website-club#Virtual_European_Time|the 2017-07-26 virtual Homebrew Website Club]].
#* This used the <code>e-description</code> property instead of <code>e-content</code> to match with [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-event the current (as of 2017-07-16) <code>h-event</code> spec].

The first method is officially deprecated as of 2017-07-15 when the second method became easy to do.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} began posting [http://stream.boffosocko.com/content/events/ events] to his stream 
website using the core functionality of [[Known]] to mark up with [[h-event]] on [http://stream.boffosocko.com/2015/the-indieweb-movement-and-drupal-1 2015-08-18]. 

With changes in the ability to properly receive facepile RSVPs in [[WordPress]] (including yes, no, maybe, and even invited) using the [[Wordpress_Webmention_Plugin|Webmention]] and [[Semantic Linkbacks]] plugins, on [http://boffosocko.com/2017/11/30/virtual-homebrew-website-club-meetup-on-december-13-2017/ 2017-11-30] he began manually marking up events with [[h-entry]] top level and secondary [[h-event]] markup (a limitation to his WordPress theme) and syndicating copies to silos including [[Facebook]], [[Meetup]], Google+, and [[Twitter]]. [[Bridgy]] currently allows [[backfeed|backfed]] responses from Twitter, and Google+, though only Facebook RSVPs backfeed properly as Facepiles. Hopefully future updates to the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] will automate/preformat some of the microformats markup. Additionally he uses the <code>u-featured</code> microformat to include a header image for events and has the ability to add an embedded map with geo-coordinates of the location of the event.

He's been posting [http://boffosocko.com/kind/RSVP/ RSVPs to his WordPress site] for some time as well, originally doing so manually, but later moving to using Post Kinds functionality when that became a simpler option.

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} has an [https://www.jvt.me/events/ /events/] page on his website, which is currently only populated for Homebrew Website Club Nottingham.

Jamie's set up also generates [https://www.jvt.me/events/homebrew-website-club-nottingham/2019/10/02/ iCalendar feeds for events] [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/05/22/ical-events-hugo/ since 2019-05-22], which allows interested people to add the event to their calendar, so they can see when the next one is more easily.

=== Former Examples ===
The following examples have been offline for some time — please update them with Internet Archive links if possible for historical purposes!

==== Bret Comnes ====
As of 2017-06-14 it appears {{bret}}'s old permalinks no longer work.

[[User:Bret.io|Bret Comnes]] has implemented events inside of [[jekyll]] for bret.io since [http://bret.io/2013/07/25/t1/ 2013-07-25]. It supports receiving webmentions, but does not parse responses for RSVP status or display reply contexts at the moment. Example:
*  http://bret.io/2013/07/25/t1/
*  (bad) Example of data https://raw.github.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/master/_posts/notes/2013-07-25-t1.md
The event data is stored in the YAML which separates the final layout and the event data.  A form is used to assist in creating the event post via [[prose.io]].

==== Kyle Mahan ====
{{kylewm}} added event posting with RSVPs to [[Red Wind]] on 2014-12-14. Example:
* https://kylewm.com/2014/12/homebrew-website-club-17-december-2014
* POSSE facebook copy: https://www.facebook.com/events/736605033092500/
* More recent event: https://kylewm.com/2015/04/homebrew-website-club-1
** has fixed the duplicate display of "is going" colored text vs. "is attending." default text summary from Bridgy (which the above 2014 example has)
* [[h-event]] as top-level microformat

=== IndieWeb Itches ===
The following people either strongly want to implement events on their site, or are in the process of doing so, you may find some implementation clues in their notes

==== Amy Guy ====
{{rhiaro}}: "events is my biggest itch currently"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-03-04/line/1425508438873]

Staged implementation[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-03-04#t1425508589730]
# I'm going to work with jarofgreen to get webmentions in opentechcalendar (since most events, at least ones I attend in scotland, are on there, and if they're not I can add them)
# then do all my events through that
# and [[rsvp]] from my site
# longer term hopefully we can get something working so I can post an event on my site initially
# POSSE (perhaps by sending a webmention) to opentechcalendar and have it create a public event copy

== Consuming Tools And Services ==
=== Quill ===
[[Quill]] (site/service, open source) parses for h-event in particular to:
* generate an event-aware [[reply-context]]
* whether to show the [[RSVP]] dropdown to enable posting a RSVP post!

=== IndieNews ===
[[IndieNews]] (site/service) parses for h-event differently from h-entry
* How? Why? Which Properties?

=== This Week ===
* The [[this-week]] newsletter (service, open source) generation code consumes h-event differently, specifically for:
* start/end date info (for determining recent and upcoming events)
* name/location - for display as such for an event
* photo - for display and POSSEing

=== mf2util ===
[[mf2util]] (open source python library) parses specifically for h-event vs h-entry to determine post type, and provides cleaned data to applications using it (timestamps get converted to Python types, locations are normalized, ...). An application using this is the IRC bot by {{sknebel}} that announces new Indieweb livestreams on #indieweb, which parses /events to determine on which days IWCs happen.

=== mf2 to iCalendar ===
[https://github.com/gRegorLove/mf2-to-iCalendar mf2-to-iCalendar] is a PHP library that converts [[h-event]] markup to [[iCalendar]].

== Brainstorming ==
As <span id="Design_Brainstorming">ideas</span> here are implemented, they should be moved to actual sections of their own with links to examples.

=== Image header ===
Typical [[silos]] event posts (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Google+]]) provide (encourage) the option of an event image - used as a header for the event. This header is used at the top of the event permalink page, and also often shown in an event list view (e.g. on [[Facebook]]).

Such header images are often quite a good visual/emotional draw for the event. Header images are typically representative of the event, sometimes displayed with the name of the event superimposed on top.

If you're posting events, consider providing this option for yourself (in your event posting UI or otherwise as part of your publishing system) as part of your indieweb event posts as well.

Since the photo would be deliberately chosen to represent the event, we could extend [[h-event]] to represent the photo as well with:
* <code>u-featured</code> (re-used from [[h-entry]]).

Note that <code>u-featured</code> is more appropriate for a header image than <code>u-photo</code>, since u-photo really should be used for photos of the event itself, taken at the event (We are now doing this with [[Homebrew Website Club]] photos, which gets them included in [[this-week]] in the IndieWeb).

'''Screenshots needed'''

=== Map image ===
Some [[silos]] event posts (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Plancast]]) automatically generate a horizontal rectangle map view of the event location.

In particular, on event posts, the location is shown *first* as a centered dot in a wide and short rectangle map that shows the local area, and then second underneath as text address.

Showing a map and showing it early is both visually striking and instantly provides a sense of "is this near me", or "is this near somewhere I'd like to be or might be anyway". It quickly gives you context in a way that a purely textual address does not.

'''Screenshots needed'''

A horizontal map (banner map?) from a Facebook event:

[[File:event-map-horizontal.jpg]]

=== Attendees ===
Event posts should display attendees, [[RSVP]]s in general, and [[invitation]]s.

There are two typical existing approaches to displaying RSVPs:
* clustered by state (yes, no, maybe) - current [[silos]] do this - see below
* in time order regardless of RSVP state

Clusters are typically displayed as [[facepiles]], either entirely, or abbreviated at some fixed number with a method to expand / view the whole set.

Time order presentation usually include some text about the RSVP, e.g. "is going", "is attending"

==== Silo Attendees ====
Every event silo by default shows who else is has [[RSVP]]ed that yes they're going, and more so, often first display who <em>you know</em> that's going to the event. Quickly seeing "who else is going" or might go or is invited is a huge sense of context/comfort as well, especially with little face icons.

E.g. Facebook clusters (potential) attendees by:
* Going
* Maybe
* Invited
(and declined is typically hidden)

'''More screenshots needed'''

Event attendees on Facebook:

[[File:event-attendees-facebook.png]]

Note the going/maybe/invited sections on FB first show *only* those you know (if any), and *only if* there's no one you know in a section, does the section show 5 icons of others who said they're going/maybe or were invited. In either case, the order of icons is most recently responded/invited first.

Public events don't necessarily have a public list of invited users, depending on the system, but nonetheless list attendees. For example, on Plancast:

[[File:public-event-plancast.jpg|300px]]

Plancast only shows invitees on an event to the event organizer, i.e. when the event organizer themselves is looking at the event permalink page.

=== Invitations ===
{{main|invitation}}
People like being explicitly invited to events. One way to send invitations with indieweb events is:
* Add people explicitly to an invited list on the event (present on the event page as noted above in Attendees) - with icon and name linked to their home page under a heading like "Invited:"
* Mark it up per [[invitation#Publish_an_invitation]]
* Send [[webmentions]] to their home page from the event permalink.

The idea is that a person's site's webmentions queue sees webmentions from the event to the home page and interprets that as an invitation to the event due to the special markup (u-invitee h-card) on the link to their site.
* See also [[indieweb messaging]], which also uses a webmention to the user's homepage.


RSVPs can also invite people (since you're going, you want to encourage other friends to go, especially those that have previously indicated interest)

<pre>
…
Join us! @benwerd @dietrich @generativist @html5cat @NurtureGirl @feross @maira et al
…
</pre>

Not sure what a good microsyntax is for recognizing invitations, maybe some key phrases at the start of a line like:
* "Hope to see you there"
* "Inviting "
* "You’re invited "
* "Join us! "
And then any @-names on that same line are invitees

=== Attending ===
Use-case: list people as attending e.g. in [[event#Tantek_POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSE tweet copies]] as a way to encourage them to post about the event, and to let invitees know who else is coming.

If you already know someone is attending your event (like they're a co-organizer or you know by other means), you could (should?) list them explicitly as attending.

* Add people you know are attending to a list on the event (present on the event page as noted above in Attendees) - with icon and name linked to their home page under a heading like "Attending:"
* Mark up each attendee with classes <code>u-attendee h-card</code> inside the <code>h-event</code> (or possibly also inside an <code>h-entry</code> for an RSVP!)
* Send [[webmentions]] to their home page from the event permalink as an FYI that you’ve noted that they're attending.

RSVP posts can also list who else is attending:

Examples, "With" listing attendees in an RSVP:
* https://tantek.com/2019/275/t1/indiewebcamp-new-york-city
* https://twitter.com/t/status/1169985579963961344
* https://twitter.com/t/status/1177855963186913280

Microsyntax: recognize " with @", then include all @-names until next sentence terminator(.!?) or newline.

=== POSSE ===
How and where should event posts be [[POSSE]]d?
* Related: [[RSVP#POSSE|RSVP: POSSE]]

Event-aware destinations to consider:
==== POSSE to Eventbrite ====
[[Eventbrite]] - has best API for creating events, getting updates, perhaps backfeeding attendees etc.
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/275 Bridgy feature request: publish Eventbrite events]
* Lots of people seem to use Eventbrite
* It seems to be good at getting people to show up to events - e.g. with reminders etc.
* Eventbrite also emails people when some number (2+?) of their friends are going to an event.

==== POSSE to Facebook ====
[[Facebook]] - likely has broadest reach of people you might want to explicitly invite. However, the [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.1/event#publish Facebook API disallows creating, updating, or deleting events]. Thus you have to POSSE events to Facebook manually:

* Create a '''manual POSSE event copy on FB''' of an event on your site
*# copy name, description, start/end time, and location if applicable.
*# re-use a [[featured]] image (if any) from your indie event (e.g. [https://snarfed.org/2014-06-16_homebrew-website-club-at-quip photo of French press coffee on this event]) as the FB event's "Event Photo"
*# Add your indie event URL to the FB event description, e.g.: <blockquote>Originally posted at: URL-TO-YOUR-INDIE-EVENT</blockquote>

* Support RSVPs from Facebook by setting up Bridgy to [[backfeed]] them for you
*# Support receiving [[RSVP]] Webmentions on your site
*# Support displaying [[RSVP]]s on your event posts
*# Authenticate [[Bridgy]] with Facebook at https://brid.gy/ (click the Facebook button)


RSVPs on the FB event will then send webmentions to your site via [[Bridgy]], and thus display people's FB RSVPs  *on the event on your site* E.g.
* '''{{aaronpk}}''' is posting events using [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com and manually POSSEing them to Facebook:

==== POSSE to Plancast ====
[[Plancast]] - event-specific silo

==== POSSE to Twitter ====
Despite not supporting event posts per se, [[Twitter]] is worth considering as a POSSE destination.

* Can we compress the details of an event post into 140 characters or less? (117 to leave room for event permalink URL, 116 for https).
* How do we abbreviate what/when/where "fields"? E.g. 
** What: summary... (ellipsed)
** Where: @-alias of venue (how do we do venue lookup on Twitter? Perhaps use [[Foursquare]] to lookup the venue and see if their venue entry has a Twitter for the venue?
** When: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (seems quite long, what's the best way to compress a datetime in a human readable way?)
** CC: @-names (of folks to explicitly notify, like an invitation)
* Should such fields be explicitly labeled e.g. with "What: / Where:" etc. with linebreaks between them?
* Or should we figure out a plain text event serialization format since things like an @-named venue already reads well "at venue"? (see [http://microformats.org/wiki/picoformats picoformats] for prior work/research on this)
* "featured" or map image -> tweet photo?
** Should an event post with a featured/header photo be POSSEd to Twitter as a tweet with a photo?
** Should an event post without a featured/header photo, but with a location, be POSSEd to Twitter as a tweet with a photo which is just a static rendered image of the map view of the venue / location?
** What is the "engagement" or "response rate" is on tweets/events with header photos vs. events without? *guessing* that with photos is much higher
* Where -> tweet location? Though tweet location is supposed to mean where the tweet was posted from, would it be too much of an abuse to stuff the event location into the tweet location?

=== Events index ===
Indieweb sites with event posts (and perhaps even just [[RSVP]] posts) could also provide an index of what events they're attending, e.g.
* at a /events URL

From a human [[design]] perspective this makes sense as:
* "these are the events I'll be at" 
which is likely a union of personal event posts and RSVP yes (and maybe maybes too?) posts.

Kind of like a view of your public calendar of events, regardless of whether you're organizing/hosting or just attending.

Such an events index could be displayed as a list view (similar to the default view of fb.com/events) or as a calendar view (like gCal), or with an option to toggle between them.

An easily-discoverable link should probably be displayed from the user's index or homepage.
* Potential for microformats or microformats-like markup to indicate a user's calendar as linked from their h-card?

=== Markup design ===
Markup for an h-event on a site must include a number of properties to enable presentation and user interaction as implied by some of the above brainstorming, and some of the better silo UX as documented in "Silo Examples"

The following fields/properties are necessary in the markup somewhere:
* <code>p-name</code>
** optional <code>u-featured</code> for an event background photo
* <code>dt-start</code> (likely in the future)
* <code>p-location</code> 
** with possible nested object <code>h-card</code> venue
*** with a map <code>u-url</code> - but how to identify it as a map URL?
*** with a map <code>u-photo</code> - but how to identify it as a map photo?
* <code>p-organizer</code> (reserved h-event property)
* <code>e-description</code> 
* <code>p-attendee</code> <code>h-card</code> for who is going
** not sure how to indicate RSVP status for each
* <code>p-x-responses h-feed</code> - event activity, e.g. <code>h-entry</code>s inside for:
** event creation, comments, when RSVPs were received

Markup example:
* TBD after a plain text design

=== Markup in feed file ===
[[feed file]]s (like Atom, RSS, JSONFeed) lack a way of expressing events as items, thus it makes sense to brainstorm how to do this in a manner that is both easy/simple for publishers, and hopefully reasonably implementable by consuming code (with good backcompat behavior).

One proposal is to use an embedded single [[h-event]] as the only child / value of the feed file "item" or "entry-content". E.g. 
* a single <code><nowiki><div class="h-event">…</div></nowiki></code> as the only child inside an Atom <code><content></code> element
* a single <code><nowiki><div class="h-event">…</div></nowiki></code> as escaped XML only child inside an RSS <code><item></code> element
* a single <code><nowiki><div class="h-event">…</div></nowiki></code> as escaped JSON entire value of a JSON feed item property
* …
(to be expanded based on brainstorming between {{t}} and {{manton}} in [[chat]] somewhere in the 2018 August archives)

Possible consuming code and user-cases:
* [[micro.blog]] syndication input being able to parse and support showing indie event posts from inside feed files, and perhaps offering [[micro.blog]] users the ability post [[RSVP]] posts in response to them (and sending Webmentions accordingly!)
* ...

Possible tangents:
* Use the event use case to help explore and possibly drive the possibility of other single <code><nowiki><div class="h-*">…</div></nowiki></code> handling inside feed file items as a common extension point to feed files without having to update separate feed file formats/syntaxes themselves, thus supporting a growing and extensible set of indieweb [[posts]] types (especially [[responses]]) across all of them
* ...

=== Cancelled ===
Sometimes you have to cancel an event, and indicate the event as cancelled on its permalink.

Gathering examples towards establishing best practices

IndieWeb examples:
* {{aaronpk}} 2017: https://aaronparecki.com/2017/12/06/1/hwcpdx
* {{t}} 2018: http://tantek.com/2018/360/e1/homebrew-website-club-sf

Facebook example:
* 2017-12-06 HWC PDX: https://www.facebook.com/events/352784491841109/

Some design aspects:
* "⚠️ This event was canceled" header before rest of event (t, fb)
* strike-through on the time and place
* permalink still works
* does not return 410 (cancelled != deleted)

iCalendar's VEVENT a "STATUS" property that has a "CANCELLED" value:
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8.1.11

Previously: What about when an event is cancelled? Options:
* Implement event cancellation as a [[delete]] and return 410, based on real world existing silo example:
** [[Facebook]] notifies you when an event you've indicated interest in has been cancelled, but then clicking that notification doesn't go anywhere - the event permalink itself just 404s.
** As of 2017 cancelled events are not deleted on FB.

=== Status ===
Events can have the notion of a "status", to indicate whether it is '''[[#Cancelled|cancelled]]''', or some other state.

Silo examples:
* [[Facebook]] events can be cancelled then have a "cancelled" status.
* [[Google Calendar]] events have a status that can be "Confirmed", "Tentative", "Cancelled". https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/update(per [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-12-27/1545869134116200 2018-12-27 dev chat])

IndieWeb examples:
* See '''[[#Cancelled|cancelled]]''' examples
* No other (non-normal, non-cancelled events known)

iCalendar's VEVENT a "STATUS" property that has similar values to Google Calendar (which likely got them from iCalendar)
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8.1.11

=== Response context CRUD ===
Similar to the general [[reply-context#CRUD|reply context: CRUD]] protocol, when an event changes (name, location, times, description, etc.) you should send webmentions to all the responses to the event that you've accepted, e.g. to all:
* [[RSVP]]s in response to your event
* [[invitation]]s to your event
* and all other generic responses like comments, likes, reposts

=== Calendar Reminders ===
{{main|Add to Calendar}}
Some event hosting silos, such as [[Eventbrite]] offer "[[Add to Calendar]]" functionality which allow users to add event reminders to the calendar system of their choice. Some example export options include [[ICS]] for standalone calendar software such as Apple Calendar or Microsoft Outlook and links that pre-populate the event creation form for web-based calendars such as [[Google Calendar]].

See also: [[Add_to_Calendar#IndieWeb_Examples|Add to Calendar: IndieWeb Examples]]

=== How to limit capacity ===
Some events have limited capacity and want to offer "tickets," ie only accept the first N RSVPs.

To do this, the site that hosts the canonical h-event should set the capacity. When it renders the event, it should show the space remaining based on its current number of <code>yes</code> [[rsvp]]s.

It should handle RSVP [[webmention]]s for the event in serial. When it gets a <code>yes</code> RSVP, it should check the capacity against the current number of yes RSVPs. If the event is full, it should reject the RSVP webmention. This could be done with either an explicit 403 Forbidden, or an implicit status like 203 Non-Authoritative Information or 304 Not Modified along with a human-readable message saying the event is full.

The host could also put overflow yes RSVPs on an ordered waiting list, mention that in the reject message, and automatically upgrade people on the waitlist when existing yes RSVPs are withdrawn.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Attending ===
{{main|Attending}}

Attending is a nice looking event silo that allows RSVPing via [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], and [[email]].

=== Lanyrd ===
[[Lanyrd]] was an [[event]] silo focused on conferences. It went down—[[site-deaths|presumed dead]]—in 2018-01.

=== Upcoming ===
[[Upcoming.org]] is a social [[event]] sharing [[silo]]. It was acquired and shutdown by [[Yahoo]], and later recreated by its original founder at its original domain name. The current version is open source on github at https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming-www.

=== Eventbrite ===

[[Eventbrite]] is another event silo. More details in [[#POSSE_to_Eventbrite]].

=== Meetup ===

[[Meetup]] is another event silo.

==== Redesign 2017 ====
In early 2017 Facebook redesigned their event page presentation, putting everything to do with the event itself in a single main/primary column in the middle, with a menu of calendar options on the left, and ads / related events on the right.

Event page:

[[File:2017-03-03-fb-event-ui-page.png|480]]

Single column specifics:

[[File:2017-03-03-fb-event-ui-main.png]]

==== Redesign 2015 ====
Sometime in 2015, Facebook redesigned their events presentation again, which in many ways seemed to regress even more, especially in the mobile web view:

[[File:2016-03-15-facebook-event-mobile-web-3.jpeg|500px]]<br/>

==== Redesign 2014-02-27 ====
Here is what the 2014-02-27 redesign (limited rollout as of that date, but subsequently broadly rolled out) looks like: 

[[File:Screen_Shot_2014-02-27_at_16.10.11.png|500px|Desktop]]

[[File:2014-03-03-fb-event-new-ios-web-ui-3.jpg|500px]]<br/>


Shall we count the design regressions?

# Global noise in the left column replaces the very relevant and easily skimmable who is going, maybe, invited lists of people
# Big blank area where there is no event header image
# Lots of visual noise from the gray background between the white blocks of text
# Missing the map overview graphic
# Less clear who is going/maybe/invited
# Lack of hierarchy (ordering) of going/maybe/invited removes subtle invitee incentive to upgrade from invited to maybe to going.
# ... more?

==== Before 2014-02-07 ====
This was perhaps the pinnacle of Facebook's event page design.

[[Facebook]] has had one of the more interesting/nicer/cleaner event page designs for quite some time.

Here is a screenshot of the [[events/2014-02-12-homebrew-website-club|2014-02-12 Homebrew Website Club]] event (for the SF location) on Facebook, manually POSSEd by [[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] from http://werd.io/2014/homebrew-website-club-meeting :

[[Google+]] shut down in 2019.
Until then, was another [[silo]] that has explicit event posts, but has enough challenges to be considered problematic:
