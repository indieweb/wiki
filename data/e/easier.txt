Making it '''<dfn>easier</dfn>''' to setup and use your own IndieWeb presence is a goal of the IndieWeb community, with minimum [[admintax|maintenance]], and helps us focus efforts on everything from providing more encouraging and accessible paths to [[getting started]], to making sure developer-centric approaches like [[SSG]]s are clearly documented as such, and in general improving the usability of the IndieWeb wiki itself (help [[wikify]] and garden).

But building the right onboarding experience may be more important than building the right tool.</blockquote>
