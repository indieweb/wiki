'''<dfn>environmental impact</dfn>''' is a summary [[page]] describing that person (or entity’s) effect on the environment, often with annual [[metrics]] sometimes as part of a broader [[annual report]], and or describing their daily (or recent) activities and practices that effect the environment, typically with an intent to reduce or minimize such effects.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Amy Guy ===
{{rhiaro}} has documented some of her practices to reduce and minimize personal environmental impact in her blog post:
* 2019-09-20 [https://rhiaro.co.uk/2019/09/reflections-climate Reflections prompted by #ClimateStrike]

== Corporate Examples ==
Some corporations publish their environmental impact statements on their website, sometimes called ”sustainability”. Alphabetical by name:
* [[Apple]]: https://www.apple.com/environment/
* [[Boeing]]: http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/index.page
* [[Facebook]]: https://sustainability.fb.com/
* [[Google]]: https://sustainability.google/
* [[Microsoft]]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability

== Posts About ==
* {{rhiaro}}’s [https://rhiaro.co.uk/tags/environmentposts posts about environmental impact] document her current practices and recommended practices for organizations.
* Erika Reinhardt's [https://erikareinhardt.com/personal-climate-action A Data-Driven Guide to Effective Personal Climate Action] has a lot of considerations and data on the impact of individual actions.

=== Tools ===
Possible tools for helping compute some aspects of your environmental impact:
* http://myfootprintcalculator.com/
** awaiting reports of IndieWeb Experience with this tool.
* [https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/questionnaire WWF Footprint calculator] - for the UK.
** Good: starts with diet as the first question! Meh: omits "pescetarian" option. Eating fish != "meat very rarely". The impacts of (different kinds of) fishing are very different from industrial meat production. Ironically the illustration for the diet question has a fish on a plate: <img src="https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/images/food-section.png" alt="cartoon graphic of a whole fish with visible tail with lemon slices on a plate" style="max-height:2em" />

** Focuses on transport, and unfortunately the more significant food (meat eating) and clothing impacts are buried in a mislabeled or at best misframed "[https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=7 Secondary carbon footprint calculator]".
* [http://ecopassenger.hafas.de Ecopassenger], by the International Railways Union UIC (Europe only)
** Sole focus on travel emissions, but one of the more advanced calculators with selection of specific trains, incl. modes of electricity generation etc.

=== Environmental impact of IndieWebCamp ===
Some organizations publish details on how they plan to reduce their collective impact on the environment and reduce their carbon footprint. Consider the environmental impact over all aspects of IndieWebCamps and other events at the planning stage. This could include:
==== Venue and travel ====
* Is the venue in a city with good public transport links? 
* Can the majority of attendees travel there easily and affordably by public transport without flying?
* Does the event page inform attendees on how to get there without flying or driving?
* Are there recycling options at the venue?
* Does the venue use energy efficiently?
==== Timing ====
* Are there other conferences/events on adjacent dates to IndieWebCamps that attendees maybe able to combine as part of their visit to reduce travel?
==== Equipment and stationery ====
* Are name tags and other materials such as signage and "sticky" notes reusable?
==== Catering ====
* What meal options are there, if any, e.g vegetarian / vegan?
* If provided, are napkins, plates, cups and cutlery reusable or biodegradable?
==== Remote participation ====
* Is remote participation available, is it reliable and fully accessible to latest [[WCAG]] standards?
* Remote participation can help to mitigate the environmental impact of events for attendees wanting to participate from other countries, regions or states.
==== Communication and data collection ====
* Are attendees and co-organizers fully aware of environmental impact consideration both before and during events?
* Consider surveying at each event how people have travelled there.
