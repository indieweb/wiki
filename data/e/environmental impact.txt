=== Tools ===
Possible tools for helping compute some aspects of your environmental impact:
* http://myfootprintcalculator.com/
** awaiting reports of IndieWeb Experience with this tool.
* [https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/questionnaire WWF Footprint calculator] - for the UK.
** Good: starts with diet as the first question! Meh: omits "pescetarian" option. Eating fish != "meat very rarely". The impacts of (different kinds of) fishing are very different from industrial meat production. Ironically the illustration for the diet question has a fish on a plate: <img src="https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/images/food-section.png" alt="cartoon graphic of a whole fish with visible tail with lemon slices on a plate" style="max-height:2em" />

** Focuses on transport, and unfortunately the more significant food (meat eating) and clothing impacts are buried in a mislabeled or at best misframed "[https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=7 Secondary carbon footprint calculator]".

** Sole focus on travel emissions, but one of the more advanced calculators with selection of specific trains, incl. modes of electricity generation etc.
