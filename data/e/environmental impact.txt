'''<dfn>environmental impact</dfn>''' is a summary [[page]] describing that person (or entity’s) effect on the environment, often with annual [[metrics]] sometimes as part of a broader [[annual report]], and or describing their daily (or recent) activities and practices that effect the environment, typically with an intent to reduce or minimize such effects.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Amy Guy ===
{{rhiaro}} has documented some of her practices to reduce and minimize personal environmental impact in her blog post:
* 2019-09-20 [https://rhiaro.co.uk/2019/09/reflections-climate Reflections prompted by #ClimateStrike]

== Corporate Examples ==
Some corporations publish their environmental impact statements on their website, sometimes called ”sustainability”. Alphabetical by name:
* [[Apple]]: https://www.apple.com/environment/
* [[Boeing]]: http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/index.page
* [[Facebook]]: https://sustainability.fb.com/
* [[Google]]: https://sustainability.google/
* [[Microsoft]]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability

== Posts About ==
* {{rhiaro}}’s [https://rhiaro.co.uk/tags/environmentposts posts about environmental impact] document her current practices and recommended practices for organizations.
* Erika Reinhardt's [https://erikareinhardt.com/personal-climate-action A Data-Driven Guide to Effective Personal Climate Action] has a lot of considerations and data on the impact of individual actions.

=== Tools ===
Possible tools for helping compute some aspects of your environmental impact:
* http://myfootprintcalculator.com/
** awaiting reports of IndieWeb Experience with this tool.
* [https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/questionnaire WWF Footprint calculator] - for the UK.
** Good: starts with diet as the first question! Meh: omits "pescetarian" option. Eating fish != "meat very rarely". The impacts of (different kinds of) fishing are very different from industrial meat production. Ironically the illustration for the diet question has a fish on a plate: <img src="https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/images/food-section.png" alt="cartoon graphic of a whole fish with visible tail with lemon slices on a plate" style="max-height:2em" />

** Focuses on transport, and unfortunately the more significant food (meat eating) and clothing impacts are buried in a mislabeled or at best misframed "[https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=7 Secondary carbon footprint calculator]".

** Sole focus on travel emissions, but one of the more advanced calculators with selection of specific trains, incl. modes of electricity generation etc.
