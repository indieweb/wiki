An '''<dfn>edit</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>diff</dfn>, <dfn>change</dfn>) is a special type of [[reply]] that indicates a set of suggested changes to the [[post]] it is replying to. A [[collection]] of (presumably related) suggested edits in open source is often called a <dfn>patch</dfn> or <dfn>pull request</dfn>.

== Why ==
Reasons why you should publish edit posts, and support having a [[reader]] show them. Each of these are use-cases of their own merit.

=== Own Your Edits ===
__TOC__
'''Why post your own edits'''

E.g. edit a Wikipedia page by posting an edit on your own site, and notifying the original.

# Find a [[Wikipedia]] page you want to edit
# Make a local copy on your own site
# Edit it on your own site
# Publish an edit post on your own site
# Notify the original page about your edit response by sending a [[webmention]] to [[Wikipedia]].
# Wikipedia verifies the webmention and accepts the edit as being authored by your personal domain, like the User: domain accounts we already have here on IndieWebCamp (e.g. [[User:Tantek.com]]).

This is very similar to the existing git model of making a pull request from your own fork of a repository, and having that pull request automatically accepted because a repo policy.

==== Federated IndieWebCamp Edits ====
While the above user scenario with Wikipedia is <em>hypothetical</em> and would require Wikipedia and thus MediaWiki to support receiving webmentions from edit posts, and understanding IndieWeb [[identity]], there is something we can do first to prove it can work.

We can implement this scenario on IndieWebCamp's MediaWiki installation first:

# Find a IndieWeb.org page you want to edit
# Make a local copy on your own site of the wiki source, and make a note of the permalink of specific version of the page (and section if you're only editing that)
# Edit the wiki source on your own site
# Publish an edit post on your own site with
#* the wiki source as <code>e-content</code>
#** (might have to use <code>p-content</code> with anything resembling markup escaped instead of <code>e-content</code> so the edit post doesn't look weird on your own site. so more like a special [[note]] with whitespace preserved than a special [[article]])
#* a <code>u-edit-of</code> hyperlink to the version of the page you're editing.
# Notify the original page about your edit response by sending a [[webmention]] to IndieWeb.org (which already supports receiving webmentions, just doesn't do anything with them other than share with Loqi thus to IRC).
# IndieWeb.org verifies the webmention and accepts the edit as being authored by your personal domain, like the User: domain accounts we already have here on IndieWebCamp

And presto, you can edit IndieWeb.org without ever logging into it.

=== Quick typo fixes from friends ===
'''Why support receiving edits from others to your posts?'''

If someone you know and trust to edit your posts sends you an edit reply to your post, it would be nice to be able to automatically (or semi-automatically with a single "Accept" button click) to have those edits incorporated into your post, and somehow cite the edit post as having contributed.

This would require that the edit operations themselves (insertions, deletions, replacements) be explicitly marked up in a way that was automatically machine processable.

=== View Edits From Elsewhere ===
'''Why show edit posts in your reader?'''

By implementing the consumption and display of edit posts in your [[reader]], you can view edits made by your account on another site, or edits to a particular page, or even all edits to a wiki.

E.g. if third party wiki [[commons]] (like Wikipedia) supported marking up their edit permalinks as edit posts, and in their streams of edits as well, it would be possible to follow/subscribe to them in an indie [[reader]] and see your edits on another site show up in the stream of posts in your reader.

=== Lightweight Pull Request ===
'''Why publish edits you would otherwise publish elsewhere?'''

The idea was [https://chat.indieweb.org/2014-11-17#t1416259705874000 discussed] regarding the posting of git/code diffs in a [[post]] as a way to create a lightweight pull request.  The post could contain [[action]] tags to trigger some kind of diff handler to open and inspect diff in the correct repo using git.

A Pull Request could be a published as:
* [[collection]] of [[edit]] posts.

=== Special Edit Posts ===
There are a few edit posts that are special enough (i.e. how they are typically presented, and the UI for creating / interacting with them) to be worth discussing separately:
* [[tag-reply]] - adding tags or [[person-tag]]s to posts (typically others's posts, or your old posts)
* [[location-of]] - adding a location to a post (in particular others's posts, but could also be explicit additions to your own posts after the fact)

== How ==
We haven't quite figured out the "how" of a good way to markup edit posts.

A good start seems to be to write an "edit" like a [[reply]], but with <code>class="u-edit-of"</code> instead of <code>class="u-in-reply-to"</code>

The details of how to markup the diffs (deletions, insertions, replacements) of an edit are still being figured out.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} has posted an edit post on 2015-02-02:
* https://kylewm.com/2015/02/edit-of-a-href-http-tantek-com-2015-033-t1-disable which uses:
** "u-edit-of" on a link to the original
** "e-diff" - presumably instead of "e-content"
** other classes like "gu" (range of edit?), "gd" (deletion), "gi" (insertion)

== Open Source Examples ==
=== MediaWiki ===
[[MediaWiki]], e.g. like on this wiki, has permalinks of individual edits:
* https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=edit&diff=prev&oldid=12023
As well multiple places where streams of edit summaries are displayed:
* Changes across the whole wiki: [[Special:RecentChanges]]
* History of a particular page: https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=edit&action=history
* Contributions from a user: https://indieweb.org/Special:Contributions/Tantek.com

== Commons Examples ==
=== Wikipedia ===
[[Wikipedia]], an openly licensed [[commons]], being the biggest deployment of [[MediaWiki]], effectively has permalinks to <dfn>diffs</dfn> which show all the changes made in an edit. E.g.:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Webmention&diff=615221236&oldid=615219824

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
On [[Facebook]], edit posts can be some of the most popular posts, e.g. 
* updated profile photo (perhaps most common)
* changed relationship status to engaged to (person name)
* changed relationship status to married to (person name)
(specific permalinks needed)

In each of these cases, such posts typically generate numerous [[responses]] (e.g. [[likes]] and [[comments]]), far more than the average on that person's other posts.

Facebook also allows others to suggest changes to your profiles e.g.:
* Suggested your city is (city name)

==== Facebook Events ====
(stub - this section could use expansion and broader coverage)

While the [[create#Facebook_Events|create event]] UI lacks an option to select an existing photo, after the event has been created there is a button at the top right "Change Event Photo" which drops down several options, including "Choose from My Photos" and "Choose from Event Photos"

[[File:Facebook-edit-event-2016-03-07.png]]

(needs screenshot of the screen/dialog like the [[create#Facebook_Events]] screenshot)

...

===== Facebook Event Restrictions =====
Facebook has some event editing restrictions, including in particular capitals and punctuation in the event name, e.g.:

[[File:2016-06-03-facebook-event-rename-error.png|700px]]

<blockquote>Event names need to use standard capitalization and can't make excessive use of special characters.</blockquote>

Note also the "Suggested name:" below the field.

Obviously no such restrictions exist on the IndieWeb.

You can name your indie events whatever you want.

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]], a [[silo]], has permalinks to <dfn>pull requests</dfn> which are a collection of commits, or edit posts. E.g.:
* https://github.com/kevinmarks/kevin-marks.com/pull/1/files
as well as permalinks to individual commits (edit posts)
* https://github.com/aaronpk/p3k-core/commit/78aea731f5bb2564cffe155c9ac9591ccc43cef4

=== ThinkUp ===
[[ThinkUp]], a tool that monitors [[twitter]] and [[facebook]] posts edits to people's biographies as coloured diffs. E.g.:
* https://kevinmarks.thinkup.com/?u=kevinmarks&n=twitter&d=2015-05-25&s=bio_tracker
* https://kevinmarks.thinkup.com/?u=kevinmarks&n=twitter&d=2015-05-11&s=bio_tracker

== Brainstorming ==
=== Edit a specific property ===
Thoughts on how to publish an edit of a specific property.

Below is an example of updating a photo property of an h-card as discussed [https://chat.indieweb.org/2015-05-27#t1432750574351000 on IRC 2015-05-27] and [https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/f598be72d7bad1a04eb5 iterated on github].

Consumers of this post must act only on non-empty property values on the object embedded on the "p-update" property.

<pre><div class="h-entry">
  <a href="http://aaronparecki.com" class="u-author h-card">Aaron Parecki</a> updated 
  <a href="http://aaronparecki.com" class="u-edit-of">his</a> profile photo
  <div class="p-update h-card">
    <img src="http://example.com/photo2.jpg" class="u-photo">

Similar to <code>p-update</code>
* <code>p-delete</code> with embedded object with a property, or specific value of a property, indicating deletion granularity
* <code>p-add</code> with embedded object with property with a value to add

=== reuse structure from Micropub? ===
Micropub has edits, maybe that structure could be adapted? (With the benefit that accepting an edit could be a straight-forward translation of a proposed edit to an MP-request). 

=== [[fragmention]] ===
A very basic option (e.g. to propose a spelling correction) could be a fragmention for content selection and just the proposed replacement text.
