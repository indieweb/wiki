{{stub}}

You can '''<dfn>expand a page</dfn>''' that someone has [[start a page|started]] by expanding the definition, adding one or more new sections, or add to an existing section.

== Definition Improvement ==
* expand (and/or simplify) a definition to '''[[wikifying#Definitions_include_indieweb_relevance|include the IndieWeb relevance]]''' of the term and please minimize use of [[jargon]] (at link it if you must include it).

== Audiences ==
The top of a page should be simple, direct, and consider the audiences that are new the IndieWeb.

Beyond that, a page and its sections noted above should be easy so understand and use by new indieweb users, [[WordPress]] site users, and developers.

To better understand these audiences and needs, consider:
* Does the page make sense to an indieweb user and help them understand why something matters? 
* Does the page make sense to someone using WordPress and how they can improve their blog?
* Does the page make sense to developers and provide a quickly understandable reason why they should care and how to implement it with examples including screenshots?

== Section Expansions ==
Most pages could use expansion of their existing sections.
* adding IndieWeb Examples - if you find a page for a technology you support on your site, or a project you use on your site, add yourself to the "IndieWeb Examples" for that page
* add issues and questions (for FAQs)
* collect questions/answers from [[discuss|chat]] and add them to the appropriate wiki page

== Common Sections ==
Most pages have (or could use) sections like the following (in this order)
* definition
* Why
* How to
* IndieWeb Examples
* Silo Examples
* Brainstorming
* FAQ
* See Also

Pages about silos, other services, and software projects sometimes have:
* Features
* IndieWeb Friendly (support, compatibility, best practices etc.)

== Stub Sections ==
Do not add empty sections. If you have surfficient experience (and have asked in a channel for input), you may add stub sections that indicate there is "No known reason why" or "Unknown how to" or "How to still being figured out per brainstorming" etc.

== Reorganizing Into Sections ==
Pages often have raw (paragraphs of text) content. Try to organize the existing content of a growing page into the above common sections as needed.

* [[wikify]]
* [[start a page]]
