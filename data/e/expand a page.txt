{{stub}}

You can '''<dfn>expand a page</dfn>''' that someone has [[start a page|started]] by expanding the definition, adding one or more new sections, or add to an existing section.

== Common Sections ==
Most pages have (or could use) sections like the following (in this order)
* Why
* How to
* IndieWeb Examples
* Silo Examples
* Brainstorming
* FAQ
* See Also

Pages about silos, other services, and software projects sometimes have:
* Features
* IndieWeb Friendly (support, compatibility, best practices etc.)

== Audiences ==
The top of a page should be simple, direct, and consider the audiences that are new the IndieWeb.

Beyond that, a page and its sections noted above should be easy so understand and use by new indieweb users, [[WordPress]] site users, and developers.

To better understand these audiences and needs, consider:
* Does the page make sense to an indieweb user and help them understand why something matters? 
* Does the page make sense to someone using WordPress and how they can improve their blog?
* Does the page make sense to developers and provide a quickly understandable reason why they should care and how to implement it with examples including screenshots?

* [[wikify]]
* [[start a page]]
