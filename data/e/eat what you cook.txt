'''<dfn>eat what you cook</dfn>''' (or <dfn>eating what you cook</dfn>, or <dfn>eating your own cooking</dfn>) is a metaphor for the IndieWeb [[principle]] ‚Äú[[use what you make]]‚Äù, encouraging [[creators]] to consume what they create, in particular on their personal website, and a more palatable replacement for the [[selfdogfood]] metaphor.

On the IndieWeb, ‚Äúeat what you cook‚Äù means using your creations on your <em>personal site</em> as an aspect of your <em>primary online identity</em>, day to day.

== eating what they cook ==
Use ‚Äú'''eating what they cook'''‚Äù instead of ‚Äúselfdogfooding‚Äù to describe creators using their creations. In the past, we have described users of [[projects]] or [[services]] they created as "[[selfdogfooding]]". If you find such uses on pages, replace them with a link to <code><nowiki>[[eating what they cook]]</nowiki></code>.

=== Taste your own cooking ===
The metaphor ‚Äùtaste your own cooking‚Äù is something you can do both as part of creating something, and with the finished result, before committing to eating it (why would you eat it if it tasted bad).

The word "taste" also alliterates well with "test", and serves as a good reminder to test your work-in-progress, as a chef might taste the dishes while they are preparing them to see what changes they might need.

== History ==
"Eat what you cook" was deliberately chosen by the community among a few proposals to supersede [[selfdogfooding]] due to [[dogfood#Criticism|various problematic aspects of dogfood as a metaphor]].
