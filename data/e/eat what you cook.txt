{{stub}}

'''<dfn>eat what you cook</dfn>''' is a metaphor for making use of what you create on and for the [[IndieWeb]], especially any code you write, and one of several IndieWeb community [[principles]]. It was deliberately chosen among a few alternatives by the community to supersede [[selfdogfooding]] due to [[dogfood#Criticism|various problematic aspects of dogfood as a metaphor]].
