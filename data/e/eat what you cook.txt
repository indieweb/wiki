'''<dfn>eat what you cook</dfn>''' is a metaphor for the IndieWeb [[principle]] ‚Äú[[use what you make]]‚Äù, encouraging [[creators]] to consume what they create, in particular on their personal website, and a more palatable replacement for the [[selfdogfooding]] metaphor.

On the IndieWeb, ‚Äúeat what you cook‚Äù means using your creations on your <em>personal site</em> as an aspect of your <em>primary online identity</em>, day to day.

[‚Ä¶] This messaging app I built for, and with, my family, it won‚Äôt change unless we want it to change. There will be no sudden redesign, no flood of ads, no pivot to chase a userbase inscrutable to us. It might go away at some point, but that will be our decision. What is this feeling? Independence? Security? Sovereignty?"

"Eat what you cook" was deliberately chosen by the community among a few proposals to supersede [[selfdogfooding]] due to [[dogfood#Criticism|various problematic aspects of dogfood as a metaphor]].
