{{stub}}

'''<dfn>eat what you cook</dfn>''' is a metaphor for making use of what you create on and for the [[IndieWeb]], especially any code you write, and one of several IndieWeb community [[principles]]. It was deliberately chosen among a few alternatives by the community to supersede [[selfdogfooding]] due to [[dogfood#Criticism|various problematic aspects of dogfood as a metaphor]].

Beyond using your creations, there is also an aspect of depending on them personally yourself, beyond just self-testing a work project. 

On the IndieWeb, it means using your creations on your <em>personal site</em> as an aspect of your <em>primary online identity</em>, day to day.

== Why ==
'''Get started faster. What do you really need?''' When you eat what you cook, you better understand what you really need rather than just what you think you need.
* By building what you need, it constrains what you think you need with the practical limits of time, ability, and cost, thus forcing you to come up with a more efficient design than you likely thought you needed originally.

'''Prioritization. Fix more important problems first'''. When you eat what you cook, you empathize as a user and fix the important problems first.
* By using what you build, you see and feel the impact of problems in what you have built, and in particular feel the difference between minor problems and major problems, thus helping you prioritize fixing the more important problems.

'''Faster iteration. Fix the more important problems faster'''. Eating what you cook helps motivate you to fix the important problems faster.
* By using what you build as your personal identity on the public web, when there are visible problems, you will feel self-conscious about it, and strongly motivated to fix them quickly.

'''If you don't build it, you're just talking theory.'''
* If you design/architect etc. without building, you'll likely come up with ever higher level abstractions, AKA the [[architecture astronomy]] anti-pattern. That being said, it's helpful to publicly brainstorm what you're thinking of building because others can review, provide feedback, help you simplify, etc.

'''If not you, then who? [should bother using your stuff]'''
* If you're not willing to use your creation on your own primary personal website, why should anyone else use it on their primary personal website?

'''Creations tend to break (stay broken), when their creators don't use them.'''
* In general it is a good idea to use code that the author is using themselves. Those are less likely to be broken.

== How to ==
__TOC__
Eating what you cook, has several required components, <em>one</em> of which is actually eating (using the thing), but the other is the essential '''you cook''' part of eat what you cook:
# '''active creation''' - whether code, UX, interactive/visual/graphic design, being an active [[creator]]
# '''use of''' what you create (e.g. by your company, on your company's site, your club's site, etc.)
# '''personal''' - use of that creation - you yourself <em>personally</em> using your creation for your own personal uses - it's not (just) a job use (i.e. that you can shut off when you go home), it's a personal use.
# '''identity''' - use of that creation in what you identify as your <em>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_self self]</em>. The act of creation alters an aspect of the public "self" of the creator. On the web, this means use of that creation actively on your personal website that you primarily use to identify yourself to others. I.e. not on a test site, nor a hobby site, nor an occasional use site, but your ''primary'' personal site and thus as part of your '''primary identity''' on the web.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In rough order of when IndieWeb community members started eating their own cooking of at least some part of what they build, using their own primary web identity presence with their own domain.
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} eats his own cooking with his personal publishing software [[Falcon]], including its open source functions in [[CASSIS]] live on his own site [http://tantek.com/ tantek.com] since 2010-01-01.
* He often deploys and tests [[CASSIS]] updates on his own site as a final live test before committing them to the cassis github repo, figuring if its going to break in production, he'd rather it break first on his site, than someone else's site who is depending on CASSIS.
 
=== Kartik Prabhu ===
{{kartikprabhu}} eats his own cooking with his website code [[Bundle]] on his site [https://kartikprabhu.com kartikprabhu.com] since sometime in 2013

=== Dmitri Shuralyov ===
{{ds}} eats his own cooking with his [https://github.com/shurcooL/issuesapp issue tracker] on his personal website.
He uses it as the [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/issues/github.com/shurcooL/issuesapp?state=all canonical issue tracker] for the issue tracker itself, as well as to drive his [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/blog blog] ([https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/blog?issuesapp=1 source]), and a list of [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/idiomatic-go idiomatic Go] suggestions ([https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/idiomatic-go/entries source]).

=== capjamesg ===

{{jamesgoca}} eats his own cooking by:

* Using a [[webmention]] endpoint he built to accept all incoming webmentions.
* Using his [[Micropub]] client to post content to his site.
* Using the [[IndieWeb Search]] engine he is building to answer questions he has about the IndieWeb.

He also eats his own cooking with his [https://github.com/shurcooL/notificationsapp notification tracker], using it on his personal site to read all his [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/notifications notifications]. Notifications come from GitHub and additional sources.

* Beware of this trap: "only the people who wrote it can reliably use it" that OpenID fell into per twitter.com/elforesto/status/976177015958261762

* I have a higher tolerance for my own stupidly designed interfaces than <nowiki>[another person]</nowiki> would, but at some point I'm going to get frustrated by inefficiencies in my interface and make it better for me, which then makes it better for everyone. - [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] ([http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-08-21/line/1377127086 2013-08-21 in IRC])

* " And this is why we (here) have the principle / pressure of eat what you cook, because it focuses on the need (to eat!) rather than the process of spending hours cooking, and never eating" from tantek in chat (https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-09-16#t1631815786178300).

** capjamesg responded: That's the reason I came to the IndieWeb. I have never felt I had to do anything from scratch to particulate [sic]. And so I felt a whole lot more welcomed!"
