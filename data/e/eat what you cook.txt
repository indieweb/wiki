'''<dfn>eat what you cook</dfn>''' is a metaphor for the IndieWeb [[principle]] “[[use what you make]]”, encouraging [[creators]] to consume what they create, in particular on their personal website, and a more palatable replacement for the [[selfdogfooding]] metaphor.

On the IndieWeb, “eat what you cook” means using your creations on your <em>personal site</em> as an aspect of your <em>primary online identity</em>, day to day.

* " And this is why we (here) have the principle / pressure of eat what you cook, because it focuses on the need (to eat!) rather than the process of spending hours cooking, and never eating" from tantek in chat (https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-09-16#t1631815786178300).

[…] This messaging app I built for, and with, my family, it won’t change unless we want it to change. There will be no sudden redesign, no flood of ads, no pivot to chase a userbase inscrutable to us. It might go away at some point, but that will be our decision. What is this feeling? Independence? Security? Sovereignty?"

=== Taste your own cooking ===
The metaphor ”taste your own cooking” is something you can do both as part of creating something, and with the finished result, before committing to eating it (why would you eat it if it tasted bad).

The word "taste" also alliterates well with "test", and serves as a good reminder to test your work-in-progress, as a chef might taste the dishes while they are preparing them to see what changes they might need.

== History ==
"Eat what you cook" was deliberately chosen by the community among a few proposals to supersede [[selfdogfooding]] due to [[dogfood#Criticism|various problematic aspects of dogfood as a metaphor]].
