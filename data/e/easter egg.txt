{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>easter egg</dfn>''' is an (often small) undocumented feature, many are small jokes, in software or services, including on a few IndieWeb sites.

== Why ==
Because it‚Äôs [[fun]]. [[principle]] 11.

== Konami Code ==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code Konami Code] is a cheat code originating from 80s Konami video games, these days used as reference, or as an actual, functioning Easter egg on websites: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a. 

This is vanilla JS, no framework is needed.

<pre>function kcl(cb) {
  var input = '';
  var key = '38384040373937396665';
  document.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
    input += ("" + e.keyCode);
    if (input === key) {
      return cb();
    }
    if (!key.indexOf(input)) return;
    input = ("" + e.keyCode);
  });
}

kcl(function () {
    // do something here
})</pre>

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} has a rotating set of messages on his homepage that change on refresh. These messages appear above his sparkline. Examples as of 2023-02-10 include:

* "Amateur fruit connoisseur."

* "Perpetually curious."

==== Previously ====

{{capjamesg}}'s website used to have a custom Konami code activated using the following sequence:

* Up
* Down
* Up
* Down
* Up
* Down

The Konami code triggers a change in the HTML inside an announcement banner that is used to show featured posts on his blog. The announcement banner appears on all pages.

Visitors can press the escape key to reset the Konami code if they make a mistake when tying it in or if they have already pressed other keys before trying the code.

The code that powers his Konami code is based on the first example:

<pre>
function konami() {
    var input = "";
    var code = "384038403840";
    document.addEventListener("keydown", function(e) {
        if (e.keyCode.toString() === "27") {
            input = "";
        } else {
            input += e.keyCode.toString();
            if (input === code) {
                const announcement = document.getElementsByClassName("announcement")[0];
                announcement.innerHTML = "<p style='color:white;'><b>You have found the secret.</b></p>"
            }
        }
    })
}
