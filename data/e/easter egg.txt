An '''<dfn>easter egg</dfn>''' is an (often small) undocumented feature, many are small jokes.

== Konami Code ==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code Konami Code] is a cheat code originating from 80s Konami video games, these days used as reference, or as an actual, functioning Easter egg on websites: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a. 

This is vanilla JS, no framework is needed.

<pre>function kcl(cb) {
  var input = '';
  var key = '38384040373937396665';
  document.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
    input += ("" + e.keyCode);
    if (input === key) {
      return cb();
    }
    if (!key.indexOf(input)) return;
    input = ("" + e.keyCode);
  });
}

kcl(function () {
    // do something here
})</pre>

{{fluffy}}'s [https://beesbuzz.biz/ site] has quite a few animated error pages, complete with theme songs. Try to generate a 403, 404, or 4xx error yourself. (If you give up, here are [https://beesbuzz.biz/music/experiments/2314-error-pages spoilers].)

=== capjamesg ===

{{jamesgoca}}'s website has a custom Konami code activated using the following sequence:

* Up
* Down
* Up
* Down
* Up
* Down

The Konami code triggers a change in the HTML inside an announcement banner that is used to show featured posts on his blog. The announcement banner appears on all pages.

Visitors can press the escape key to reset the Konami code if they make a mistake when tying it in or if they have already pressed other keys before trying the code.

The code that powers his Konami code is based on the first example:

<pre>
function konami() {
    var input = "";
    var code = "384038403840";
    document.addEventListener("keydown", function(e) {
        if (e.keyCode.toString() === "27") {
            input = "";
        } else {
            input += e.keyCode.toString();
            if (input === code) {
                const announcement = document.getElementsByClassName("announcement")[0];
                announcement.innerHTML = "<p style='color:white;'><b>You have found the secret.</b></p>"
            }
        }
    })
}

konami();
