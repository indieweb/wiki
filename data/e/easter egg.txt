An '''<dfn>easter egg</dfn>''' is an (often small) undocumented feature, many are small jokes.

== Konami Code ==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code Konami Code] is a cheat code originating from 80s Konami video games, these days used as reference, or as an actual, functioning Easter egg on websites: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a. 

This is vanilla JS, no framework is needed.

<pre>function kcl(cb) {
  var input = '';
  var key = '38384040373937396665';
  document.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
    input += ("" + e.keyCode);
    if (input === key) {
      return cb();
    }
    if (!key.indexOf(input)) return;
    input = ("" + e.keyCode);
  });
}

kcl(function () {
    // do something here
})</pre>
