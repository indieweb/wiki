'''<dfn>expiring token</dfn>''' is a [[token]], probably an [[access token]], that automatically expires after certain use or after a specified amount of time.

* Use-case: if you want to give a 3rd party site or service a token to post on your behalf but not worry about that site holding onto the token longer than they should, or using it more often than you want them to.
