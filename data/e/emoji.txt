'''<dfn>Emoji</dfn>''' are “picture characters” originally associated with cellular telephone usage in Japan, but now popular worldwide. The word emoji comes from the Japanese 絵 (e ≅ picture) + 文字 (moji ≅ written character).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Emoji are prominently used in [[reacji]] responses.

* {{aaronpk}} includes emoji characters in note and photo contents, and outputs the raw emoji characters in the HTML rather than replacing them with images. Examples: [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/18/18/travel] [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/16/16/]

== issues ==
=== platform differences ===
Emoji are rendered differently on different platforms, with some examples leading to differing interpretations of the same emoji, depending on how they are displayed to the user (see also articles [http://grouplens.org/blog/investigating-the-potential-for-miscommunication-using-emoji/], [http://mentalfloss.com/article/70879/9-emojis-look-completely-different-other-phones]).

=== standardized vs platform-specific display ===
Many silos standardize their emoji display by replacing them with the same image on all platforms. (e.g. [[WhatsApp]], [[Twitter]], [[Telegram]], [[Threma]]). Replacing them with images also allows to show colored emoji everywhere, which is very difficult using fonts, since there are conflicting standards for multi-colored glyphs. Several permissively-licensed image sets are available, e.g. by [https://github.com/twitter/twemoji Twitter], [http://emojione.com/ Emoji One] and [https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji Google]. If a site replaces emoji with images, it should set the alt="" attribute to the text version of the emoji.

=== accessibility ====
Many people have begun to put large strings of emojis into usernames. Accessibility experts argue those who use screen readers must get through verbal explanations of each emoji in a field that was designed for a name and not biographical information.
