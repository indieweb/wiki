'''<dfn>Emoji</dfn>''' are ‚Äúpicture characters‚Äù often used like [[emoticon]]s, either expressively or as punctuation in text [[note]]s, as self-standing responses in conversations, or as reactions ([[reacji]]).

== Why ==
Emoji can be used to briefly communicate an impression, or more creatively punctuate and add emotional context to plain text.

== How to ==
=== How to support ===
As a developer of IndieWeb related software and services, supporting emoji requires paying careful attention to three areas:
* user input: make sure wherever a user can enter text that you handle emoji either by allowing and supporting it, or providing good feedback to the user where it may be disallowed  (e.g. perhaps in a username)
* storage: make sure your software and interfaces which store textual content support full fidelity Unicode both storing and retrieving
* display: either directly render emoji via its Unicode characters, or if you are doing the extra work to display representative images (like many [[social media]] silos do), be sure to put the the respective Unicode characters in the <code>alt</code> text of the images

See this article for more support and implementation tips:

__TOC__
== IndieWeb Examples ==
Emoji are prominently used in [[reacji]] responses and [[tagmoji]] aggregation pages.

* {{aaronpk}} includes emoji characters in note and photo contents, and outputs the raw emoji characters in the HTML rather than replacing them with images. Examples: [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/18/18/travel] [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/16/16/]
* {{aaronpk}}'s [[posts]] show a different profile picture depending on the emoji used in the post. more info: [https://aaronparecki.com/2019/02/25/9/emoji Emoji avatars for my website]

== Issues ==
=== standardized vs platform-specific display ===
Many silos standardize their emoji display by replacing them with the same image on all platforms. (e.g. [[WhatsApp]], [[Twitter]], [[Telegram]], [[Threma]]). Replacing them with images also allows to show colored emoji everywhere, which is very difficult using fonts, since there are conflicting standards for multi-colored glyphs. Several permissively-licensed image sets are available, e.g. by [https://github.com/twitter/twemoji Twitter], [http://emojione.com/ Emoji One] and [https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji Google]. If a site replaces emoji with images, it should set the alt="" attribute to the text version of the emoji.

== Criticism ==
=== miscommunication ===
Emoji are rendered <span id="platform_differences">differently on different platforms</span>, devices, and operating systems, with some examples leading to differing interpretations of the same emoji, depending on how they are displayed to the user.

Sometimes these differences can be stark enough to cause a miscommunication between senders and readers.

=== may harm accessibility ===
Many people have begun to put large strings of emojis into usernames. Accessibility experts argue those who use screen readers must get through verbal explanations of each emoji in a field that was designed for a name and not biographical information.

== History ==
Emoji were originally associated with cellular telephone usage in Japan, but now popular worldwide. The word emoji comes from the Japanese Áµµ (e ‚âÖ picture) + ÊñáÂ≠ó (moji ‚âÖ written character).
