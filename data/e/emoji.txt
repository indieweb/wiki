'''<dfn>Emoji</dfn>''' are “picture characters” often used like [[emoticon]]s, either expressively or as punctuation in text [[note]]s, as self-standing responses in conversations, or as reactions ([[reacji]]).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Emoji are prominently used in [[reacji]] responses.

* {{aaronpk}} includes emoji characters in note and photo contents, and outputs the raw emoji characters in the HTML rather than replacing them with images. Examples: [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/18/18/travel] [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/16/16/]
* {{aaronpk}}'s [[posts]] show a different profile picture depending on the emoji used in the post. more info: [https://aaronparecki.com/2019/02/25/9/emoji Emoji avatars for my website]

== Issues ==
=== standardized vs platform-specific display ===
Many silos standardize their emoji display by replacing them with the same image on all platforms. (e.g. [[WhatsApp]], [[Twitter]], [[Telegram]], [[Threma]]). Replacing them with images also allows to show colored emoji everywhere, which is very difficult using fonts, since there are conflicting standards for multi-colored glyphs. Several permissively-licensed image sets are available, e.g. by [https://github.com/twitter/twemoji Twitter], [http://emojione.com/ Emoji One] and [https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji Google]. If a site replaces emoji with images, it should set the alt="" attribute to the text version of the emoji.

== Criticism ==
=== miscommunication ===
Emoji are rendered <span id="platform_differences">differently on different platforms</span>, devices, and operating systems, with some examples leading to differing interpretations of the same emoji, depending on how they are displayed to the user.

Sometimes these differences can be stark enough to cause a miscommunication between senders and readers.

** "We, the people of the internet, deserve a hug emoji that is solemn and sympathetic and doesn’t look like you’re mocking the person with jazz hands 🤗" [http://www.astrokatie.com/book @AstroKatie] August 29, 2020

=== may harm accessibility ===
Many people have begun to put large strings of emojis into usernames. Accessibility experts argue those who use screen readers must get through verbal explanations of each emoji in a field that was designed for a name and not biographical information.
