'''<dfn>[https://edublogs.org/ edublogs]</dfn>''' is a [[hosting#Hosted_CMS_Software_as_Service|hosted]] custom version of [[WordPress]] geared toward students, teachers, and educational institutions.

Very similar in flavor to [[WordPress.com]], the platform features a heavily moderated selection of themes and plugins primarily geared toward the education market. It provides the ability for teachers to moderate students' content as well as privacy control for posts and comments.

While useful for educators and students, the platform isn't as flexible as WordPress.org for Indieweb use.

It does have a useful built in [[reader]] with the ability to [[follow]] other blogs on the platform. The reader functionality has been open sourced on GitHub at https://github.com/wpmudev/msreader. 

It does provide the standard WordPress [[export]] so that students can create an online identity that they could port out and take with them at a later date.

The company also has a related (paid) enterprise grade hosted version as well for K-12, colleges, and universities with [https://campuspress.com/ CampusPress].
