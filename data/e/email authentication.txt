{{stub}}

'''<dfn>email authentication</dfn>''' is an alternative sign-in method to the classic username password method, where the user only enters an email address, the site then emails the user a unique sign-in link, which upon clicking they are authenticated. If you add a [[rel-me]] link from your site to your email, then login services that support [[RelMeAuth]] may provide you the option of signing in via email authentication.
