{{stub}}

'''<dfn>embargo</dfn>''' is, in the context of the IndieWeb, the publishing practice of requiring [[exclusive]] rights to publish an [[article]] by an author on a publisher’s website, some amount of time (typicaly days, sometimes months) before the author publishes it on their own personal site.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* GoDaddy's [https://www.godaddy.com/garage/contribute/ Garage blog] has published various pieces about IndieWeb written by community members. They encourage contributors to post the content on their own site too while asking that the author wait a few days first and mention that it appeared first on the GoDaddy Garage blog and include a [[rel-canonical]] tag. As a result, these two posts could be owned by their original authors on their own websites:
** [https://www.godaddy.com/garage/indie-websites-can-set-you-free-from-the-constraints-of-social-media/ Indie websites can set you free from the constraints of social media]
** [https://www.godaddy.com/garage/indieweb-facebook-opportunities/ The IndieWeb outside of Facebook is full of opportunities]

== Other Examples ==
* [https://alistapart.com/ AListApart] has a two month embargo after publication in which the author may not reprint their article anywhere else—including their blog. The author retains copyright to thieir article’s content (though not the accompanying illustration, if it has one).

== Brainstorming ==
It would be nice if [[webmentions]] to an embargoed [[article]] could be [[backfeed|backfed]] not only to the original (canonical) on the publisher's website, but if they could also be backfed to the author's copy.  Perhaps this could be done via [[Bridgy]] with the appropriate use of scraping and cross-linking the permalink of the original to the author's copy by use of appropriate [[rel-canonical]] and [[rel-alternate]] tags on the original and the copy.
