** "Perhaps the most surprising result was that in this generation, the first to grow up with social media woven into their lives, nearly half report that they wish that each of TikTok (47%), Snapchat (43%), and X (formerly Twitter, 50%) were never invented, while less than a quarter wish that YouTube (15%), Netflix (17%), the internet itself (17%), messaging apps (19%), and the smartphone (21%) were never invented."
