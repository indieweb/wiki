I highly recommend this article if you're at all interested in vim or LaTeX! -Jacob

Welcome Aaron Klemm!
* runs a Known instance for his personal site
https://aaronklemm.me

Question: What to put at the root of your website?
* Want to make IndieAuth work
* "where to put a post?" https://indieweb.org/URL_design

{{GWG}} my problem is date-based navigation (see [[archive]])
* If you're on a single post, there's no link to all the posts of that day (or month)

Jacob asked about having a feed aggregator feature on his own website (not login protected)
* https://indieweb.org/reader#Why_integrated_personal_reader
* if it's going to be public, block it with a robots.txt
* especially ok if it's "just" links and names of posts

Example of public aggregator feed for indieweb topic: https://stream.indieweb.org/
