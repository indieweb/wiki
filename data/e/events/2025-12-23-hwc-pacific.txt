== Notes ==
Welcome to HWC Pacific holiday edition. What is everyone doing or interested in doing on their sites?

* Anthony https://omnibear.com/ a browser [[micropub]] client
* 
* Mossymaker is working on evaluating CMS options...maybe try out Known?
* {{gwg}} discussed his new photos site, followup question from Joe about [[backup]] for such a large photo set
* https://rclone.org/ new domain for images https://img.shanske.xyz [[Immich]] as one backup https://immich.app/
* {{gwg}} writes his tech articles with a different style than his website, which is for personal stuff, at https://www.gadgetwisdom.com/author/dshanske/ . 

* Alan
** https://alanwsmith.com
** Working on a [[web component]] library called https://www.bitty-js.com/
** framework, no requirement for npm install
** 

* 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies, two types of media, one copy offsite
Morgan follows the 3-2-1 rule based on advice from HWC's! Specifically Ross
{{gwg}} may follow the insanely redundant more than 3 backup system.

* joe
* https://artlung.com/firehose/ had a bug on his aggregated feeds page "the firehose" and added himself to [[firehose]]

TLDR: Morgan got really stressed the last month due to worsening health. But it has improved and he is ready to embark on some Paid Family Medical Leave (Thank you Washington State) and maybe do a little on his website also
-> Website for his PlayDate Game, https://airbridge.ac.nz
-> Personal website updates???

* December Adventure - Ross is doing [[December_Adventure]]
**A webmention implementation
**https://rossabaker.com/notes/december-adventure-2025-12-22/ (latest post)

** KBBL so far: https://codeberg.org/rossabaker/kbbl
** https://crates.io/crates - Crates can be a library or a binary

* Passing of

Morgan has a question for Ross and the chat about GPG! :hand up:

* {{alabut}} published some semi-private stuff:
** An unlisted gallery of photos from IWCSD to send around to attendees and collect approvals for publishing
** The corresponding blog post got accidentally published before it was ready! It went out to RSS in a skeleton outline format and it's convinced me to not auto-generate feeds anymore.

Aside "RSS and a Prayer" could be a good feed reader name
(not actually) Obligatory music video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA

{{t}} has a 10min delay in his Atom feed to have some extra time to fix typos etc before posts show up in his Atom feed
* also decided to only put his original posts not responses in his Atom feed
* mostly legacy support
* some decision to support Atom + Activity Streams 1.0 so folks writing consuming code could have test cases

* {{artlung}} saw {{alabut}}'s mis-publish and thought it was well-formatted, did look early, but was a great outline for the post to come later!

* Morgan just spent 6 minutes finding his own RSS feed before remembering how to check source for it
Morgan has a default RSS feed setup on his website from a hugo theme, https://www.morganwebdev.org/index.xml

* {{burgeonlab}} also use Hugo and has set up an Atom feed along with RSS. Atom improves content handling so I use it to display full-content (code blocks, images, etc), whereas the RSS version is very simple with just a text summary and the featured image https://burgeonlab.com/subscribe. I wrote about what I learnt a while back https://burgeonlab.com/blog/about-rss-feeds/
* An example of a subscription / Patreon feed: https://www.404media.co/404-media-now-has-a-full-text-rss-feed/ 

[[granary]] to convert from microformats2 to other formats, including Atom

* https://gregorlove.com/stream/ ~ https://gregorlove.com/stream/feed.atom is a redirect to the granary representation of the html
** If Gregor cached that output he could implement an RSS/Atom feed publishing delay to assure intentional feed updates
** From Joe's question about caching, my URL sends a 302 rerdirect and the Granary URL returns a header of `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300.0` which seems reasonable. Still an open question if feed readers are respecting the 302 status code and polling my feed.atom link, or if they stick with the resulting Granary URL.

* SUPER useful blog post on how to use Granary for auto-conversion: https://jamesg.blog/2024/06/06/publish-h-feed

Ross is preparing his Code 2025 post.  
- Old birdsite tradition to list all the languages you used in the last year.
- Personal year-end wraps are way more fun than streaming service year-end wraps. (AGREED!)
- https://rossabaker.com/series/code-year/

Morgan is planning to make the best of the next 3 months of time off. Roughly has a goal:
* 0-4 weeks off grid as much as possible
* 4-8 weeks some personal website work
* 8-12 weeks syndicating some publishing
Merry Christmas all!

{{t}} to {{aciccarello}}: check out new Wikipedia page for that venue we went to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mic_Drop_Comedy

* {{GWG}} had a process that was republishing 10 year old posts he was importing into his site from another source, and so, to this day, he does not set automatic syndication

Thanks all. Have a good Christmas/Holidays you celebrate! 
* Happy holidays Morgan!
* you too! good to see you :)

A1 sauce is blameless leave them out of this :P
MMMMmmm some A1 sounds good
To paraphrase Office Space, "Why should Al change his name, AI is the one that sucks."

Programming fonts!
Valerie shares good font for low-vision users: https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/, and there's also https://opendyslexic.org/ which is catered for dyslexic users
** Valerie's mom's experience highlights the importance of web accessibility / WCAG, e.g. larger font size shifting layout
https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/
I love Operator Mono, not free
Ross runs a customized Iosevka (https://typeof.net/Iosevka/customizer).  His customization is the font on his site.
I also love this: https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks#monospace-code

Modern Font Stacks is good for really nimble system fonts so you dont have to install or download any web fonts
* https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

(Im busy on something else now but might rejoin because of accessibility font chat. Very important and interesting)

Quick plug for my personal WCAG Project: https://guideline-journey.com/ . Its intended to be a study aid.

Give the Gift of Create Day on Christmas Day: https://events.indieweb.org/2025/12/give-the-gift-of-create-day-CwJRDkAGLz8C

Alas, ICQ is dead, but apparently some of us can never forget our ICQ number: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ

Is anyone doing very small post specific feeds like bunch of us used to on specialized Twitter accounts?

Like Jeremy Keith used to with his job title:
* https://twitter.com/jeremysjob

E.g. {{t}} has https://tantek.com/daylists which is sort of this kind of thing

* https://artlung.com/feeds/ https://artlung.com/firehose/
* how small a feed is a feed? unix plan files, affirmations bots, "riker googling" twitter and now Mastodon accounts (and all Mastodon accounts have feeds) and there's the great tumblr account [https://samepicofdavecoulier.tumblr.com/ The Same Picture of Dave Coulier Every Day]

(what is a daylist?) [[daylist]]
One form of a daylist is Spotify daylists of music, it might have other meanings

Morgan would love to get some advice about a short presentation about a website he is presenting on soon
- Very brief ;) 
* https://whatcompublichospital.org/ <- Volunteer website
* Question: why does it have ranking?
** Good html, not reliant on JavaScript
*** Can make sure pages have good HTML5 by using https://validator.w3.org/nu/, which {{burgeonlab}} has done recently to fix errors/warnings
** Page performance, and good use of meta tags also help
** Sometimes content is so specific that you're likely to be the main result because of what people are searching for - David GWG}}
** gRegor: probably the really good domain name too: specific region name (county) and generic term (hospital)
* Changes may occur

[temp] Now that Ross has butted in line, he found the hand raise button.  Sorry, all!
