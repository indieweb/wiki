We should add things like the Carnival and Movie Club as more ways to get involved and connect to the home page, maybe IndieBookClub also?

Hello from Vienna - James
* I hope you all are having a wonderful meeting!
** I hope you are enjoying the Vienna. You should be enjoying the sights instead of trying to jump on Tantek actually changing the main page of the indieweb.org. And comparison of IndieWeb and meat-eating vs. veganism. And discussion about IndieWeb Movie club. That was about it for the last hour.
** Vienna is a very nice and walkable city (or at least it was 6 years ago, when I lived there), so stop looking at the screens
** :) -- it is indeed a very walkable city! And I have enjoyed many sights thus far!
