== Notes ==

How do you sell a web side project? Alistair wrote an article:
- https://alistairshepherd.uk/writing/selling-web-project/

RSS feeds can include items in the future, James had to *un-break* his feed reader to support them.

James's website has a new design and internal search engine ðŸŽ‰
- https://jamesg.blog

Website navigation: a list of link at the bottom of a page, or in a separate page, can go a long way.

Tall pages are fine: devices are good at showing long pages, and `scroll-snap` can help with 'aiming'. (Documentation on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap)

Reading long articles: top bars that disappear and reappear if you scroll back up can be annoying. Reading page-by-page, scrolling with the keyboard (`Space` or `Page Up/Down`) can be less distracting.

Accessibility: make targets big!

Diagonal borders between sections of a page, Greyson uses `clip-path` on his website. (Documentation on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)
- https://greyson.scot

```
clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 calc(100% - var(--diagonal)));
```

Small devices for working on your website when not at home? So many options, but results vary.
- phone that attach to screens and keyboards
- Linux phones!
- tablets of various kinds, with keyboard covers
- odd Rasperry Pi contraptions

Learning to play a bagpipe can be painful. For others. Can you play Taylor Swift songs on a bagpipe? (this is HWC *Edinburgh* after all)

Persistent coffee stains coming soon on James' website.

Add-ons/extensions for prescription glasses are the future: wipers, QR code projectors, colour filters.
