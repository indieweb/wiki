== Notes ==
* Introductions + welcome
* Organising content
** Some posts can't be organised across time
** Horizontal scrolling w/ structured posts: https://amar.io/memo/
** Use a map as a way to display the content on your website?
** Tag cloud - bigger words for more articles tagged with that word

[[Tantek-ing]]
[[Special:WhatLinksHere/IndieAuth_Ticket_Auth]] - a useful way to visualise links between pages on a MediaWiki
* is there a mediawiki extension for automatically linking to jargon?
* add custom definitions to commonly used words?
** hover cards for definitions or another page in an iframe / a preview to where the link would take you
** use some language processing techniques to find the most commonly used words


https://github.com/yousefamar/bookmarkdown
* visibility: public, private, protected - audience tagging
* micropub as a way of posting something
** standard: [[Micropub]]
** using micropub anyone could use bookmarkdown
** https://quill.p3k.io/
** ticketauth: [[ticketauth]]
*** how do you see content that is only available to someone? that's the problem ticketauth aims to solve.
** microformats: https://microformats.org/wiki - [[h-entry]] (for individual posts)

* private posting
** post privately using an indieauth sign in
** create a post then issue a ticket using ticketauth
** prevents you from worrying about signing in to lots of indieweb websites
** http://macaroons.io/ - token that gives you granular access to something

* temperature converter that has an offline version
** maybe jeremy keith's ideas on offline would be useful?
** a good cassis ([[CASSIS]]) demo w/ service worker?
** once you have loaded the page, it would not need to access the network ever again
** the whole conversion ui would work without js â€” using serverside form submissions
** see https://asin.cc/ for a simple computational form example / demo of CASSIS

* writing code that's easier to understand over a long period of time
** development principle used by {{t}} in CASSIS
** use a subset of PHP that is what you are familiar with from using other languages
* ... add notes
