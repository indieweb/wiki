== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC Eastern! Goal is for these to be every 2 weeks alternating with HWC Pacific!
* Music is the best. Discussing {{artlung}}'s mix which includes "The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys" https://artlung.com/mixtapes/2020/
** porting music playlists - find random online service and convert as needed

* PDF tools - many are built into Firefox (Thomas moved away from ARC and into Zen browser (*https://zen-browser.app/) which is Firefox based) - This is Thomas' work and research browser that can take a beating and have multiple disparate spaces.
** DevonThink allows a continuous single PDF view of a webpage (single giant document)

== What did you build today? ==
* Manny built some anxiety
* David wrote a long rambling on shared rides locations (blog)
* Thomas plan is to investigate Firefox because of strong PDF tools
* Regular expressions and fart jokes - Ross
* Joe investigated stripes https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/xbwePrd border-image-source 
* gRegor nothing personal but added https://gregorlove.com/2025/09/lessons-custom-wordpress-plugins/ recently
** Addendum: I guess I did some small personal things: I changed the slug on this post and found that the redirects weren't working for the public -- I had the code handling that behind an admin-only flag, oops! Updated and tested agan and redirects work now, like https://gregorlove.com/starbucks redirects to my [[coffee]] page
** https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/13/updates-for-a-private-plugin
* Pat recorded a podcast. She's a frequent guest on the Salon Success podcast https://monaco.ac.nz/category/business/salon-success-podcast/

== Playlists ==
* Playlists are proprietary - same version of a track is not always available to be played 
* https://song.link
** https://song.link/i/1660600181
** API, but no new keys and low rate limit: https://linktree.notion.site/API-d0ebe08a5e304a55928405eb682f6741
** Fascinating stuff. Makes me want to add export or even auto-generate some alternate playlists on other services

== What will you build in the next 2 weeks ==
* {{mandaris}} - moving to Codeberg https://codeberg.org/
** there are limitations with GitHub, reconclling technology choices
** https://giveupgithub.org
*** https://codeberg.org/rossabaker/giveupgithub.sh
* Ross automate [[PESOS]] pipeline - Mastodon and Pixelfed. Learning some python for that
** Dagster https://dagster.io/ - "assets and ops" (raw data from mastodon, merge data into complete document) - maybe get twitter archive as well - then put them into Hugo content adapters
** Football data analytics
* Thomas
** Get August movie club out
** Search for his own website. - enjoying searching 2100 blog posts
* Playing with analytics
* Angelo
** sign into my site and support github - to step through indie signup
** doppler color code thing - and indieauth
* Pat
** Working on a Podcast - New Zealand podcast

* [[RelMeAuth]]
* [[indieauth.com]] 
* [[authorization-endpoint]]

From https://indielogin.com/setup, PGP is having issues and disabled for now.

== Modern uses for PGP ==
* IndieLogin, comes and goes (see above)
* Encrypted e-mail (content, but not headers!)
* Profile verification. e.g., https://keyoxide.org/wkd/ross%40rossabaker.com [[Keyoxide]]
* The JVM ecosystem uses it for signing publsihed artifacts

== More on Music ==

* [[playlist]]
** Libre.fm froze new users but still works fine 
** Crucial Tracks - Manny uses that, as does Nick Simson 
* Music a hard problem (licensing, lock in, silos)
* {{gRegor}} kind of surprisingly, YouTube Music seems to work when you share a playlist, even if you're not signed in with a YT account: https://gregorlove.com/2019/06/here-is-the-playlist-i-made/
* Thomas' playlist from Tidal for Friday Morning playlist - https://tidal.com/playlist/b8d5b886-8acf-4849-bed4-02895492921a
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_(service)
** [[Tidal]]
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio : gone almost 10 years, but not forgotten
** https://musicbrainz.org/
** Slacker Radio https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveOne 
** BMG: "12 CDs for a penny!"
** For any API call, pagination is important
** Indie sharing of playlists
** Classical music is a whole nother beast - 100%

== Plans in the next 2 weeks ==

* Anthony C
** Books and "watch"es on his site
** View Transitions https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API
** Debugging them is difficult (to and from both need to account for it)
** Recent photo posts https://www.ciccarello.me/posts/2025/09/10/64baf/
** Has a micropub endpoint
* Photo Storage! - the NAS is slow - painful 
** 45000 photos
** 27000 photos
* Pat working on documenting the digital garden Obsidian plugin
** Will get back to it with another assignment
** Has been working on URL patterns (urls ought to be stable) (urls ought to be human readable)
** How to do redirects?
** Thinking about using frontmatter for redirects 'dg-permalink' as 'main' or 'true' URI and 'aliases' as redirect options but ideally allow wildcards to work 
** https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_speling.html
** https://serverfault.com/questions/955100/mod-speling-case-insensitive-urls-not-working

* Testing of Angelo's https://ragt.ag/guests
