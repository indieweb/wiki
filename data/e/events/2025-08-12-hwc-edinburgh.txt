== Notes ==
* User interfaces to show who authored what parts of a collaborative text
** This could be implemented with CSS checkboxes, a :has filter, and the <code>mark</code> HTML element.
** {{capjamesg}} made https://playground.jamesg.blog/authorship.html after the meetup based on this idea.
** Regarding collaborative editing, {{ straydogstrut }} mentioned https://www.wikitree.com/, a global family tree platform and https://weare.xyz/, a family archive platform that supports multiple contributors.
* meta: author and fediverse:creator
* https://streetpass.social keeps track of people you have "passed" on the Web who have a Fediverse account.
** What is the open web equivalent?
* UX: People, not pipes
* An obstacle of using RSS is that you have to choose to subscribe to something; the same is true for "read later" apps.
** Combining the ideas of streetpass.social for the open web means you could keep track of people whose works you have read and then at a later date choose whether to subscribe to them.
* What if there was a way for your friends to recommend articles they have enjoyed by an author who you both follow on the web?
* Syncing bookmarks is hard
** https://raindrop.io/ is helpful
* Pages vs. blogs and their temporal aspects -- pages as something that can update at any time, whereas blogs are mainly in reverse chronological order
** Recipes, for example, are not time bound
* Websites for friends and family
** {{ straydogstrut }} is planning a family archive, inspired by https://weare.xyz/ and https://alexwlchan.net/2024/static-websites/
** Using Digital Ocean Spaces to serve media, including photos and scans of birth certificates
* Idea: A newsletter of articles published after a tech announcement 10 years ago, with analysis on how things have changed
* Real-world metaphors in design
* Use of rounded corners in design
* A newspaper UI for RSS?
** What if there was a "site obituaries" section in a web reader, with links to archived posts from the site?
* James' WIP mobile HTML editor: https://playground.jamesg.blog/predict.html
* Using Tailscale or Wireguard directly to connect devices together
* James + Francesco have both used scroll snap for horizontal scrolling (James is using it for his mobile editor)
* A /games page on your website with games people can play
* The freedom that comes with creating a blank HTML page and playing with a new design, outside the constraints of the design you already have
* Morse code as a search form input
* What would a physical Konami code look like? (i.e. making hand signals)
* HTML and CSS learning games

* Something we are interested in: Accessibility games to help people learn the basics of accessibility
* https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/
* https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/voiceover/vo28030/mac
* Setting up a separate website for professional use
* UX idea: A site designed like a notebook with a UX action that lets you flip your phone to go to the next page.
* Blog post idea: blogging as you improve the accessibility of your website, with tips for others.
* Hard question: what do you put in your site navigation?
* Using subdomains to separate out multiple interests but still use the same tech stack
* Clap to toggle light/dark mode on a website
* Accessible error messages and user notifications
** https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/notifications/ outlines different error message approaches
** https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-notifications-with-aria-live-regions-part-1/ explains why you might need live regions
** https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-notifications-with-aria-live-regions-part-2/ shows how to use live regions
* Sighted users can see all context at once on a page, whereas screen readers focus on one thing at a time.
* micro.blog photo challenge: https://challenges.micro.blog/2025/05/31/june-photo-challenge.html
* 30 days of coffee stains art project
* https://pcarrier.com/ has a bobblehead profile picture on his website
