** There are a lot of tools out there for making digital gardens! You can use tools like WordPress with posts / pages that link to each other.
** If you want a private digital garden, Roam Research / Notion / Obsidian may be worth a look! (I like Notion for my notes and personal digital garden :D)
** If you use Obsidian, you can publish your Obsidian to your own website without code with https://obsidian.md/publish
** Some people make "static sites" that are digital gardens. This involves a bit of programming. There are tools out there like Eleventy that can help, but may take a few hours to get the hang of!
** This digital garden is _huge_ but I love https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ That's a great example! Kind of what I envision for my site as well in the future.
** You can also use MediaWiki. I'm not sure if you can pay a service to host it for you, but if you can it's pretty interesting (NB: There is a maintenance burden, so maybe another tool is better.). Here's mine: https://wiki.jamesg.blog/index.php?title=Special:AllPages (example https://wiki.jamesg.blog/index.php?title=Movies)
** Question: What kind of things do you want to publish in your garden? (I'm looking for inspiration :D) Text mostly, some images, but mostly text. I envision it as a kind of storage place of what I learn when I dive into a new area of interest. Which happens quite frequently and evolves over time, so I'd love to edit and improve stuff over time.
*** I am excited to see what you make!
** https://marksuth.dev/posts/2023/08/indieweb-carnival-august-2023-gardening -- lots of blog posts on gardening!


Jasmin I'd say when using WordPress and wanting to extend it I'd say that an important step is to use a child theme that you can edit yourself. That way if you want to add. new kind of page, for example a specific template for recipes, you can add them there and still get the security of theme updates from wordpress.org. https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/ talks a bit about it. - {{artlung}}
I'll have a look at this, thanks!

{{lazcorp}} latest blog post: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/saints-and-martyrs - a compelling piece - I love how baroque (if that's the right word) it is. And I love your mention of Sisters of Mercy. The Trash Theory YouTube piece on This Corrosion is a favorite https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb3alPShWQU

(James note: I love everything about this website -- check out the homepage for an amazing comic.)

Sparking joy as main motivator for working on your personal site:
[[joy]]

And sometimes pain = fun, if that's your idea of joy. "Type 2 fun" is a phrase in the endurance sports community.

Nicole Lazzaro, brilliant gaming expert describes 4 types of fun in games: 
    https://www.nicolelazzaro.com/the4-keys-to-fun/ :
* Hard Fun: "Fiero" – in the moment personal triumph over adversity
* Easy Fun: Curiosity
* Serious Fun: Relaxation and excitement
* People Fun: Amusement

Tantek: "garden manually and write code for things you find yourself doing over and over again" -> I really like this idea, since it goes so well with the "gardening" metaphor. Grow things organically over time instead of planning them out from scratch.
- James: love this point!

== Chatting About Recommendation Algorithms == 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system
If you have questions about technical details, message James! I enjoy learning about the technical details of these systems! (and evaluating what makes sense and when; and when an algorithm isn't the right thing to use!)

https://dead.garden/blog/search-engine-hostility.html

On the discussion relating to recommendation systems. I've enjoyed this blogpost about curation a lot: https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/ 
Personally, I've found myself turning away more and more from algorithmic recommendation systems and turn more towards seeking out other people's opinions. And actively seeking out people whose opinions and recommendations I can trust.

Paul Ford's Six Word Reviews: http://www.smithmag.net/obsessions/2009/03/19/paul-fords-six-word-sxsw-reviews/ "To celebrate the beginning of this year’s South by Southwest music festival, Paul Ford from The Morning News wrote 1,302 six-word reviews of mp3s submitted by this year’s bands."
