image analysis by AI for providing text description

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8wcbJR9IaU Discriminiative AI to describe images 

“I’ve come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies,” writes Douglas Adams in The Salmon of Doubt.
1. "Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works."
2. "Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it."
3. "Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things."

* but also adding a prefix to ai generated descriptions prior to that description would assisst the user in context
