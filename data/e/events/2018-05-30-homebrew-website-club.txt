== Notes ==
<!-- HELP: the chat link should always be here, just make sure the date is right. -->
* [https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-05-30 Chat archives 2018-05-30]
=== vHWC ===
* reader developments
** why are readers interesting right now for us?
*** used a lot
*** increasing issues with using silos through traditional readers
*** more control over bookmarks, archiving
*** likes as bookmarks on Twitter, various other meanings of likes (triggered by https://jgregorymcverry.com/2954-2/, see https://petermolnar.net/making-things-private/ and https://seblog.nl/2017/10/09/9/bookmarks-and-likes too)
* archiving
** what to archive (reader inputs, bookmarks, ...)
** storage formats
** https://0a.fi/backups/backing-youtube-playlist/
* difficulties of owning IP space
* site structure & posting interfaces
** https://svbtle.com/about
** Facebooks mobile interface for "life-logging" like posts
** MP very blogg-y, limited by perceived need for extensions
** [[ikiwiki]] as example where blog is a secondary format, pages in general free form
** less timeline-centric means page-history becomes more important (wikis)
