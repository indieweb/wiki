Philip created a [[Kirby]] deployment on GitHub Pages which allows him to work with [[Kirby]] despite the limitations of his current computer. 
He also created a demo to use the Leaflet library in [[React]] to display map data and put markers on it. He wants to use it for the buddhist community he is part of.

Max updated his Changelog page to make it more pretty. He also created a '[https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/opinion/lines-and-veils-rpg-safety-tools Lines & Veils]' tool for his D&D group. The code is available on GitHub.

{{bjoern}} didn't have much time for his website as he got himself a 3D printer. He demonstrated how easy it is nowadays to design objects and generate 3D models of them using OnShape. He also showed https://nething.xyz/ to generate CAD code from an AI query.

Alex talked about teaching [https://scratch.mit.edu/ Scratch] at a local school.
