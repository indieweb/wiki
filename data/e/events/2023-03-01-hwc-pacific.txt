=== [[Projects]] Wiki Page Cleaning ===
* [[projects]]
* Tries to be everything all at once
* Probably better to point towards other pages (e.g. the language pages we link to)
* Is linked to from the home page ("use and contribute to projects") so presumibly higher traffic
* There's a significant overlap with [[Getting Started]]
* Some people have less use for the projects page (e.g. Wordpress users)

=== [[Principles]] ===
* Probably more issues with this page
* Could potentially have a Popup to coordinate changes
* Principles should not be numbered
* Does anyone refer to these numbers?
* People don't even agree on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments#Numbering numbering of the 10 Commandments]
* Ten Commandments vs 11 Indieweb Principles vs 7 Laws of Noah "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's data?"

=== Events On Wiki ===
* Date formats are confusing
* Lots of manual updates: events.indieweb.org, wiki

== AI ==
* https://humanstxt.org/
* Trust in a world of AI, misinformation, bots, and political agents impersonating e.g. journalists
* Similar issues to trust & fake news
* AI allows massive scale-up of spam, misinformation, etc. -- *fast*
* How can IndieWeb be an answer and a haven from AI-generated poor quality information and disinformation?
