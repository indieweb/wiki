'''<dfn>[https://events.indieweb.org/2024/12/homebrew-website-club-nuremberg-germany-CvjQXWe1RQYR Homebrew Website Club Nürnberg]</dfn>''' is an IndieWeb meetup in real life that took place on 2024-12-11.

We were once again very happy to be hosted by [https://leonardo-zentrum.de/ LEONARDO - Zentrum für Kreativität und Innovation].

== Participants ==

* {{bjoern}} - https://bjoern.stierand.org
* Tilman Zitzmann - https://tilman.me
* Max Häßlein - https://www.maxhaesslein.de
* Philip Saa - https://mc.scrpt.live/

== Notes ==

Max showed the code for the audio player he uses on his website (see an example on https://www.maxhaesslein.de/audio/soundscapes/nuernberger-volksfest/) as well as an example on p5js where a visual element reacts to the currently playing audio.

As a holiday gift Max also handed out some gift codes to use the [[Kagi]] search engine for free for 3 months. Happy holidays to us!

There was also some talk about conferences (like Beyond Tellerrand or TEDx Nuremberg, which took place a week ago).

We're looking forward to continue world's onliest real-life HWC in 2025!
