We discussed the responsbilities of a webmention sender.

E.g. if you change a page, you should resend webmentions to everything it links to.

Like a post, that has links to comments / replies to that post, should send webmentions to all of those when the post is updated, and then leave it up to their recipients to figure out what to do.

We discussed the function of wiki (like Wikipedia) Talk: pages in contrast to the page itself, and edits vs. discussion about edits as a way to encourage a more civil and polite way to approach potential controversy and conflict resolution.

GWG showed off his IWC logo'd mask!

The next logical question of course is can we take the eat your cooking, cook what you want to eat metaphor into sewing/clothing

Do you sew what you want to wear? 

Do you wear what you sew to try it out and iterate on it?
