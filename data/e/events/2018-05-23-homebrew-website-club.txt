Participants: jgmac1106, Klandwehr, Matigo, Vanessa, {{Zegnat}}, {{sknebel}}, {{jeremycherfas}}

Some of the topics we talked about:

# WordPress and titles when POSSE to silos; needs to be more workable. 
# Problems with Post-Kinds and replying to a post
## jgmac1106 showed us how to go to Screen Options and tick Response Properties
# Then we talked about (human) languages for a bit.
# jgmac1106 explained about his learning of CSS and his continuing experiments with WP.
# Some discussion of CSS for different viewports.
# And the use of Retina images.
# The future of Known and more generally the desire for a turnkey IndieWeb solution.
# Talked about 10Cv5 a bit and micro.blog. No one solution will suit everybody.
# General agreement that Manton targetted a niche market and delivered what that market by and large wanted.
# People who want more out of their identity online will want more than micro.blog.
# Possibility of funding an update of Known.
# Many people '''want''' a social community, which places a value on being able to feed to micro.blog and elsewhere.
# IndieWeb focussed readers will make a huge difference.
# Discovery in a global timeline can be useful, although many people do not use it.
# Bring back Technorati!
