=== What are you working on with your website ===
* {{aciccarello}}

* {{artlung}}

** Indexing public flickr photos into his site

=== Discussion ===
* Instagram/Facebook have historically been hostile to integration
* {{aciccarello}} got tired of how the Twitter and Instagram was pushing content he wasn't following, making it harder to see content he wanted
* In Europe, Instagram makes it a lot easier to get your followers-only feed than in the US
* Observations based on conversations Instagram is how folks find businesses more than Facebook, more than websites
* Anecdotally, {{artlung}} has a post inside Instagram in which he embedded a QR Code to the POSSE link on his site. It's been a week and it has had no interactions, no likes. Has the post been shadowbanned? Or do the folks who saw it just not like it? How would I tell the difference?
* Instagram has a specific format they prefer/promote and coerce users into that format
* {{aciccarello}} likes that he can use whatever format he wants on his website
* Tags on blogs used to be really useful to see people's related posts but on Instagram it tends to be a lot of noise
* Bridged posts to mastodon/bluesky will often get bot interactions based on tags
* {{artlung}} has been posting CSS Battle streams to YouTube and it is interesting what metadata Google requests https://artlung.com/cssbattles/ - he uses PHP composer to read [[YouTube]] [[RSS]] and pull in the metadata for display
* https://www.madcss.com/ is a current kind of CSS battle with some web folks who are notable in CSS
* {{aciccarello}} is still thinking about how to continue improving useful indieweb projects
** Avoiding maintainer burnout and getting more people involved seems important
