* {{benji}} demonstrated his watched page
* Some people will back-date posts to when they happened (published date old, updated as current date)

* {{aciccarello}} used cooklang with [https://www.ciccarello.me/recipes/2022/04/23/greek-meatballs-and-lemon-butter-orzo/ this recipe] ([https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/blob/241aca9bc18637be3a49f5a26db27d83d074c583/_posts/recipes/2022-04-22-greek-meatballs-and-lemon-butter-orzo.md source]) but hasn't used cooklang since
* Cooklang rendered output will sometimes list ingredients multiple times (if used in different steps)
* {{aciccarello}} would love to have ability to scale recipe ingredients

* {{aciccarello}} has intentionally avoided adding locations to posts to counteract "Instagram culture" where popular photos triggering overcrowding at a few places rather than exploring places nearby.

* What is a [[CMS]]?
** What is the difference between a CMS, SSG, static site CMS?
* {{aciccarello}} uses [[Netlify CMS]]. Considers a SSG a tool to generate HTML from a content source. CMS is a tool to create/manage content, and a SS CMS a tool to create/manage the source for a SSG.
