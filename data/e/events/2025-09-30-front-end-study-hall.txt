* Why is it so difficult to build a website on my phone?
** Smart phone was designed to be an entertainment device 
*** But I want my phone to be delightful :(
** Smart phone screen is very small
*** How much are you willing to carry with you on a phone? Decent input device?
*** What would it look like to have an audio input device? (speak and your phone starts to build the web page)
** Better input device? Very good camera? Creative work with a camera! (TikTok! Reels! Video!)
** On iOS:Notes app surprisingly good (many folks use Notes app into their phone) - good enough
** What if the Notes/Photos app had a checkbox you could check to put a note or photo on your website?
*** somewhere someone had built an iCloud "sync" client that you gave access to your Notes and then it auto-posted (or synced) the ones you selected to a website
** It would be cool if you could customise your keyboard to make < and > more prominent.
** there are iPhone apps that have given extended keyboard needs and added them in the UI above the keyboard for easy use
*** Runestone is one of the apps for iOS with coding related keys in prominant view. I've used it to post HTML marked-up entries to my site
** There are quite a few custom keyboards available to select that are focussed on different needs

** How come people don't make websites with phone?
** Is there a difference between making a website and making content for the web?
** Templating systems come up (social media is the recipient!)

* Marty did a talk at IndieWeb Summir 2019 - "Posting from my Phone"
** used micropub, shortcuts
** shortcut permission model, walled gardens
** Quill editor
** [[omnibear]] browser extension for Micropub, also a non-trivial amount of maintenance debt with browser changes
** https://sparkles.sploot.com is a PWA

* (evil solution) Log in Replit and get it to do it
** Accidentially deleted production database

* James experience writing HTML on his phone, if tooling were better would 
** VSCode in the browser - real time editing group editing
** https://vscode.dev  - relatively poor on a phone as all the VS Code chrome takes up the whole screen

* TIL: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skewampus
