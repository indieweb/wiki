authentication using hashes (?) through different onion instances
~ IndieWeb alternative to DID?

nested communities - subcommunities within larger communities
e.g. micro.blog knitting channel nested within big picture community of people who don't like the silos
what level community does change need to happen? 

we need to define a vision of a world that's clearly better than the silos

more micro.blog-esque places that aren't microblogging

what's the value proposition for businesses to incorporate indieweb building blocks? 

IndieWeb friendly services - IndieMark assessment for biz / services
grade the silos on their indieweb friendliness
- leveraging https://indieweb.org/friendly

In addition to adding visible webmentions to the wiki (maybe using Fluffy's mention.js script?), it would be nice to have a template added to all pages to add a list of internal backlinks from the wiki. 
See example: https://indieweb.org/User:Boffosocko.com#Backlinks
