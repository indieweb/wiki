Top Topics
1. Typography and fonts
* serifs are great for print ... not so much on screens
* some UIs give reader the option
** kindle
** fanfiction
** you _don't</em> see it on news stories, encyclopedia
** serifs can be easier to read -> accessibility
** "fancy restaurants don't put salt on the table" ->
** don't forget monospace fonts, and display (e.g. fancy curly) fonts
** workhorse font for communicating info + fancy font for headlines, tab titles
** increasing the size of font for legibility
** browsers default to tiny, serifed fonts - way hard to read
** fonts to improve legibility for ppl with dyslexia, e.g. https://www.lexend.com/ 
*** https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Exa
** serif vs sans-serif may affect retention, difficulty of learning
*** link to paper? "people retain significantly more if they learn in a font that's hard to read"
**** https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/health/19mind.html#:~:text=Font%20size%20has%20no%20effect,assume%20that%20bigger%20is%20better.&text=New%20research%20finds%20that%20people,but%20also%20hard%20to%20read
**** https://www.livescience.com/9296-funky-fonts-students-learn.html 
*** supposedly Comic Sans -> more retention?
** practicaltypography.com/
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-ligatures with a live demo!
** variable fonts let you do crazy stuff (like animation) with just css
