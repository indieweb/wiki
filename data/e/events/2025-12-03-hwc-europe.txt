* {{gRegor}} wrote about the things I updated on IndieWeb Create Day last week: https://gregorlove.com/2025/11/for-todays-indieweb-create/

* Al's question: what consumes h-feed?
** Social readers: [[social_reader]]
** James uses rel="alternate" and Granary to convert his microformats into RSS
** A blog post that explains h-feed w/ Granary: https://jamesg.blog/2024/01/10/h-card-how-to (James is now realising that the slug says h-card when it should say h-feed)
** Making RSS sucks, wish microformats seems easier
** JSON feeds have become easier lately too

* {{zachary.kai}} has been doing a lot of tinkering on his sites! Such as:
** Has attempted to increase his sites' page speed load with the following methods:
*** Enabling caching and compression in the Apache config
*** Reorganizing the head tag so the stylesheet comes first
*** Combining the print stylesheet into the main stylesheet to reduce the HTTP requests
** Also updated the Apache security config for his server (simplifying the configs for all sites! Hooray!)
