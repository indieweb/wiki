=== Jonas ===
* Jonas is starting a course of study learning web technology in Sweden
** Portfolio site to show things off - https://www.jonasolson.se/ 
** Nick's reaction: gravitates to sites and portfolios where the personality comes through - and would rather see something that demonstrates how you approach development. 
*** I really like the statement on https://pjonori.design/work/preamble/
*** Live links are always helpful for development portfolios!

** Emily - avoid template / cookie cutter
* Joe: Show what you are proud of

* Web components and to do or not to do
** Don't repeat yourself
** components as a navigation
** https://brennan.day/respecting-the-no-js-choice-making-your-site-work-for-everyone/
** web spidering? 
** js dependent spiderable?
** GitHub relative-time component seems a perfect usage for it

* Blocked javascript because of ads
** adsense-blocking classnames? what classNames should be avoided?
** Example: Adblock Plus Chrome hides elements with "adsense" string in any classname
** Example: Adblock (unknown) refuses to load javascript source with "ads" string in filename
** Possible dictionaries of strings to avoid:
