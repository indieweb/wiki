Sara: James, what is the VS Code equivalent of the Grammarly? Really interested in that, if it does not require internet... (and don't want to derail the conversation with this)
** "Code Spell Checker" by Street Side Software.
** It mainly does typo identification. That's all I really wanted.
Thanks. Even if it dos only that, it is still helpful for some parts of my workflow.

We should lobby Meetable for a standard "notes" field so the Etherpad is easier to find (and subsequently the wiki archive)

Productivity discussion

* GTD - Getting Things Done book & framework for productivity
** two part inbox vs curated next-actions concept
** 43 folders concept 12 (for months) + 31 (for days of the month)

Power of the Streak

Has anyone built a streak summary UI for their own website? Like
* You've posted about topic abc N days/weeks/months in a row, post one today to keep your streak going
* either by type of post, or by hashtag

Tagging people to do posts
* post about this topic abc and then tag 3 (or more/fewer) friends to do the same
* not about replying to your post or soliciting comments/replies
* about asking for others to do their own top-level posts

E.g.
* this is a photo of something that inspired me, what is a photo of something that inspired you?
* here are my top 5 favorite albums of all time, what is your top 5?
* etc.
* An example of one attempt at that: https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/books-im-reading-october-2023

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generic_and_genericized_trademarks
* could also be a subject for 100 posts!

Are there lists of such trademarks that were elevated to generic usage (often nouns that were verbed) and then fell out of usage? (or are falling out of usage) E.g.
* Netscape
* AIM
* BBM
* MySpace / Facebook
* Slashdot -> Hacker Newsed / Reddited

* Is there a flow/process for determining plausible reply/response types for a given URL's content?
** If the reply context is an event, prioritize an RSVP reply type in editor UI
*** first use post type discovery, then something more...
** Useful for a bookmarklet for "generic reply" that, regardless of content on the current page, will open your editor with useful reply types and UX preselected
** no need to show "special" response options like RSVP on posts they don't apply to like non-events, or rather, doing so may set user expectations that are disappointed
