https://indieweb.org/poll
* https://jamesg.blog/poll/
** {{gRegor}} tried clicking a vote link (note: I don't have webactions set up), ended up at: https://jamesg.blog/poll/undefined?in-reply-to=https://jamesg.blog/poll/&content=I%20vote%20for%20Sometimes. with a 404 error
** :facepalm: - I will need to come back to this one day.
** all good. Test in prod! :)
* James, a question for you - I tried to send the webmention to you end point. The post is https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/03/in-reply-to-james-how-often-do-you-have-milk-in-your-tea/ , but it does not show in the votes. I was wondering if you expect any specific microformats?
** The status of webmention also shows as - "Operation timed out after 0 milliseconds with 0 out of 0 bytes received" (https://webmention.io/jamesg.blog/webmention/8raP-P3tmjPfkPvxBK4C)
*** {{gRegor}}: this sounds like webmention.io had an error processing, maybe couldn't load your site to verify it linked to James? (totally guessing)
** {{gRegor}}: I submitted a webmention successfully and it shows up in https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=https://jamesg.blog/poll/ but not on the page yet. I see some other votes in the replies there too.
*** {{sarajaksa}} - thanks for the tip, I did not know, this was a way to help debug it - it shows there now on resending it - it does not include the content with the value, that all the other do, so I guess there is a microformats thing as well
