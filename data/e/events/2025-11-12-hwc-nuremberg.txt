{{bjoern}} reported on his trip to [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2025 Beyond Tellerrand Berlin 2025]. Apart from meeting many interesting people there (even some of the IndieWeb community), there were many interesting talks who will get up on YouTube in the next weeks. Some recommendations are:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO5_hyglvJE Cabeza Patata - Exhausted ... But Still Excited]
* Astrid Bin - Electric Dreams: The Story of Little Character
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7sh-5UYnJc Andy Bell - Get the Core Right and the Resilient Code will Follow]

{{bjoern}} also managed to change the way he uses dynamic information on his staticly-generated website. To display information about the music he currently listens to, he created a little webservice dubbed 'musicapi' with tests, proper docs and features like rate limiting. You can see this in action on his [https://bjoern.stierand.org/now/ now] page. He also added a feature to display random posts on the homepage to make the site more accessible. There was some discussion about the layout, there is still some work to be done on the tags that are displayed (which should also be clickable).

Philipp added conditional links for events on his homepage, so the links only show up when an event is set. It seems that using Facebook events to announce dates dies down, Instagram or even the venue websites themselves are being used nowadays.
He also showed the current state of the (not yet public) speedjungle e.V. web site. Lastly, he showed the Text to Morse transformation website he works on.

Max posted new content on his site about [https://www.maxhaesslein.de/notes/shadowdark-player-driven-death-mechanics/ custom RPG death mecanics]. He also showed a key visual animation tool of a World Map he is currently building as a project.

Wolfgang had some Adobe Indesign issues with german post codes we discussed. He wanted to serial-print addresses on labels which didn't work as he expected.

Tilman demoed https://tilman.me/play/, and instance of [https://playhtml.fun PlayHTML]. There you can create realtime multiplayer "games" with WebRTC just in the browser.
