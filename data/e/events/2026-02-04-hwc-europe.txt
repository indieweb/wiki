== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!
* The days are getting longer, the evenings are getting shorter
* The false promises of speed tests
* Don't give me any more ideas!
* Social batteries refilled after attending this meeting!

=== Life Advice ===

* Don't soak or waterlog wooden bowls! Dry them immediately after use!
* Don't struggle with packet openings when scissors are on hand
* No point using valuable internet bandwith to 'prove' you're paying attention in large video meetings
* Communicative methods should adjust to the context and folks involved
* Technology doesn't always work
* It's okay to say no to things: keeping a list of said items can help you discover your priorities 
* Boundaries and where things end
* Never underestimate the power of scripting (the simplest is often the best solution)

=== Questions Discussed ===

* What do people do with webmentions? Do they have them? What service do they use? Do they export/back them up somewhere
** {{capjamesg}} loves webmentions and has accepted them for years. He keeps his private, and recieves them in his RSS Reader, that way he doesn't have to moderate them
** Think of them as a comments section or just a notification system
** You can render them, cache them, display them on your site once you decide on how to present them if you want to
** You don't have to do anything with them!
** Webmentions are mostly spam-free, but it's more of a when, not if situation
* The month's IndieWeb Carnival prompt: 'Intersecting Interests' could also be applicable to thinking through different points of view on a subject
* The constant push-pull between exploring new tools and finding concrete use-cases for them in life
** And getting too deep within something and it comes up at work and adds to your responsibilities
** If you stick it to the man and the man is yourself, what then? 'You don't tell me what to do, I tell me what to do!'
* Down with gray text on a white background or gray text on a black background
* How do you think about your projects and sites long term? What infastructure do they depend on, and what is their longevity
* Sites are inherently flexible: instant updates
* The nature of change on the web
** Website hosting as torrent file sharing
** If we want more people to participate in the web, we need to give them access to infastructure
** Paul Watson has a relevant post about this: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/where-do-i-see-the-indieweb-in-2030
** Apple used to offer a persona webspace as part of their user accounts. 
*** Related: iLife which came with a trial of iWork
* Apple Keynote vs Microsoft Powerpoint for creating presentations
** {{vanderwal}}'s stuff was used in a Steve Jobs' keynote ("he didn't respond which was a good response")
* File-sharing as a law of attraction model
* Scribd bought Slideshare and made a mess of things: where to host slides?
* The 'law of attraction' and 'day in the life' models recieving widespread use
* Wanting to be able to pike pieces of software but also customize them
** As a developer, perhaps rather than the first instinct being 'how can i build this' when not happy with a tool, could it be 'how could i modify this to suit'?
** Rather than seeing software as silos, how can they be maximally open
** Data is better open-shared than interfaces
** I want my feed reader to be my calendar and my search engine and own my data
*** Calendar subscriptions to ics files in an RSS Reader
** Progress in software shouldn't be new gimmicks, but rather how things intergrate and their trustworthiness
** A long-time principle should be portable, interoperable file formats and data presentations
** The internet depends on small projects often maintained by single people in their spare time
** There's great skill in being a developer who can pull multiple things together
** Could software be decentralized and still work, like Mastodon does?
*** ActivityPub proves there's much potential in this area
*** ATProtocol vs ActivityPub

=== Site Ideas ===

* Changing color themes based on the sun cycles (the person's timezone or the visitor's)
* Random kitchen facts for ensuring competence: never make a mistake again!
* A website that gives you blank mansuscript paper for making notes on or practicing sheet music
** {{capjamesg}} spent a few solid minutes fighting the urge to take on yet another project: the eternal struggle!
* Technology doesn't say no to us enough or set limits

=== What Have People Been Doing On Their Websites ===

* Ricardo made a post about his favorite things of 2025: https://ricardochavezt.com/my-favorite-things-from-2025
* Paul has beein looking into webmentions and putting his website onto a Raspberry Pi
* {{capjamesg}} made a few tweaks to his feed reader: in mobile mode, swipe left to hide a post, and swipe right to filter by keywords in search
** Did this via the 'swipe-list' web component and wants to open-source in future
** His first foray into interactive design. 
** A recommendation for interactivity: using the pointer API so you know when someone taps, moves, and confirms their action
* {{zachary.kai}} has been doing several things on his sites:
** https://roadlessread.com/lists/zineappreciation
** https://roadlessread.com/lists/zinesters
** https://roadlessread.com/lists/bearbc
** https://roadlessread.com/lists/iwbc
** https://roadlessread.com/lists/iwc

=== What Are People Planning To Do On Their Websites? ===

* {{capjamesg}} plans to allow deletion features and export features in his feed reader
* {{zachary.kai}} plans to finally launch the literary magazine he's been putting off for ages
* Ricardo might post for this month's IndieWeb Carnival
** {{capjames}} might write about how art and technology intersect
*** There's a perspective of being 'creative' and 'technical' being opposites but they're more 
* {{vanderwall}} might revitalize some of his old keynote presentations on folksonomy as YouTube videos

* Is your website using green energy? Worth thinking about
** Hosting in the UK is often more expensive than in the US, often because it's on green energy and that's more costly to run. It's also because the grid and infastructure is aging and needs more building
