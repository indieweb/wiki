{{gRegor}}: For Michael: putting your site into indielogin.com, I checked the redirects, it tried to send to the WP login page with a bunch of IndieAuth query parameters (which seems correct) `https://michaelkupietz.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=...` (truncated the query params) which then redirected to a 404 page on your site. Maybe a security plugin like WordFence is interfering? 
** Yes, I changed my login url. The ordinary wp-login page gives a 404 error unless you include special extra parameters. It's intentional. 
** Makes sense! The WP IndieAuth plugin might need to be updated to account for other login filenames
**I turned off the Indieauth plugin and added  <link rel="authorization_endpoint"... to my homepage <head> and now I can authenticate using Github. As said in chat, I much prefer it this way, fewer plugins=better.
