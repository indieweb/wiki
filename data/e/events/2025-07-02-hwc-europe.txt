{{benji}} says hi from an airplane :)
{{zachary.kai}} An airplane? How on earth do you have wifi? How cool!
{{benji}} waiting for takeoff. Dont think this plane has wifi. We'll see.
{{zachary.kai}} Makes sense then! Hope you have a safe flight!
Have a safe flight, {{benji}}! Have a good cup of coffee on the plane! +1 safe travels!

* Optimising for writing vs. publishing
* "local first" [[local_first]]
* Mobile writing flows
* Al did a demo showing a website in an iCloud-mounted folder that can be edited from his phone
* many folks do similar notes handling [[Obsidian]] with Obsidian

Al asked "does anyone feel organized with their thoughts?"
* James sharing his Notion setup 
** Similar to James' pastebin: https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/
** For me {{artlung}} I have several places I capture thoughts and as long as they are reliably saved and I regularly return to them I feel fine about it. Any effort I've ever made to centralize all my thoughts - in a single paper notebook, a single whiteboard, a single txt file has failed because I am not always in the same place and am not always with the same computer--So I must be content with several spots. The key for productivity is to add planned projects to my own calendar.
** Thomas uses https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-strange-new-worlds with Obsidian

* Zachary shared https://www.rssrssrssrss.com/ today and it's great. It allows combining rss feeds into new unique feeds.

* "jots" for notes on your website that are short, like one-liners
** Example: https://zacharykai.net/jots

* Thomas did a deep dive into his local notes setup with Obsidian
* Thomas has a feature in his notes that shows a [0] icon with the number of pages that link to the anchor
* "Solar" - related to a color scheme significant enough to have a wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized
* iAWriter: https://ia.net/writer

* What is the most creative page on your website?
