* [https://lynx.invisible-island.net Lynx Web Browser home page] a reminder to check your sites in a text browser! 

== Notes ==
* To Study list is great! [[Front_End_Study_Hall]]

== Animated SVG! ==
* Joe sharing - https://koaning.io/posts/svg-gifs/ an SVG that works like a GIF using https://asciinema.org
* https://koaning.io/posts/svg-gifs/parrot.svg - let's inspect it!
** has animation-duration, you could adjust animation play state
** Does NOT use animate, animateMotion or animateTransform nodes in the SVG, rather it uses a style element with a keyframe based animation 
** could a scrubber bar be created for this animation?
** how would this be made accessible?
** could you add audio in some way?
* brings to mind the late [https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/ SMIL] was tried

== Corner Style: Explored! ==
* Looking at Chrome based corner shaping with CSS - https://codepen.io/amit_merchant/pen/MYyaJOX
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipse
** many of the CSS corner shapes are based on superellipse** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/superellipse
** You might say that every corner-style is a kind of superelljpse!

<pre>@keyframes hyper {
 from {
   corner-shape: superellipse(-infinity);
 }
 to {
   corner-shape: superellipse(infinity);
 }
}</pre>

* Result in Chrome:
[[File:animated-corner-shape.gif|Animated Corner Shape of superelljpse]]
* ''"The button is breathing"''
* corner-shape is only available in Chrome (and Edge) as of this meeting but slated to make it to other browsers in time

* The "Get Gemini" button in Chrome can be unpinned

== Animation Notes ==
* Firefox includes a mechanism to adjust the curve of the animation timing function https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/linear-timing-function/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/animation-timing-function
* https://medium.com/@bruno.mazza87/the-12-principles-of-animation-and-css-1492cc7c41a7
* https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/linear-timing-function/
* Joe has been using animation-play-state on :hover to control animation playback

== Hooray Interns! ==
* shape outside devtool was added to Firefox by an Intern

== Reminder: "canidev.tools" website ==
* https://www.canidev.tools/
** Great site that shows how to accomplish development tasks in the dev tools of various browsers

== Elsewise ==
* Eric submitted a PR to improve NetNewsWire for a theme to help distinguish links
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1140307/what-are-the-valid-html-tags-in-rss-feeds/79829913
** a couple of very solid links on this from 2003

* to do this well, use leaflet.js - https://leafletjs.com/
* Joe trying to share - https://openseadragon.github.io
** Crashed his browser and his Mac and he was dropped from the call

** Joe uses Firefox for exploring dev tools because their tools have proven more reliable on his machine

** UK maps of radio coverage maps
** enormous GIF file with few colors, and all compositived over using Leaflet
** OpenStreetMap
** mix-blend-mode: multiply could be, or simply with transparency and layers you get nice 
** Leaflet testimonial from Kevin Marks
