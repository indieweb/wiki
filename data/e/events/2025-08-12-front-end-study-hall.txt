== Notes ==
* Joe's Zoom background today? A screenshot via a bluesky account called "[https://bsky.app/profile/classicweb.site/ classicweb.site]" 
** [https://bsky.app/profile/classicweb.site/post/3lvya76bnj6p2 SASS website from 2012]
** It doesn't look so different today: [https://sass-lang.com sass-lang.com]
** SASS implemented ideas for variables, color functions, flow control logic (<code>if</code>) long before we had similar implementations in browsers
** see also: [[Sass]]
** Eric M is using SASS recently - many - not finding identifiers that are there because they are created with nesting and concatenation via nesting and the <code>&</code> character 
** nesting is new
** @media blocks for selector

* What's on your mind? What HTML and CSS are you loving or are vexing you these days? ==

== HTML Day ==
* HTML Day on August 2 2025 was a lot of fun! https://html.energy/
** What did you make on HTML Day?
** I made a collective noun generator https://nouns.website

== Michael's Sun ==
** Animated sun: https://codepen.io/kupietz/pen/zxvdPEV
** Shadowcasting: https://codepen.io/kupietz/pen/LEpzJgL
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame
** showed it on a page showing text shadows on individual 
** intersectionobserver to add shadows only on the viewport
** other ways to do it? every words a span feels heavy
** how abotu a copy of all the text 

== Animation technique - skeleton to HTML structure ==
* https://miocene.io/post/css-character-skeleton/
** Stair dismount (ragdoll physics)

== Tiny Awards.net ==
FYI: https://tinyawards.net/vote/ are open for voting for finalists!
* We've not checked out the sites

== Question: Making WebVTT work? ==
* WebVTT: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API
** Didn't work in browser, maybe because it was a file://

== Ghost 6.0 ==
* Sophia: Ghost 6.0 - breaking changes?
* PDX HTML Day - collective nouns random generator - 
* https://nouns.website/ collective noun!
* Migrate all GitHub to Codeberg (?)
** [[Codeberg]]
** [[GitLab]] another option

== Alternatives to Zoom? ==
** [[Jitsi]] mixed experience in the past with IndieWeb events, though years ago

== Fighting AI ==
* HTML Bomb: https://www.neuralab.net/creative-defense-against-ai-crawlers-from-labyrinth-to-html-bombs/
* people with websites have been hit in the face and been obliged to upgrade infrastructure to deal with ai traffic because so many are poorly behaved - a natural consequence of that is that people seek solutions to punch back when punched in the face

== HTML Question - forms ==
* When should we use fields and legend?
** fieldset https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/fieldset
** legend https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/legend
** optgroup https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/optgroup
** Basically? to provide landmarks for screenreader in forms with multiple form elements as a help to navigation (skip an area, go area by area)

* Tetralogical is making an effort to see how different screen readers support and parse various HTML
** See this git repository https://github.com/TetraLogical/screen-reader-HTML-support
** 

== Elsewise ==
* Sophia updated to Ghost 6 and is looking to understand handlebars - https://docs.ghost.org/themes
* Privacy Policy? Ghost (commenting) - turfing it to Ghost (?)
** [[disclosure]] has some IndieWeb examples
* What do we owe our users? What moral accounting for what we collect?

== Blaugust and personal connections ==
* Blaugust and other blogging challenges
** [[Blaugust]]
** https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/
** [[NaBloPoMo]]
** [[challenge]]

* Permanence and connection and personal connectiion is in contrast to tracking and the negative parts of the web stack

== CSS, Comics, Microsoft Comic Chat ==
* https://nathan.com/ixd-blast-from-the-past-6-comic-chat/
* https://comicss.art/comics/190/
* Comics and CSS intersection

* Also Joe: ''"I'm not sure I'm an artist"'' :D
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target
** Experimenting with using this on my page https://artlung.com/art/ when targeting an individual piece's #hash as in  https://artlung.com/art/#unbought-unbossed
