[https://youtu.be/g8IVI0sZ6F8?si=F9gRipI3bOHcYMZQ Good news everyone!] We can stay at our current meeting at LEONARDO for one or two more months.

Max build a little tool to collect data from various sources ([[Letterboxd]], [[DayOne]] etc.) via RSS and create text/[[Markdown]] files which get imported in [[Obsidian]]. There he can create Dataview queries that show all the things he did on a specific day in recent years. This also allows him to preserve his data [[PESOS]]-style. {{bjoern}} is reminded of the [https://github.com/egoexpress/sifttter-redux-known/ Sifttter tool] which made similar things using [[IFTTT]] and some Ruby magic to create posts for [[Known]]. He plans to pick up the work on this tool to get all his data into [[Obsidian]] as well.

Max also added EXIF information when hovering over the images in his [https://www.maxhaesslein.de/visual/photography/moments/2025/ Moments gallery] and he created a [[Doodle]] "clone" called "[https://github.com/maxhaesslein/terminfinder Terminfinder]" as a self-hosted online meeting scheduling tool for his D&D sessions.

He also shared some interesing websites (see links below).

Tilman shared works of some of his design students who created their first web sites. 12 people managed to have their own website incl. domains online. He collected all his efforts and the collaboration with web hoster Hetzner at https://join-the-web.net/.

We talked about adding an event to the [https://nuernberg.digital/ Nürnberg Digital Festival event] in July. We plan to move our regular meeting to July 2nd and hope to attract some people there. Sebastian will add an event through their website.
