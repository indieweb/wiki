== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!

=== Discussion Points ===

==== Community ====

* "twitter-friend" equivalent = "personal website friend"!
* HWC = connecting with people and commuunity!
* The best part of the community is the diverse perspectives which keeps it thriving
* The 'indie web' thriving without necessarily being 'IndieWeb'
* Fun part of HWC: everyone brings their own ideas and backgrounds and expertise and knowledge!
* Short posts with responses to others' posts are a perfectly valid way to collect cool posts, interact with others, and build community!

=== Designs & Re-Designs ====

* Talking not just about building blocks but as an expression for interests
* Having a list of features that one wants to build that pushes from year-to-year
* "Comparison is the thief of joy"
* You can give a website the feeling of an end
** A hard part of designing something is deciding not just what you want to do but actually doing it
* How to redesign your website without redesigning it from scratch
** Don't redesign the whole thing -- do part of it! Maybe pick a single post and make it different.
** Creating a 'playground' or 'lab' subdomain or mini site to do design experiments
* One approach is forcing yourself to maintain one overarching theme and make small adjustments
* Some sites do one-off designed pages
** https://pudding.cool only does one-off pages for their long-form data journalism
* Building a website is a way to care too much about too little and have fun with it

==== URL Design ====

* Briefly the SEO community thought that www. improved your rank in search
* no-www is nicer -- the URL is shorter!

=== What We Did On Our Websites This Year! ===

==== General Comments ====

* "Too much!
* Maybe next year will be the year of doing more on our websites :D
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/::marker
* https://webkit.org/blog/17320/submit-your-ideas-for-interop-2026/ (deadline has now passed)

==== {{mandaris}} ====

* Rolled out a new theme on his website
* Proud of learning from and developing existing theme (And not deleting everything and starting from scratch)
* Interesting to think and talk about technologies
* Getting RSS feeds working properly! -- thankful for that
* Started by thinking his website was feature-complete; don't need to make any changes.
** Now has a few branches in git with a new theme, things he wants to work on; constantly inspired.

==== {{alabut}} ====

* Al: attending IndieWebCamp San Diego
** That's where and when I feel like I can see a big milestone: being "feature complete" with IndieWeb building blocks (Micropub, microformats, etc)
** Hibernating for a few months! HWC was a chance to engage with the community!
** Tale of three acts: did nothing during move, started joining HWCs this summer and spending more time thinking about photos, hosted photo pop up and joining IWC SD.
** Resolution: hopes to host a pop up a month next year! "The gift of community"
** Joined Create Day! -- enjoyed making things, and the "after party rave vibe" after the event.
** Take-away from session on the future of the IndieWeb at IWC SD: human side of the IndieWeb, and how much the community is thriving without it being #IndieWeb. micro.blog uses the tech but isn't positioned as "IndieWeb"
* Resolution: Not waiting for HWC to look at people's websites!

==== Ricardo ====

* Launching his website!
* Supposed to be a portfolio site but ended up becoming more personal
* Learning about and using Notion embeds and owning bookmarks that were in Notion
* Learning about Tumblr embed; has ideas to explore that aren't live yet

==== {{vanderwal}} ====

** Updating back-end of website from PHP 5.6 to 8.3, which had been in the works for ~3 years start-stop.
** This year was finally the year to finish the work; it was 1-2 weeks to do.
** In making changes, updated back-end admin tools -- allows editing posts rather than going into DB to edit, built paginated category pages and doing more updates.
** Created Lab space to play with layouts. Last thing in there is to start playing with blog search within his own blog so he can more easily find tihngs. Two more updates coming then it will come to the blog, maybe a project for the next few years.
** Coming back to the IndieWeb after dipping in and out over the years!
** "There's a whole lot of activity. I need time to catch up!" -- this year was a time to catch up.
* Posting on the web started as a way to find people to have conversations with: there's something awesome about how sites can lead people to connect

==== James ====

* Grateful for more people starting things and doing events.
* "Everyone is doing cool things"
* Starting an ideas list to take pressure off the concept of 'must-dos'
** https://jamesg.blog/ideas-list
* Proud of his new homepage design and learning more about design
** Being more visual, adding more images, 
** The homepage both references and mentions Taylor Swift (as it should!)
* Created a gallery page and it's linked in the menu now
* Hoping to do more visual things on the site next year: grids, galleries, paintings, art
* https://jamesg.blog/search-pages?q=has:design
* James' personal goals this year: https://jamesg.blog/2025-goals

==== {{pjg1}} ====

* No goals for 2025, just an ongoing list of "would-be-nice-to-build" features that keeps moving from year to year
* Constant urge to redesign my website - I just want to write sometimes!
* Interested in contributing more to the community!
* Introduced to 'linkposts' and wishes had been introduced sooner
* Learning flexibility about what can constitute a 'post'

==== Jo ====

* Made https://dead.garden/blog/2025-in-review.html as her year in review
* "Gothic yet modern" - Zachary's description of Jo's website
* Enjoyed redesigning the website without doing everything again: took design on the website and asked "how can I make this monochrome?"
* Enjoyed Joe's root colour property bookmarklet to change and test out new 

==== Tantek ====

* How to make a test case:
    ** Write up how you expect the spec to work for a specific element (e.g. the marker CSS for styling list bullets & numbers)
    ** Take screenshots of how the various browsers render 
    ** Document the variations (e.g. Safari for list items)
* Upgrade to PHP 8 broke a few things; unclear why footnotes broke.
** Encouragement: unless you have a specific reason to upgrade, consider whether you need to.
* Started to build out content-centric top-level named pages, like https://tantek.com/daylists
** /daylists is a h-feed that you can follow; a chance to experiment -- CSS was just for that one page. You don't need to redesign your whole website to experiment.
** [[Falcon#named_pages]] lists pages Tantek made (i.e. https://tantek.com/appearances)
* Still has a pbwiki; thinking about wiki-like functions on website. This year decided to make static HTML pages without CSS to represent some content. It doesn't matter if it has revision history, etc, for it's on Tantek's website rather than a silo.
* {{alabut}} - the goal of renaming "Slash Pages" to something more universal is good. "Named Page" still needs too much decoding; how about "One Off Pages" or "Standalone Pages"?
* Hoping to make IWC Dusseldorf and Nurnberg happen!

== Morgan ==

* Theme of next year is relaxation; finding a better balance between the online/offline. Working on website as a relaxed thing.
* Hoping to stop posting to silos / give up on posting to LinkedIn; LinkedIn is mentally taxing.
* End of 2025: finally breaking up with social media. Mentally detaching rather than completely leaving.

== Sophia ==

* Continue writing on https://toground.link
* Cleaning up migration from WordPress to Ghost
* Cleaning up a few things on fractialkitty.com
** "What's important to have in my navigation?"
* Has experimental journal in a Numbers spreadsheet file -- hoping to create a zine based on the experiment. Next question: now what?
* https://streamof.me made by Sophia!
* Hopes to bring back haiku practice and integrate it into a website

== Things We're Grateful For This Year ==

* Piya: Finding HWC! (via Mastodon, and seen mentions of the IndieWeb before!)
** Started creating link posts w/ links and a bit of commentary.
* Sophia: Enjoyed good morning Slacks, live espresso streaming, coffee blogs, all of the above. Grateful for the IndieWeb Carnivals!
** Exploration/experimentation with websites has been exciting / fun -- discussions and community around that has been fun!
