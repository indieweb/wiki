* [[calibre]]
* https://calibre-ebook.com/ 
* https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/news.html Supports RSS, so you could subscribe to various feeds, schedule downloads at specific times, and have it exported as an Ebook. That way you can have something like the "Morning" or "Evening" paper. This is great if you want to read blogs / news but want to do so offline. Also, works best with websites / publishers who publish full posts in their feed.
* https://joinbookwyrm.com/ : federated, ActivityPub
** Searches OpenLibrary and Inventaire (https://inventaire.io/) when adding titles
*** https://github.com/benjifs/sparkles/blob/main/src/functions/providers/books/inventaire.js
** Self-hosting BookWyrm: great for "Own Your Data", not great for discovering new books
** OPML as a lightweight way to publish reading lists & books on your site? https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/01/federated-bookshelves-obsidian-notes-to-opml/
