** Source https://github.com/kupietools/BS-Detector
** Note: Angelo asked about changing the search engines, and I just remembered, the search engines are not specified in the PHP code, but in the Google Custom Search Engine setup on Google. So to change the sites searched, you need to set up your own GCSE and replace it in the code.
