== Participants ==
* {{artlung}}
* {{mat.tl}}
* {{kevinmarks}}
* {{t}}
* (and a few other folks who found their way via Eric Meyer's retoot on Mastodon)

== Notes ==
* Joe's Zoom background today is from the website for David Siegel's Creating Killer Websites - which in 1996 was state of the art - which at the time meant <nowiki><FONT></nowiki> and <nowiki><TABLE></nowiki> tags and spacer GIFs to push what was possible on the web.

== Modern browser features and Ruby on Rails  ==
* {{mat.tl}} ran current Ruby on Rails this past weekend and was asked whether the frontend stack should use more modern features, some were familiar, some weren't:
* :has()
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has
** Bruce Lawson calls it "The God Selector" https://brucelawson.co.uk/2024/css-has-the-god-selector/
* CSS Nesting
** CSS Nesting https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting
** Previously only available in LESS, CSS syntax in many environments can use a nested syntax
* "Import Maps"
** A way to point to namespaced JavaScript modules
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap
** https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#import-maps
** Akin to source maps https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Source_map
* "Badging"
** Might be referring to the Badging API https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Badging_API

== For the next FrESH == 
* Goal for next FRESH for {{artlung}} make :has based navigation a11y compliant (with ARIA-?) for https://lab.artlung.com

== Misc Topics, What's up with an abbreviations? ==
* Why is a11y abbreviated like that?
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility has an answer
** It's less characters to type
** Some find it an unhelpful abbreviation

== I have a static site, how do I add search? How do I find things within my site as it grows? ==
* Use a widget from a popular search engine
* e.g. Google https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create
* Community member {{capjamesg}} has wrotten about his own site and search engine https://jamesg.blog/2021/07/20/building-a-blog-search-engine/
* Consider other means to help navigate, an index page with all your 

* Very much in the vein of a [[digital garden]], yes, sites expand, get unwieldly, but can evolve over time, this is something of a natural growth of using websites like a journal, like a diary, like a notebook, like a scientist's records

** Joe is not discovering radium, but is discovering/improving radial gradients?
* {{kevinmarks}} points out that Twitter at one time had an export that. included a JavaScript based search that did not require any sort of backend server technology
* SQLite based search?
* Fuzzy Find Riprep - editor - Vim, Sublime Text style codes
* Joe uses phpStorm, BBedit, PyCharm
* Our own editors or operating systems can be helpful to search our own site
* Tools like Obsidian or Scrivener can search across a corpus on a local machine

== Aside on Debugging ==

** https://store.wizardzines.com/products/poster-debugging-manifesto

== About consistency in browser rendering ==
* MSIE / CSS Gradient - hacks in CSS
** Browser consistency is far better these days
** <nowiki>-moz-, -webkit- prefixes</nowiki> cruft
** things like {{t}}'s [http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html Box Model hack] are thankfully no longer state of the art when <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> is now widely available
** Should I worry about nesting of my HTML code?
** What code formatting matters? How do we take in. reactions and criticism of others?
** Adam Bosworth on his time in the MSIE team: [https://artlung.com/blog/2020/02/19/adam-bosworths-talk-at-2005-mysql-users-conference/#t00h06m17s ''"we will render" no matter what'']

== Misc ==

* Happy New Year FrESH! ðŸ¥³
* how to publish and represent opening hours for venues in the context of recommendations
* some background here: https://chat.indieweb.org/2025-01-02#t1735811146863500
* venue owners find it hard to update more than place
* people trust individuals more than larger services for more precise information
** https://chat.indieweb.org/2025-01-02#t1735811566445500

* Representing time intervals or any human construct comes. with limitations
** https://www.xkcd.com/2867/
** opening hours based on sunset
** park signs that say it is open until sundown
** business hours - perceived complexity, actual complexity

== And. more on standards and their power ==
* There's no standard way for a buisiness to represent their operating hours in a way search engines and sites like yelp can consume, a la a robot.txt file?
** how/why is moving a text file from one computer to another more perhaps technically different than signing into (creating accounts on) multiple sites / services and updating them via forms
** anil dash's statement about "wherever you get your podcasts" is only true because Apple forced people to use an open RSS podcast standard for their dominant podcast tools / directory. see: https://www.anildash.com//2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/
** counter-example: Google Reader's shut down affecting the feeds/RSS ecosystem

** RSS is powerful and portable - Joe saw a podcast that went quiet for years then 8-9 year then published a new episode! https://alifewellwasted.com/
** counter-example: tuaw(.)com being taken over by a gen AI spammer, took weeks for Christina Warren to get people to notice and get tuaw slop feeds taken down by Google News

== Thanks all for coming to the first IndieWeb event of 2025! ==
