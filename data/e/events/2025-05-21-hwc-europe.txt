* Keeping your DNS host and domain registrar may be advantageous from a security perspective
** An attacker could only get into one thing at once
** Switching cost is also lower: if your domain goes up / your domain registar becomes problematic / any other reason, you can move without having to change your DNS. And vice versa.

Bug report for webmention.io! It doesn't support detecting u-like-of h-cite properly! (it's supposed to use the u-url inside the h-cite)
* https://artlung.com/likes/923b8a5dec6db81dda6488c3ba5092a4 has u-like-of h-cite element and actual URL inside:
** <nowiki><span class="h-cite u-like-of"><a class="u-url h-cite" href="https://tantek.com/2025/120/t1/indieweb-movie-club-tomorrowland"></nowiki>

* It should be recorded that the meeting has gone into a long, passionate digression about the proper order to watch Star Wars movies and shows in. I leave it to the participants to note here if they feel the details of the convo are worth preserving beyond that.
