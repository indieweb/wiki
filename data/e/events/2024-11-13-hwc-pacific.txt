* Self-hosted codepen alternative: https://github.com/porsager/flems/ 
By default requires you to include a script from their server, to run it completely locally requires doing `npm build run` to generate the script file (which in {{kupietz}}'s case took reading error messages to figure out how to install needed dependencies and get some things updated). Runs totally in-browser, no server connection after it loads... will even work loading it offline as a file:// URL. [UPDATE: No, looking at the code, it looks like for some things, like typescript or using babel, it might rely on libraries hosted on flems.io. Drat.]
