== Notes ==
* pitch for developers to use micropub versus ActivityPub / mastodon
** micropub is simpler
** micropub fails better (summary)
** micropub does more than mastodon -- mastodon just does notes, micropub does a lot of post types
* mastodon is ready to join version of ActivityPub, do we have equivalent for micropub?

* mastodon (and social media) -- getting more than like ~100 replies is not useful, get lots of duplication
** large language model identify duplicate responses and group them?
** reddit as example of solving redundancy issue -- chain instead of repetition -- but relies on reading and equivalent visibility (vs. mastodon you don't necessarily see all existing replies)
* engagement via mastodon spread over longer time frame than Twitter?
