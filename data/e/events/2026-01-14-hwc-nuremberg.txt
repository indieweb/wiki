Tilman created a new [[digital garden]] as part of his web presence at https://tilman.me/garden/Welcome. In there he tries to collect his knowledge and research on how creative practitioners can reclaim the web by running their own independent websites. He collects this input in an [[Obsidian]] vault and uses Obsidian Publish to get this info on the web.

As he struggles a bit with writing English text about this topic in his own voice, he used an [[LLM]] as a writing assistant. He tried out [[ChatGPT]], but Claude is much better suited for this task. He doesn't want to lose his own writing voice, though, so he drafts his own thoughts first and then enters a discussion with Claude to create an outline and uses Claude to create a full text of the content afterwards. There was a bit of discussion about the role of the LLM in the whole process and whether to make the information that an LLM was used public.

He created a lot of content regarding alternative web movements like HTML Energy, Poetic Web (and [[IndieWeb]] of course). He wants this to become the website he wanted to have for himself 5 years ago.

Alex had a site to keep track of the books he read. He re-created the whole web page in Figma and asked for design input. The web pages uses [[webauthn]], so we had a bit of talk about this technology and its support on different platforms and operating systems. Alex uses horizontal and vertical scrolling in a mix, and there were mixed reactions if this is feasible and makes the website usable.

René was laid off yesterday and wants to set up a portfolio website to apply for new jobs. For this he doesn't only want to focus on his previous work experience, but also include his private interests and hobbies to show his full personality. Examples are:

* a project where he bought a cheap toy electronic keyboard an hacked it to hook it up to some other musical equipment
* a physical self-built clock device with a day gradient display
* a completely self-designed and self-built plotter

He wanted to setup and easy web page, but was appalled by Squarespace templates and their generic layout. He then used Figma to design the page and asked for input, which sparked a lively discussion.

In the end Philip showed a quick demo about how he implemented Fast Fourier Transformation on the web. The demo requests access to the microphone and displays a waveform of the input.
