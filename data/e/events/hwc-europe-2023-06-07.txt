* Site indexes
** https://capjamesg.github.io/index/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model
* ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0241374238 = Index, A History of the: A Bookish Adventure (includes a  nice example of a computer generated index vs human generated one)
* How to do the subcategories in index
** topic modeling - genism is one of the python libary that is both relativly easy to use and has relativly understandable output: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ (has been a about two years, since I used it for the last time)
** bag of words - will most likely not work because the topics are too different
** AI - though getting the ChatGPT to return standardized output is hard
** BERT
First website: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
* http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proposal.html
* A discussion about the index.html and the directory index and if the index on website has anything to do with the directory index-es
* https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/library/thesis_abstracts/ProjProgReptsMSc15/Francois-Christophe-Progress-Report.pdf
* Doing the multi-language glossaries (the purpose to not have to define the terms in each blog post each time)
** First idea: media wiki
*** media wiki can be a bit anoying to update - but the recent versions of the PHPs are not really breaking changes, so updating PHP versions had become easier
** Other possibilities: blog posts with automatic translation, having both langauges on the same page,...
** Looking for a solution, that does not require PHP knowledge - no getting hacked because of the lack of knowledge
** See: [[language]]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:GB
* Fires in the Spain and Canada
** The reason for fires is a good example of how users can be 'stupid' - putting the barbacue do-it-yourself in the dry glass
* Japanese KitKat and Japanese candies (can be graphic - no explanation provided)
* Different cultures/countires have different tastes for chocolate
** US have butyric acid in the chocolate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qWl9Dlts5g (is this anti-US propaganda?)
** animals in the chocolate?
* Being the QI audience - virtual during covid - other shows also did it this way
* Robot Wars - the UK version
* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid
* Chase quiz show
* Big Brother / Dead set
* Exhibition of the history of Punk - can be inspiration for the personal site https://rageandrevolution.co.uk/
** cut-and-paste (one could get high on the spray)
* Reddit - they will require payment for the API
** SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) - Reddit did the blackout in protest
** Now subreddits will go on the blackout against reddit
** Official Reddit app is horrible, but they canabilized the web version for it
** Lemy - activity pub based reddit alternative
** Discord - no cohesion between the answer and question - Reddit has this better, since you can see the train of tought
*** How to surface the best info - StackOverflow does this quite well, how does Twitter does this?
* Writing blog posts
** There is a difference in writting different types of posts - for example personal is easier then technical
* Pictures/illustration can also represent the current you
** What to have as a picture
** Using garden-like icons if one wants to change their side to a digital garden
* Scaning the phisical pictures to create a design for the website
** Is this not done anymore because of the performance reasons?
** Do personal websites need to worry about performance?
** Personal sites are easily more performant simply just because it does not as many adds and metrics
** Other people opinion can also constrain the thinking of what to put in the website (PNG vs. SVG - but PNG can be more performant in some cases)
* HTTP3
* MHTML https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML 
* Badges on GitHub + timeline
* KPIs can drive weird functionality
** Engagement - GitHub timeline
* When did people stop designing their own buttons?
