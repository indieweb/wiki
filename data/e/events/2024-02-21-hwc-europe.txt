'''404 pages''' 
* New 404 page with text adventure game by {{lazcorp}} - https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/404
* inspiration: https://www.thesistersofmercy.com/error404page.html
* My favorite text adventure https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior

'''Apple in the EU'''
* I first was made aware of this from this post https://adactio.com/journal/20888 

'''Other HTTP Response pages'''

{{sarajaksa}} is blocking scrapers with a static text file asking to contact with reasons
* I was worried if the message is condescending to the user
* The message for search engines/AI: https://sarajaksa.eu/error/403-scraping.txt
* The message for non-descriptive User-Agent: https://sarajaksa.eu/error/403-scraping-learning.txt
* Advice: make sure you are more explicit about what I would accept and how to contact me + to contact me if there is an error and I should not be blocking you
* Webmention user agent "may" for senders: https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/#sender-discovers-receiver-webmention-endpoint
* Open source library for retrieving the webmention endpoint of a source uses curl, without an explicit useragent:
