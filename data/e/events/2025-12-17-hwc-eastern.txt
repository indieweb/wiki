** Morgan is enjoying writing about accessibility
** Friend who is not sighted was bemused 

* David and Joe both have only been in an airport in Tokyo, but almost certainly not the same one and also decades apart.

* {{rossabaker}} is fighting SameSite cookie policies and OAuth redirects

* Japanese-style egg salad sandwiches are in California and in the UK 
* Random fact of the day: 7-Eleven is a Japanese company

* Manny is working on his [[Hugo]]  site to add a site search
** Process generates a large json file (an index, presumably?)
** "mini search" 
** Naty has used "Pagefind" successfully ~ https://github.com/Pagefind/pagefind
** It is simple to use, can exclude pages (e.g. terms/taxonomy hugo pages) and easy to customize output, gets the database of all words on build during deployment so index stays fresh
** Manny also has been leaning on with Picalilli  - https://piccalil.li - for front end insights
*** "Why are my view-transitions blinking" https://piccalil.li/blog/why-are-my-view-transitions-blinking/

* Thomas working on his site search and running into complicated database issues

** https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=GitHub+actions
* #GiveupGithub: https://giveupgithub.org/
** Naty left GitHub (Pages hosting) to SourceHut CI (Builds) and separate static hosting https://burgeonlab.com/blog/migrate-github-pages-to-sourcehut-bunny/
** There's also Codeberg Pages, which has a hazy future: https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/

* App Stores in the Apple Ecosystem and Google Ecosystems often have onerous requirements for publishing software, whether that's:
** Browser plugin for Chrome
** Browser plugin for Safari
** Android app for phone
** "social media apps" - indieweb software falls into this category and so has even greater "regulatory" overhead
