== Notes ==
* Welcome! How are you faring today?
* Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws
* Three Laws of Robotics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics

* API calls are a kind of incantation, yes (see Clarke's 3 laws, above)
* Speaking of aphorisms about technology, I like Heinlen's quote: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12051-a-human-being-should-be-able-to-change-a-diaper  
“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.”
