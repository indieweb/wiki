* blogging or not blogging about politics
** what is politics?
** some topics are purely political, some people can't not be political (ie. identity questions like a trans person)
*** some things are considered inherently political and others inherently apolitical 
** it's not only Â« vote for X Â». trying to explain why i vote for someone / trying to get more general about the concepts and not that one candidate on a given day
** alex has 2 rules: 1/ don't write about Â« perishable Â» topics 2/ try to keep things general
** James: it's about optimism and hope, you're not a news organisation

* James: what do I do about a post from a year or so ago that is very dear to me and that people might never see because they're lost in the archives?
** Jo (garden): pinned posts, you could have a pinned post with your personal top 10
** example: https://jvns.ca/categories/favorite/
** Cory Doctorow had a great piece yesterday that speaks to the question of older posts. https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/21/noway-back-machine/#retro Rsurrecting posts from this day in history brings it to mind for Cory and also exposes it to everyone else. 
I don't write every day, but whenever I post I look at the other posts from that day and sometimes I will either add a short note linking to that or even share the original socially even though it is not new.
** "Now" pages [[Now]] 
** WP/CP plugin to surface related posts using a flexible algorithm; I was impressed https://yarpp.com/
** Jeremy Keithâ€™s website has a â€˜Previously on this dayâ€™ on article pages So does mine ðŸ™Œ!
** Alex uses Tempus Fugit (used to use yarpp) on Wordpress to have a Â« on this day Â» box in the sidebar
** James also has his time machine: https://jamesg.blog/time-machine/
*** I find on this day's personally delightful: I just had a nice memory by looking at my time machine.
