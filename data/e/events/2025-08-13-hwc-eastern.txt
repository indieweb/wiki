* https://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/typecasting-revisited/ "Typecasting" was the aegis under which Mark Simonson wrote about anachronistic typography in film (Here's a coincidenceâ€”in one postscript, Simonson credits an old client of Kupietz's, for the topic of an article: https://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/not-a-font/ I've known Bill S. for a long time.)

* {{rossabaker}} added a locations taxonomy, which is still half-baked: https://rossabaker.com/locations
** There seems to be partial support for hierarchies, but weird cases around the edges.
** /locations/us, /locations/us/indiana, and /locations/us/indiana/indianapolis work out of the box
** /locations generates an entry for country, state, *and* city
