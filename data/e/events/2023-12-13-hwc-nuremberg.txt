Sebastian showed his web site optimizations based on Max' article (https://www.maxhaesslein.de/notes/performant-images-on-the-web/). This pushed his web site from a C in the [https://www.websitecarbon.com/ Website Carbon Calculator] to an A. For now, he creates the WebP images by hand.

Sebastian then shows his IWC display made in the FabLab, powered by a Caliope controller.

Klaus wants to start a web page, so we discuss a bit which tools to use. He thinks about generating static HTML pages, which he wants to upload by FTP. Most participants think it's best to start with the tool you are familiar and happy with and which gets you results the fastest. As Klaus already has a webspace available, [[Wordpress]] is a good option. [https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/issue-04/ Issue #4 of the OwnYourWeb newsletter] is mentioned, where [[User:matthiasott.com|Matthias Ott]] asked on Mastodon what tools people use to create their websites.

There is some further discussion about including dynamic content in static websites, from sites like Last.fm. Solutions like cronjobs which generate static pages are mentioned. 

There was some more chat about web-related issues and much gingerbread. :)
