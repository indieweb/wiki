*Webmention Etiquette & Display Discussion
** https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2024-05-29
*** "The webmention spec details how they work but not what one should do upon receiving them. A social norm needs to develop here so that those implementing them have a reasonable expectation as to their handling."
*** https://micro.blog/petebrown/38064609 -- Tracy's webmention went as a direct reply
*** {{gRegor}}: sounds like a bug in micro.blog interpreting replies incorrectly, I filed a micro.blog issue: https://github.com/microdotblog/issues/issues/265
*** recommendations document gathering what the community has learned about Webmentions -- what should people expect both building and using it
*** could be useful to have an indication that a comment was a webmention -- not distinguished from other comments
*** could post length be a cue to not display the entire text as a reply? or the post having a title?
*** mentions and replies should display differently
*** {{artlung}} example of a post which was webmentioned, but not a reply, to jeremy keith's post, and it seemed like rather more of the content (all of it) posted to adactio.com's than was expected - https://artlung.com/blog/2024/05/08/declarative-vs-imperative-programming/ https://adactio.com/articles/21110#comment108241

*Re: displaying comments (reply posts) from webmentions: [[comments]]
** If it's not a reply post, then technically the receiver shouldn't be processing/displaying it as a comment

* Avatar images displayed with webmentions and comments
** https://gravatar.com/ - associates image with an email address - WordPress native comments check email address for a Gravatar profile image

** Tracy and Joe, try <code>define( 'WEBMENTION_LOCAL_AVATAR_STORE', true );</code> in your wp-config.php
** saves a local copy of a webmention commenter's profile image
** XOXO Fest https://xoxofest.com/ more [[XOXO]]

* IndieWeb work parties to collectively make things
** This is the issue for modernizing the indiewebify.me codebase: https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82

* are there guidelines for developing *for* the IndieWeb community? e.g. deciding what language to use
* how to decide on the scope of the project?
** phase 1: migrate to modern framework
** phase 2: change content -- e.g. remove IndieMark / Levels
