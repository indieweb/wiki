THREE PROMPTS FOR TODAY

# What's new in websites?!
# What's new in *your* website?
# What are you hoping to change about your website?

=== Joe ===
* https://indieweb.thisbot.day/ (new bot with Mastodon and Bluesky editions, will post Mondays for upcoming events that week; semi-automated)
* Based on comments from {{rossabaker}} from last week I added a scanner to my site to the yaml files which I use to pull in metadata for some of the ad-hoc pages on my site to notify me when I use an invalid 
* https://artlung.com/blog/2004/02/02/107578570668362655/
* Added myself to [[NetNewsWire#IndieWeb_Examples]] 

=== Manny ===
* is playing with JPEG XL
** https://jpegxl.info
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XL
** https://caniuse.com/jpegxl
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types
** Example post: https://mandarismoore.com/2026/01/14/a-test-of-jpeg-xl/ 
*** CDN is returning Content-Type of application/octet-stream.  Returning image/jxl would be ideal here.
*** ... which doesn't help if the browser doesn't support it.  But might help if it does!

=== Reilly ===
* is wrestling with 2 spaces after a period
* Unicode spaces: https://jkorpela.fi/chars/spaces.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character#Unicode
* CSS whitespace controls: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/white-space

=== Ana ===
* Knows MySpace from 20 years ago!
* Uses [[micro.blog]]
* Appreciates the Indieweb Carnival prompts! [[indieweb_carnival]]
* https://anaolivia.micro.blog/cycles-and-fluctuations/

=== Naty ===
* Re: displaying webmentions
** Doesn't have any public facing display of webmention data (there is an Atom feed provided by webmention.io to keep track of who mentioned what)
** Because of this, a like/upvote button (iine) similar to Bearblog, was added to allow for simple interaction & display of appreciation (written a guide on it: (https://burgeonlab.com/blog/add-appreciation-buttons-to-hugo-with-iine/)
** There's a code by Carl Schwan that provides Mastodon comments that can be loaded with JS under posts if the post has been syndicated - works well on Hugo https://carlschwan.eu/2020/12/29/adding-comments-to-your-static-blog-with-mastodon/
* Finds out that https://webmention.io can still be used with https://getindiekit.com/ without changing the `link rel` in `head`
** The Indiekit server needs to be running (Render spins down the NodeJS app after 15m) and IndieLogin.com will request permission to be authorized by Indiekit then

* Multilingualism on the Web, recent IndieWeb carnival: https://tilde.team/~zinricky/multilingualism/

=== Various clubs ===
* [[indieweb_carnival]]
* [[movie_club]]
* [[IndieWeb_Book_Club]]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Club_(automotive)

=== micro.blog and likes ===
* does not support incoming likes; the webmention might show as received/processed, but won't appear anywhere within m.b.
** https://help.micro.blog/t/does-micro-blog-send-out-notices-for-u-like-of/2561
* m.b. does have an API to retrieve webmentions, but it does not appear to include these incoming-like webmentions (which makes sense)
** https://micro.blog/webmention
** Example API: https://micro.blog/webmention?target=https://anaolivia.micro.blog/2025/12/08/yesterday-i-joined-a-popup.html
* Webmention.io uses 'wm-property' field to indicate 'like', 'in-reply-to', etc.  https://github.com/aaroninto pk/webmention.io?tab=readme-ov-file#api
** A great service, though be careful if you want to use it on micro.blog because there might be issues in where webmentions go (m.b webmention endpoint vs wm.io endpoint). (iirc) Webmention senders will use the first discovered endpoint, so mentions might not go where you expect them to.
*** https://artlung.com/likes/27cffb3e3a994c6fc4f0446eadc41e80 is the like which I sent - it returned HTTP code 202 (Accepted) - but the body of the response is empty

=== unicode-range ===
* Ross implemented unicode-range for his font: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@font-face/unicode-range
** Problem: font has 43,451 glyphs, weighs 330kb.  Don't need most of them most of the time!
** Solution: split into multiple fonts.  One for Latin, one for math, one for Cyrillic, etc.
** Now, except for pages doing something weird, weighs in about 20kB!

=== Styling RSS feeds ===
* Reilly's stylesheet for RSS feeds: https://reillyspitzfaden.com/styles/rss-styles.xsl
** Looks like this: https://reillyspitzfaden.com/feed.xml
* [[XSLT]]

* HTTP/1.1 202 YEAH WHATEVER
* https://http.cat/202

* Reilly asking about running Caddy in Docker on a Hetzner box
** https://caddyserver.com
** Naty also uses Docker (newbie) and found the GUI of Portainer helped her grasp the settings a bit more than plain CLI Docker https://github.com/portainer/portainer

=== Morgan ===
* Whats new: https://www.morganwebdev.org/coffee-crawl/
2026 Website Edition TBD / in Progress

=== What's an Espresso 2.0 Livestream? ===
* {{tantek}} explained
* to mechanize the camera - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anybots

* Morgan wants reasons not to spend money on this: https://usgraphics.com/products/berkeley-mono
Fonts can be so appealling

* https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/

* Morgans current solution in Hugo to markdown rendering -> {{ rawhtml }} *html here*  {{ /rawhtml }} cant remember if I had to install it or not somehow, just a way to get some raw html on the pages.
* {{mandaris}} You can also set a configuration option. https://www.tzhwang.com/2021/08/28/enable-raw-html-in-hugo/
	[markup.goldmark.renderer]
	  unsafe= true
Double check with the Hugo configuration https://gohugo.io/configuration/markup/

* entities in doctypes are 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack
* "The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function", XML Edition
* https://artlung.com/likes/ - I have a few things I liked on micro.blog from Manny which when I send likes get a 202 back with an empty response.

=== Tantek ===
* {{t}} has created a personal site 88x31 button/badge using HTML+CSS and took a screenshot https://tantek.com/88x31x2.png
** Naty has seen people use these buttons on blogroll pages
** Her badge was created by a friend who does pixel art https://burgeonlab.com/images/web-badges/burgeonlab_badge.webp and has a collection of other buttons on the footer of her blog
** Having a 88x31x2 version is a good idea
