nested communities - subcommunities within larger communities
* e.g. micro.blog knitting channel nested within big picture community of people who don't like the silos
* what level community does change need to happen? 

we need to define a vision of a world that's clearly better than the silos

more micro.blog-esque places that aren't microblogging

In addition to adding visible webmentions to the wiki (maybe using Fluffy's mention.js script?), it would be nice to have a template added to all pages to add a list of internal backlinks from the wiki.
