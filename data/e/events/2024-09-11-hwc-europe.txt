* Newspaper columns on websites
* Guest posts could be an interesting idea
* Sending an email, like and webmention can be too much work or awoke the fears in us, even if the people want these emails
* Co-written posts
** There is more social steps involved, if somebody wants to remove the content, if it is not on otheir own site
** They can be published at the same time in both sites
** They could be co-write in the same document in a sync way
** Aggregation of responses could be interesting - everybody writting in the same place
** We could do it as the replies (like letter responses) on each sites
