=== Introductions + Anything Interesting You've Read Recently ===

* {{capjamesg}} - loves writing, the web, and is from Scotland. Just finished reading Walden after 
* Ana Olivia - new to the IndieWeb, joined in November last year. Started their microblog recently. Recieved a late Christmas gift: tales from the cafe book series and is excited to get back to reading and creative writing.
* {{tracydurnell}} - Tracy is from the Pacific Northwest. Recently read The Phsychology Of Writing about the process of making meaning. -- https://tracydurnell.com/2026/01/16/read-the-psychology-of-writing/
* {{sarajaksa}} - from Slovenia, and their favorite part of the recently read 2000 to 10,000 and Feminisim In The Wild, which discusses how the theory of society can influence how we describe nature.

* {{zacharykai}} is just taking notes and won't be participating via audio today. So talk away!

=== Discussion Openers ===

* Can start with an opening question, but will flow through various topics to keep the conversation going.

=== Writing Procsses & Inspiration ===

==== Forms & Consistency ====

* Different modes of writing for different forms: Sophia has a daily routine for her daily journal, and for more technical writing, she reminds herself regularly to complete the project, and for her second-person nature writing, she also has to remind herself to get back to it if she goes a month without writing it.
* What forces Sophia to come back to writing is not being able to stop thinking about it + consistent reminders.
* A daily writing routine is a great way to remind yourself of the other forms you engage in
* Sophia's daily journal is public, which is perhaps a method for accountability
* The beauty of sponteanatiy vs the comfort/ease of regimented schedules
* Writing habits as anchors: Tracy uses her weeknotes as such, and is experimenting with Sunday evening for finishing projects or expanding upon thoughts that've been coming up during the past week
* The process is the process, no matter how scattered or 'imperfect', as long as it works for you

==== Times & Schedules ====

* James often started writing after ~9pm but now writes more often in the morning 
* Daniel also used to write at night, and would write things in his head on the bike but they'd sometimes disappear as soon as he'd finish his ride
* Writing schedules shift as our lives and priorities change, and that's okay

==== Finishing Things + Editing ====

* Often things are easier to finish if you can complete the first draft in one sitting
* Does coming back to projects make it easier to edit or is it better to edit as one goes? 
* Stream-of-conciousness writing can often help with making a piece easier to finish
* 'Coming back to something with the memory of a goldfish' helps you look at a piece differently
* Publishing something is the best you can do at the moment. Is it true? Is this what I can thoughtfully present, even if it's not complete or the 'whole truth.'
* Finish the thought, it doesn't matter how long it takes, or even if you don't have all the answers.

==== Getting Inspired ====

* James often looks out the window in the mornings for inspiration and it's a good sign when coffee goes cold
* Taking a photo can be a useful visual you can use as a callback to write
* Writing often comes straight from the feelings: the editing mindset can get in the way of this
* Writing prompts or participating in carnivals is an excellent way to think of what to write, but it can sometimes feel like you don't know the answer or have enough to say
* Reading past diary or journal entries or blog posts: getting the thoughts or ideas from your previous self
* The best ideas or seedlings for a piece comes when the mind is at rest
* Write things down before you forget it, but don't feel you have to get the whole piece out now. An 'anchor' word to remember the larger point or concept can really help
* Lettting things cook on the mind's backburner
* 'Hooks' as reminders for writing: your favorite pencil where you can see it, taking photos
* A daily poetry-writing habit as a different way of looking at the world: useful and interesting for a writer
* "Thinking in Haikus" as a healthier frame of "thinking in tweets"
* Thinking deeply and widely instead of surface-level and lineraly helps you draw unexpected connections: like the prompt 'cycles and fluctiations' to realizing how the weather in your birthday month affects the experience
* Re-reading: vastly underrated. You're a different person every time you re-read a favorite.
* Recurrance: blog archives and revisiting past work for new retrospectives

==== Writing While On The Go ====

* A topic Ana Oliva wants to explore: writing via dictation while on the road on their dash cam. It's interesting to see how things they see when they're driving influence what they mention in their voice notes.
* Voice or video notes as processing a passing moment

=== Writing Forms ===

==== Experimentation ====

* Sometimes we force different forms on ourselves, which is good for experimentation and growth, but knowning when to let go of something you aren't enjoying is good too
* Some poetic forms are better written in some langauges than others
* Writing streams of dialogues instead of essays as a different approach to non-fiction writing
** Writing blog posts in the form of a ficticious dialog between the Universe and myself and intended to be humorous in nature.
* The beauty of independent websites is everyone does everything differently and looking at how people think about things can spark your own posts or thinkings
* Writing about embodied activities or the mundane details: the small things sometimes are everything
* Can writing be embodied? Or is it purely intelectual? The mind-body dichotmoy or a false seperation?

==== Learning + Letting Go ====

* Why don't they teach classes on blogging in school? So many lessons need learning!
* Still, related to the above, everyone has ideas on how writing and blogging 'should be', which aren't always helpful. 'It isn't a blog post unless' creates less writing rather than more
* From the 'Psychology Of Writing': every writer develops schemas for how the different building blocks of writing 'should' be. Your 'schema volcabulary' expands as you learn more of your craft and read more
* Reading as borrowing and experimenting: what can you learn from this? What can you try you haven't before?
* The best question to ask when writing isn't, 'why can't I', but rather, 'what if I'
* The way they taught writing essays at school, with a 'introduction, body, and conclusion,' is a helpful but sometimes stifling structure. Reading different works can help break that cycle
* Forms as constraints which conversely make creativity easier
* The smallest things in your writing are often deeply influenced by your education and upbringing
* Reading forms you'll never write is still a good idea, because you can often encorporate something from it into your writing: even if you hardly ever write poetry, you can experiment with 'poetic stylings' in your prose
* Taking your media engagement in smaller chunks can make your engagement deeper 

==== Dream Journalling ====

* Journaling about the dreams you have on your site? Or a private app on your website?
* Even the quickest of jottings before you forget them helps you remember most of what happened
* A potentially amazing insight into how your mind processes things and what keeps resurfacing 
* Some themes keep popping up in your dreams because often you don't make enough space to process them, which can be a prompt for insightful/useful journaling or notetaking
* Sometimes it feels like there's so much writing that's been published, every subject has been covered except dreams. The last unique source of ideas left?

==== Collaborative + Conversational Writing ====

* Writing to friends as a motivational method
* Letter writing as an unappreciated and underused form: fiction and non-fiction of all kinds 
* Joining a writing group or participating in community challenges
* Writing on a private website with family

==== Stylings ====

* Profanity in writing: to use or to not use? 
* Second-person writing as a way of distancing oneself from the subject or gaining further intimacy
* Punctatuation doesn't have to be default: experiment with it. Poetry does this well
* Controllng how the reader 'reads' the written text can make the experience different/more immersive

==== Writing Reviews ====

* Joining a book or movie club as a way of thinking about media, trying a new form (critisim/media analysis) and gaining new ideas or inspiration for your own work
* The langauge you often use when writing a review challenges your usual style: reviews aren't summaries
* There are so many reviews and summaries online: write yours for yourself
* The constant pressure/push-pull between not wanting to seem mean and critically engaging with a work
* Being mindful about how your thoughts might be recieved in a public setting
* Writing about your reading and reading about writing for the ultimate meta experience!
* How has reading impacted your existence? How does it influnece your writing? Your story of reading the story.
* Perhaps the author will always say it best because they know their work, but you can write what you know.
* An interesting format for writing critism or reviews: an alternate ending to the book or a remix.

==== 'Publishable' vs 'Unpublishable Writing' ====

* This dilemma often turns into a perfectionisim trap: everything can be published, because it's yours!
* 'LAN' website for families and for people who live together: ephermal notes and 
* Editing or censoring things are influenced by a variety of factors: perception, content being regurgitated by LLMs, employability, politics, etc — such is the beauty of private journaling first or sitting on things!
* Abstractions and metaphors as a form of processing difficult things or protecting one's 
* Write for your favorite humans rather than the 'faceless other'
* 'Contaiminating or beautifying the web' through the works you create, even if you'll never know the impact
* Consumption vs creation comes and goes in cycles, where one is often favored over the other. Balance is key!

==== Writing In Conversation With Other Art Forms ====

* Learning new crafts means there's always a vulenerable stage: writing can help ease you through that
* Audio snippets with written commentary
* To record your writing or not to record your writing: accessibility yet privacy concerns
* Sometimes when you read a work, you can hear the author reading in their voice in your head

=== Thoughts On Reading ===

* Reading several books vs one at a time. Different works speaking to each other or focused concentration. 
* Speaking to a stranger reading a book you've enjoyed and asking their opinion: a fascinating conversation!
* Reading as connection across time: being grateful for people taking the time to write their thoughts
* Reading shows your feelings and experiences aren't soley unique. It helps to know you're not alone
* Cite your sources so readers can follow the breadcrumbs to more delightful writing
