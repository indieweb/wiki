* Welcome to HWC!

=== What Have People Been Doing On Their Websites? ===

* {{zachary.kai}} has at last converted his formerly WordPress site https://roadlessread.com/ to Static HTML! Half the links don't work and it's still a work-in-progress but it's live!
** Another thing he's compiling is a giant list of links: https://roadlessread.com/links
** Also got the sitemap.xml and html sitemap (compiled with PHP) working! https://roadlessread.com/sitemap

*  {{capjamesg}} worked on a fun new theme for his site
* Everyone (unrelated) is catching up on books 

* {{alabut}} is working on a photos page on his website at https://alabut.com/photos/
** Designed for desktop, mobile, and RSS

* Eri wrote https://conflor.es/blog/2025-11-19-joining-the-indie-web/
** It is like magic when webmentions work, yes! 
** & a testimonial for the "intuitiveness" of microformats!
** Microformats aren't intrusive

* {{mandaris}} uses micro.blog on his site and added search
** And working with CSS view transitions
** Using https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-search-space

* The minimum view transition is adding this to css on pages you would like to have transitions
** ```@view-transition { navigation: auto; }```

Search Space: search for micro.blog? https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-search-space

* What would a website opposite button look like?
** I don't know about opposite, but here's a bookmarklet to turn a webpage upside-down https://lab.artlung.com/upside-down/
** You could also run this in Dev Tools: document.body.style.filter = 'invert(1)'

=== What's Happening In The IndieWeb? ===

* Still time left for the IndieWeb Book Club this month! {{artlung}} is hosting: https://artlung.com/understandingcomics-ibc/
** Thanks, {{zachary.kai}} for submitting to that with your newly refreshed site!

* Next month is {{alabut}} with the Non-Designer’s Design Book by Robin Williams: [[IndieWeb_Book_Club]]

* Also still time for the IndieWeb Carnival! https://alexsirac.com/indieweb-carnival-%e2%88%92-cycles-and-fluctuations/

* Books we're reading -- lots of books for the IndieWeb Carnival!

* We're having a HWC photo meetup in a few weeks! [Sunday December 7th, event page coming soon!]

* Should we host a HWC movie club pop up?

*  Apropos of Gremlins the film, Key & Peele's Gremlins 2 Sketch Might Be Their Masterpiece https://screenrant.com/key-peele-show-gremlins-2-sketch-masterpiece/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwnozRv9Vbs - Same sketch with movie clips
* Reminder: we have a movie blogging carnival going: [[IndieWeb_Movie_Club]]
** Boyhood is the movie this month! https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/boyhood-2014
** https://winther.sysctl.dk/indieweb-movie-club-november-2025-boyhood-2014/
** Could be fun to do recurring zoom events for our various blogging themes for movies, books, etc.

* Pierre created a desktop app to quickly create and upload static sites: https://onclebob.com/

* https://jamesg.blog/sitemap.xml James' sitemap.xml
* Zachary uses his sitemap to compile random page redirector / other things on website
* Having a sitemap is useful if you want to do programmatic things with pages on your website
* James found his about page this week. I found my 404 page that (ironically) went missing, but it was still there just doesn't show - https://vanderwal.net/404.html
* It's often unclear if you need one
** "If you have a small site (by small, we mean about 500 pages or fewer on your site) and you can reach any page on your site by following one or more links from your homepage, you probably don't need a sitemap" ~ Google Search Console
*** Interesting!

* https://jamesg.blog/search-pages?q=what is al
** You can use "what is [something]" on James' website to try and get a direct answer. It might give an irrelevant result if one can't be found. 

* https://veen.com/jeff/ - Jeff Veen is an investor, designer and early influential blogger that's back to writing.
