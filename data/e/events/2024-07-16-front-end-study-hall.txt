* "_why the lucky stiff" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff 
** He wrote The Poignant Guide to Ruby https://poignant.guide/ which is novel in technical communication for being a lot of fun to read and also educational about programming and Ruby
* Julia Evans zines explaining complicated computer stuff, super clear: https://jvns.ca/#zines---comics

* "Wherein wrapping text remains the hardest problem in computer science." by jwz

* Jen Simmons grid: https://labs.jensimmons.com/2017/01-020.html
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type
** We discovered by experimenting with an element by adding span 1000 to the value of grid-column Google Chrome seemed to create an implicit 1000 columns, would be interesting to know if it actually is doing that under the hood despite grid-template columns having a finite set of columns
* Heaps and Stacks opening page: https://heaps-stacks.com/
** Uses https://airbnb.io/lottie/ - a technnology sponsored by airBnB which turns Adobe After Effects tools to create json data that can be used to create animations for other platforms. 
* And we had a participant who came in with more general questions about IndieWeb concepts
