;Virtual {{new}}
: As an experiment, based on discussions at IWC-LA, {{GWG}} and {{chrisaldrich}} are hosting a virtual HWC via Google Hangouts this week for IndieWebbers who are either can't make a regular meeting or don't yet have critical mass to host one in their area. People who are in smaller cities with 1 or 2 people could still get together in a public space for the more immediate camaraderie and link into the event as a possible means of building some momentum in their cities.
