*A sample tumblr repost https://artlung.tumblr.com/post/789923825480548352/pointless-letters-pointless-letters

* webmention re-sends -- it would be nice if you could not receive followup notifications about the same originating URL when it is re-sent / the system could remember what was done with the webmention the first time (webmention.io does this)
