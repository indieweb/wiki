* transcription of events 
** Aaron says at last Portland IWC they hired a professional transcriptionist
** treat transcripts as same as video - if people are OK with video, then turn on transcription to make the recording more accessible
** with voice-to-text, that means anyone could theoretically create a transcript of a video, so would be better to do transcription ourselves so it can have context and cleanup
** CMU Speech - VOSK - local voice to text https://alphacephei.com/vosk/

* "undo" / "delete" is a hard thing to design UX around
* is "de-owning" / anonymizing an alternative to "undo"? allow content to remain but remove attribution
* CC0 comparison (Q: how do GDPR and CC0 work - e.g. can you request removal of CC0 content you created?)
