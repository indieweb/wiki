* Maxwell is in this class which is about "social computing"  https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/social-computing-research/2022-23
** covers everything from design of social networks, to applied behavioral economics (e.g. https://beeminder.com/), to the ways in which widespread access to computers and computational services (incl. internet & web) shape our society
** Could use help designing a term paper idea related to the indieweb!
** current idea is to reimplement Aardvark (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardvark_(search_engine)) on top of the Indieweb, using individual sites instead of the silo profiles they used back in 2010...
** could see something with reviews / recommendations between individual sites? 
** yee thank you
** find people with similar interests / people to collaborate with
** collaborative browsing
