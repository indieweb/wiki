--> how to find all the indie personal websites that don't use indieweb tools / microformats? 
* blogrolls on personal websites
** e.g. https://adactio.com/ -- "bedroll" -- uses rel="" to indicate relationships
** exclude silos by domain

* Big List of personal sites: https://personalsit.es/
* list of creative people (some have websites, some just have social): https://peopleofcraft.com/
* This site guided me on different wiki resources to get started with indieweb: https://indiewebify.me/
* curated "weird" websites: https://whimsical.club/
* http://biglist.terraaeon.com/
* https://indieblog.page/faq
* https://blogsurf.io/data

* https://alastairhumphreys.com/ -- personal? business? both

* https://stateb.us interesting JS tool to sync state across clients and server
* http://corlaez-chess.herokuapp.com/chess
* Google's "nofollow" link rel signals https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/09/evolving-nofollow-new-ways-to-identify
* https://indieweb.rocks/the-street
* https://www.ethicalads.io/
* https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/df_display_ads
* https://www.densediscovery.com/archive/ - sponsored posts in newsletters -- one sponsored placement and text-only "classifieds"
