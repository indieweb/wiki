As there were some new participants, Sebastian and {{bjoern}} did an intro to the IndieWeb and the idea of the [[hwc]]. We then made an introduction round and showed our websites and/or struggles with Social Media.

* {{bjoern}} - [[digital garden]] based on [[Obsidian]] (with IndieAuth/h-card support)
* Sebastian - static website with [[Nikola]] (no IndieWeb features yet)
* Max - static website on [[Kirby]], works with Tilman on [[Knot System]]
* Tilman - website runs on [[Knot System]], IndieWeb features built-in
* Alex - static website with no [[CMS]]/[[static site generator]]
* Saskia - [[Wordpress]] blog, no IndieWeb features yet
* Klaus - no current website, managed some before
* Simona - is overwhelmed with Social Media, seeks discussion more from a design standpoint


We then discussed the schedule for HWC Nuremberg. We settle for a monthly in-person meeting, so the next meetings will be [[events/2023-12-13-hwc-nuremberg|2023-12-13]] and [[events/2024-01-10-hwc-nuremberg|2024-01-10]].
