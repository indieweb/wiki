<div class="p-description description">
{{adactio}} presents ''Taking Back The Web'':
<blockquote>In these times of centralised services like Facebook, Twitter, and Medium, having your own website is downright disruptive. If you care about the longevity of your online presence, independent publishing is the way to go. But how can you get all the benefits of those third-party services while still owning your own data? By using the building blocks of the Indie Web, that’s how!</blockquote>
