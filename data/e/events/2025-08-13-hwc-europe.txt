== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!
* Using tab groups to organise your tabs
* How to save tabs to a list of links on your hard drive?
** Use case: to save research references as you browse the web
** Obsidian Web Clipper might be useful: https://obsidian.md/clipper
** an addon https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/onetab/?utm_source=firefox-browser&utm_medium=firefox-browser&utm_content=discopane-entry-link
** OneTab on Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en
** Right click + copy a bookmark folder (tested in Firefox), then paste into Obsidian. This will give a list of properly formatted links, including subfolders, with the folder/subfolder names listed above the appropriate sections.
* Making your lights change when you receive a Webmention
** You could have holiday animations too!
* https://librewolf.net/
* Make sure security updates are synced if you are using a browser fork

** https://artlung.com/ continues apace!
** My Likes are worth a click! https://artlung.com/likes/
** Joe's tilde site has become a de facto changelog

* The Firefox isn't a fox, it's a red panda!
** TIL!

* Hosting websites at home
** [[home_server]] has several considerations / guidance for running a website at home
* Personal notes discussion
** Tracking dates/times/locations written in?
** James' posts are dated automatically, but he doesn't capture where something was written in explicitly.
** James sometimes mentions location in his personal writing though
** {{rossabaker}} obsessively notes local time zones... the blogs from work trips are one hour off the rest!
** Challenge: Write a blog post in a new place for 30 days

* The BBC is good at keeping links alive over time!!!
* WordPress uses post numbers as UUIDs, comes from autoincrementing keys in MySQL (which WP uses?)
* Danger of autoincremented: they are enumerable so you can discover new posts without them being explicitly linked
** Silliness: https://everyuuid.com/
* Computerphile Distributed Systems' YouTube videos are a great introduction to distributed systems
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3DBzr--Ok, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8JqcZtvnsM
* microservices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8NDgwOllaI

* Reilly's /now page (https://reillyspitzfaden.com/now/) uses this bash script to generate markdown files for statuslog; note the ipinfo.io line for location:

<pre>sh
#!/bin/sh
date=$(date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")
location=$(curl -s ipinfo.io | jq -r '.city + ", " + .region')
slug="${date}-status"
fullpath=pages/now/$slug.md
cat >> $fullpath << EOF
---
date: $date
location: $location
tags:
  - status
permalink: false
---
EOF</pre>

* James has been publishing blog posts without categories by accident because Ghost doesn't show the category editor field by default in the Ghost editor. You have to click to see the field.
* "Why do I have to click twice to get that?" -- a quote from a UX discussion that Michael had.

* effervescence

* Unusual words for unnusual feelings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sehnsucht (German, no word for it in English), the "oceanic feeling" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling
** More words that don't translate directly into English: https://eunoia.world/
** Kupietz lists a few favorite foreign words that don't quite have English equivalents on his Vocabulary page: https://michaelkupietz.com/vocabulary/ (Farkakte, Agita)

* "I saw a snail today. Effervescent." (https://cockmcstuffins.tumblr.com/post/173037113454/bella-was-lucky-she-didnt-have-a-cell-phone-of)

* Tumblr has RSS: add /rss to the end of URLs
* Tumblr RSS feed pattern: add /rss to the the tumblr subdomain. For tumblr.jamesg.blog that is https://tumblr.jamesg.blog/rss

* Blog post idea: words from your community
** For the USians: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/dialect-quiz-map.html
* interesting words
** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Zwiebelfisch
*** relative of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake
** "Otorhinolaryngology"
* Game: "regionally appropriate Scrabble"; use dialect from where you are from
* The feeling of hearing a word that so well encapsulates a feeling you know
* perseverate - repeat or prolong an action, thought, or utterance after the stimulus that prompted it has ceased.
* monozukuri: thing-making        
* irusu: pretending to be out when someone knocks at your door
* https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/scottish-word-of-the-week-wheesht-1579180
** "First used in the 14th century, ‘wheesht’ has the handy bonus of being very adaptable. It can be used as a verb, a noun, and an interjection as in asking someone to ‘haud their wheesht’."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_effervescence

* Notable this week: for good internet swag? metal indieweb swag that donates to the org, by Nick Simson:
** https://www.nicksimson.com/posts/2025-indieweb-is-metal.html

* Kupietz's sun: (also from yesterday for links, dev comments) [[events/2025-08-12-front-end-study-hall#Michael.27s_Sun]]
* Also posted notes on pushing back on a trollish commenter
* Close to publishing his 1000th movie review
* Added a "latest movie reviews" section to his website sidebar

* WordPress' main primitives are pages and posts, and also attachments
** You can create custom post types, too. https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/custom-post-types/

* Idea: Bookwyrm for albums
* Writing about music that you enjoy
** A way to start a conversation / find people who also like the same music / have experiences related to a song you have mentioned.


* /elsewhere, a place to list your other web presences (i.e. other websites, accounts) (e.g. https://artlung.com/elsewhere/ )
** Idea: create a timeline of old accounts / when you used them / when the silo stopped running 
*** You could use this to create a timeline of Git projects
*** From Joe's updates listed on his Tilde Club page: https://tilde.club/~artlung/
*** [[IndieWebCamps]] has a timeline too

Timeline example
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_Cure_band_members#Timeline
* https://www.historicaltechtree.com/
* [[timeline]] has a text-based representation
* [[IndieWebCamps]]
** https://github.com/capjamesg/html-timelines

* Rebuilding old silo UIs for your own website to show how your profile looked
* A silo closing down doesn't stop you from being on the web

* https://playground.jamesg.blog/blackout-poetry.html blackout poetry

* {{jo}} redesigned dead.garden.
* The colour scheme is now monochrome, implemented using the saturate() CSS function.
* Using the <mark> element to make something stand out with colour.
** The art pages have colour too because it is important in the context of the art.
* Using a handwritten font for sidenotes.
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/saturate
* https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95

* {{gRegor}} is now using [[libravatar]] https://www.libravatar.org/ to get profile pictures for people commenting who leave an email address: https://gregorlove.com/2025/08/i-updated-my-site/
** How Ross does it: https://rossabaker.com/configs/libravatar/
** {{gRegor}} recommends writing about music too! Latest example: https://gregorlove.com/2025/07/music-monday-olafur-arnalds/

* https://rossabaker.com/configs/libravatar/ shows date of publication and last edit

* "last significant modification date"
* Question: how to get file edited date for use in a static site generator (i.e. 11ty)?
** 11ty has a last-modified variable that is "hit-or-miss", based on the Git commit date values.
** https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/
** RCS, an archaic version control system, used to have keywords that would expand.  Some people have tried to recreate it in Git (untested): https://github.com/turon/git-rcs-keywords
** Question: does anyone have a good way to show changes on the page over time / the original post vs. the current state?
*** Having a diff file that shows the difference between changes
*** Wikipedia (and the IndieWeb wiki) has a diff interface too
* https://jamesg.blog/assets/video/2024/12/etherpadscroll.mov
** Add /timeslider to the URL of an etherpad, or click the clock icon

humans.txt
* [[well-known#something.txt]]
* https://reillyspitzfaden.com/humans.txt
* https://rossabaker.com/humans.txt

* If you put HTML in <nowiki><code></nowiki> tags, the web browser will still render the code
* Michael now has a [code] shortcode to make sure code snippets are properly escaped
** This runs before many of the WP hooks to make sure the text renders properly

RSS feeds
* https://www.feedvalidator.org/ works well to validate the feed
* [[Monocle]]'s preview tool is also helpful: https://monocle.p3k.io/preview
* https://turner.enemyterritory.org/user/carrvo/index
** Feedvalidator has a couple recommendations: https://www.feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturner.enemyterritory.org%2Fuser%2Fcarrvo%2Fwebpages.rss.xml

* About half of the people on the call have manually written RSS
* RSS to HTML tools exist, like https://rss.bloople.net/
* [[granary]] https://granary.io lets you convert between formats, like RSS, Atom, and mf2
** {{gRegor}} uses and recommends this to convert an HTML+microformats2 page into Atom, for example: https://gregorlove.com/stream/feed.atom is set up to redirect to Granary for the feed of https://gregorlove.com/stream/

* Webmention: https://github.com/carrvo/SVNmentions

To [[jQuery]] or not to jQuery
* https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
* "jQuery" begins with "J" (and so does "JavaScript"!)

* https://jamesg.blog/kittyscript
* "I'm sure this is really helpful for cats who know English"
* "I'm pretty sure cats understand strings" :D

* https://esolangs.org/wiki/Rockstar
* https://esolangs.org/wiki/Yet_Another_Musical_Esolang

* Kupietz's cli-based website interface has an easter egg where you can localize the command language to 'pirate': https://michaelkupietz.com/cli.html?language=pirate (type 'shanties' at the prompt to see the commands.)

* geiger counter midi music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_JxWM8iQSA
* "finally music on cd" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuAH8QUTufg
* Yasunao Tone - Solo For Wounded CD (1997): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYBki7ixg68

* Google indexing tips
** Include a rel=canonical to tell Google what the canonical URL is, so Google doesn't have to try and figure out the canonical URL itself
*** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#canonical
** Add a sitemap.xml file so Google can easily find URLs on your site
** I have code to generate that file *from* a flat file of urls: https://gist.github.com/artlung/210438 
** If you have more than 10000 links, https://gist.github.com/artlung/613e6ac577a170bf2b4b9045486f129e
** Then you can point at the one, or multiple sitemap xml files from robots.txt

Options to not get "AI Overview" in search
* https://udm14.com/ -- disable AI overviews in Google and various other rich snippets
* https://tenbluelinks.org/ -- instructions to update search on desktop and mobile to disable AI overview by default
* https://startpage.com privacy friendly search + options to not use AI
* You can set these up on your phone too!
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/list.txt -- looks like a custom syntax for identifying elements / DOM nodes.
** https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters/
** https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234
** Syntax reference: https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/wiki/static-filter-syntax
* You can use uBlock Origin to block content on a page by selector in cluding has-text() to include text content in the selector
** James does this to block various elements on websites that he finds distracting
* https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ublock-origin-lite/id6745342698

Filter Copilot from GitHub:
* https://codeberg.org/rossabaker/github-copilot-filters

* Caching: remember to ask people to clear their caches if you have made a change that may be cached
* James' thought for static sites: caching has been more trouble than the performance gain it gives

* Pressing the authorship button will clear authorship for everyone

* Light switches and thermostats
* {{rossabaker}} apologizes for the barking dachshund.  (Can we add this to the template?)
** We didn't hear it! :D

* jQuery revisiting: https://lab.artlung.com/rosetta/?jquery https://lab.artlung.com/rosetta/?vanilla ~ I just added a 2025 edition of the same handlers I had created back in 2010 to enumerate how to do event handlers that do some different dom manipulation and ajax calls which are far simpler to do these days.
** We also talked about the importance and significance of jQuery back during Front End Study Hall 27 [[events/2025-05-08-front-end-study-hall]]

* Ethics / policies on websites
** https://reillyspitzfaden.com/ai-policy/

** James' writing on technology design principles: https://jamesg.blog/2025/03/05/technology-design-principles, and https://jamesg.blog/2025/02/10/designing-technology
** {{artlung}} does not have a unified statement of ethics but web pages bring to the fore a number of issues including ethics of software, data collection, journalism, photography, proper quoting of sources and republishing ethical considerations.

* https://github.com/benjifs/micropub
** https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-micropub

* James is thinking about a Ghost Micropub tool that takes a Micropub request and POSTs it to Ghost with a HTML tag.

* https://orangegnome.com/posts/3633/team-fat-posts
** {{rossabaker}} is horrified as a back-end developer but finds it interesting as an IndieWebber...

* Example of James' search: https://jamesg.blog/search-pages?q=artlung.com&page=1

* https://ragt.ag/books gets a list of books with microformats properties
** Goal is for book pages and the /books page to aggregate all information about each book
* h-book is a great name for a book :)
* Idea: You could show links to others' websites who have also reviewed a book you have read
