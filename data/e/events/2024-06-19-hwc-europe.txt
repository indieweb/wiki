{{gRegor}}: PHP programming question
- this syntax of wrapping a `new` object in parentheses, what's the reasoning for it?
- https://github.com/odan/slim4-skeleton/blob/master/config/bootstrap.php#L8
- I've seen it with `require` lines too like https://github.com/odan/slim4-skeleton/blob/master/public/index.php#L3
-- I might have figured it out myself: the required file returns a Container and the wrapped `()` lets you immediately call methods like `run` in this case.

* "Making websites lately feels like working at the Kirkland Signature version of an Apple Store, all cheap and anodyne, with the actual foundation of everything we build buried under a dozen layers of abstraction brought to you by five companies that sell ads. "
