== Notes ==
Welcome Scott Jack!

* microformats and properties for music posts
** Jacob asks whether examples in the wild of jam posts for albums, not just individual songs
** [[scrobble]] or "listen" - activity, what you are doing right now
** [[jam]] - resource, your music/albums/etc.
* Jacob mentioned MusicBrainz for tagging his music -- looks like they have an API with JSON and XML endpoints https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API/Examples
* ...and ListenBrainz is their new project for scrobbles! It seems to be in early beta but I'm getting pretty excited about it and would love to hear others' thoughts -jacob

How useful is it to post granular information about your life? We discussed the virtues of posting your day-to-day drinking, health, travel data
* Ben Atkin brings up a great point - "It's impressive that Aaron conducts himself in such a way that he is confident sharing all that info about his life"
* Dave mentions Aaron had some [privacy-related?] issues with posting his flight itineraries before flying - some kind of unwanted attention; had to change them to show up on his site after each flight takes place
* it's so easy accidentally leak more data than you intended, such as by failing to strip EXIF from photos

Jacob's demo: added a homepage feed to his site w/ post type display, and sent his first webmention!
