Looking at Node.js packages for handling Microformats. Currently reaching out to package maintainers with some improvement ideas. [https://github.com/getindiekit/mf2tojf2/issues/20#issuecomment-1558769025 Currently focused around Indiekit].
[https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello-indiekit Current Indiekit config for ciccarello.me] is mostly working on a staging site but some issues when running without MongoDB

Quick note for screen reader users: For the best experience, use the latest version of [https://mozilla.org/firefox FireFox] and [https://nvaccess.org NVDA] to access the Etherpad document. Use Alt-F9 to access the toolbar, and continue tabbing until you enter the main editing window, then use the NVDA+Spacebar shortcut to enter focus mode. To exit focus mode, use the Alt-F9 again to return to the toolbar and use the NVDA+Spacebar to exit focus mode.

[[accessibility]]
* Do we need a page for [[screenreader]]? List NVDA and others
