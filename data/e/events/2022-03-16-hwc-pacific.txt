=== Level 0 IndieMark ===

IndieMark Level 0 has the general theme of owning your own domain. Having your own domain name which is pointed at a site is a space that is under your control and you can start establishing your identity. It does not mean you have to self-host...you can pay an entity to host your site.

* register a domain name
* have a personal web site at that domain
