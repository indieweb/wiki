After debugging Tilman's  issues with a flexible grid layout and a sidebar that wouldn't want to fill the whole available space, we checked out Design Arena and LMArena to see how different versions of LLMs handled coding problems.

Afterwards Tilman presented the work of one of his students which created a quite impressive HTML site to show his current work and former projects.

{{bjoern}} showed how he improved the link preview generated for his website by adding Open Graph tags to it. He documented the whole prozess on [https://bjoern.stierand.org/notes/digitalgarden/linkpreview/ his site] as well.

We did some further investigation to improve Wolfgangs web site, especially the way he uses modal popups and the clickable links to the events.

In the end we also talked about [https://html.energy/html-day/2025/index.html HTML day] and set this on the agenda for next year to take part in this event.
