== Notes ==
* CSS History: Acid1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid1 "Acid Tests" -- "Box Acid Test" was the original name, in 1998.  
** A nice reminder of "interoperability" - on the IndieWeb wiki that word redirects to "specifications" [[specifications]]
* OSI Model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model - {{artlung}} is usually content to operate at the presentation and application layer but knowing about the network layer - as in traceroute - can be instructive
* https://builtwith.com - See what technologies a business uses.
* https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/
* Ros shared that she used the Crazy 8s technique to plan a website https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/crazy-8s " is a fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. The goal is to push beyond your first idea, frequently the least innovative, and to generate a wide variety of solutions to your challenge."
* Scroll based animation site (mentioned in Front End Study Hall https://www.akaivyc.com/ )
* https://coolors.co/image-picker - a tool for uploading pictures and making colour palettes
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark
** e.g. <nowiki><blockquote>Hello <mark>world</mark></blockquote></nowiki> ''which looks like'': <blockquote>Hello <mark>world</mark></blockquote> 
** by default Safari, Firefox and Chrome set a background color of yellow on the marked word.
