== Notes ==

Just a small group today because of illnesses.

We discussed about the general idea of the IndieWeb as there were 2 interested people from the FabLab crew who wanted to know what this is all about. We showed [[site-deaths]], the [https://killedbygoogle.com/ Google Graveyard] and different sites from indieweb.org.

We then showed each other what we made in the recent month.

Max added a link to his website to receive tips via PayPal. Just after 4 days of implementing it he received his first tip today.
He also added a feed to his [https://www.maxhaesslein.de/visual/photography/moments/ daily photos] and uses [[IFTTT]] to import them in [[Day One]]. To share photos, he created a (not yet published) photo gallery app with several features (creation of thumbnails & caching, automatic generation of ZIP files for download, secret links etc.).

{{bjoern}} added an overview on his [https://bjoern.stierand.org/now/ Now page] of the music tracks he listened to most in the last 30 days. A script gets the data from [[last.fm]] and generates a web page that is included in his static web presence by an iframe.
Another iframe shows the latest track played on Spotify. When a track has finished playing, a private [n8n https://n8n.io] instance triggers a webhook running on a private server. This call includes artist and title data from Spotify. The Python code behind the webhook creates a JSON file which then is parsed by a HTML page.

Sebastian added a [https://make.sfeld.eu/posts/devices-in-docker-verwenden/ new blog post] to his site.
