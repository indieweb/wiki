== Topics ==
* Protecting static pages (aka how to do a 401 for a plain ol' HTML page)
* page type good for [[now]]?
** https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/40
** how to do evergreen pages? (which might mean "the page content never changes" or "the page is permanent but the content gets updates")
* how to address Single Point of Aaron? reusable libraries? from https://mxjn.me/2021/03/24/1 :
<q>How can we encourage tool/solution reuse between individual IndieWeb sites, without building more hosted services? It seems to me that many IndieWeb participants, especially those starting out, end up either (a) relying on Single Point of Aaron services or (b) building their own solutions for every aspect of the IndieWeb "stack" (Webmention, Micropub, a posting interface, etc.) This problem could be addressed with a stronger culture of developing reusable libraries for IW tasks, but turning your own code into a library usable by others isn't always easy.</q>
* pros, cons, use cases, and UX considerations of doing real-time chat on your web site (such as communicating with visitors) or via your web site (such as with a hypothetical "chat-message" post type that syndicates to IRC or Discord?
* https://david.shanske.com/2020/03/18/3309/ - One year later..."During tonight’s online Indieweb NYC Meetup, I asked the question: If in 100 years, all historians had to learn about you was what was on your website…would that be enough?"

=== Evergreen Pages ===
* {{angelo}}: A page that's continously living, always changing
* {{kartik}}: Mistook it as the opposite, in the sense that the content is evergreen and so does not change
* {{GWG}}: Mentioned https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/40

=== Protecting Static Pages ===
* do protection, authorization w/in the server config in front of the statically rendered pages
* encrypt the pages, then use JS to decrypt with a password entered by user
** extends to multiple passwords - Chef Vault uses one encrypted file to allow multiple users to authenticate
* To reduce the payload size, you can fetch the encrypted content with an AJAX request after the password is verified

=== Page Type Good for now ===
* {{GWG}}: I'd prefer my [[now]] page to be automatically generated
* {{jacky.wtf}}: Where is a good place? (contact, about, home)
* {{GWG}}: Potentially using a calendar to show your availability information
* {{angelo}}: Internet Radio! using the page to share potentially a IceCast info
* streaming music over di.fm and sharing link
* {{jacky.wtf}} wants to take it one step further and display the progress bar of music he's listening to, plus waveform - https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform and https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform
* relationship-status on [[now]] h-card

* tantek.com/github/PROJECT -> github.com/tantek/PROJECT
** discussed in chat on Monday: https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-03-22#t1616441858942400
** e.g. https://tantek.com/github/cassis 

** automatically "own-your-link" by mapping eg. user.com/github/{SUFFIX} to github.com/user/{SUFFIX}
** selectively "own-your-link" by mapping eg. user.com/projects/{PROJECT} to github.com/user/{PROJECT}
** further brainstorming: keep a list of domains to redirect, and optional pattern (e.g. with silo profile path) to redirect

* Templates discussion?
** see https://indieweb.org/template for background
