=== Flexbox vs CSS Grid ===
[https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/WNWPyXW Codepen] for this topic, demonstrating CSS techniques with markup from {{marksuth}}'s website.
* {{aciccarello}} explanation of CSS grids and flexbox
** Grids are for 2-dimensional layouts
*** https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
** Flex does 1-dimensional, either vertically or horizontally
*** https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
** Can combine flexboxes by nesting within them (alabut would love to see examples!)
** {{marksuth}} and {{alabut}} are transitioning their sites from Bootstrap to pure CSS, Mark with Grid+Flex, Al w/ just Grid
* <code><base href></code> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base
* Coming soon: Nested CSS
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting
** Some browsers don't support nested selectors that don't start with a symbol, so consider using the "&" syntax
** Handy tool for browser support: https://caniuse.com/?search=nested%20css
* Recently updated version of Revenge.CSS - https://heydonworks.com/article/testing-html-with-modern-css/
** (technique for QA and highlighting errors or bad practices)
* <code>padding-inline</code>: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-inline
* clamp(): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp
* units: <code>rem</code> vs <code>em</code> vs <code>ch</code> vs...
** {{gRegor}} I don't do a lot of different units, but I tend to prefer rem (especially for text) to avoid the inheritance issues of em.
** https://zellwk.com/blog/rem-vs-em/ I haven't reviewed this in a while, originally from 2016, but may still have good info
** {{alabut}} still using px for personal work and wondered why it's fallen out of favor? Especially since his site works fine for zooms, even on mobile.
** {{kevinmarks}} made a compelling point about mixing CSS frameworks and components which might be using rem units, then conflicts and issues can arise.
** {{artlung}} worthwhile to experiment with [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units CSS Units] - I find keeping a consistency in the unit I use makes it easier to reason about a design
** Opinionated and over-simplified post I referenced in the call: ''[https://adrianroselli.com/2024/03/the-ultimate-ideal-bestest-base-font-size-that-everyone-is-keeping-a-secret-especially-chet.html The Ultimate Ideal Bestest Base Font Size That Everyone Is Keeping a Secret, Especially Chet]''
** I was wrong about adactio - his https://resilientwebdesign.com/ uses <code> font-size: calc( 1em + (2 - 1) * ( (100vw - 20em) / ( 100 - 20) ));</code>
** Not forcing default font sizes to prevent overriding the web visitors browser/system? settings.

=== Basic HTML Tags ===
MDN is a good resource in general: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements

The HTML Accessibility API mappings (where "semantics" actually matter, because this is what gets exposed programmatically to assitive technologies): https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/

=== Microformats Showcase ===
Pizza website made on [[Glitch]]
* Clicking on regular text, it's a sneaky link that shows the ingredients and instructions
* Showing the source code, there are [[h-recipe]] with `p-ingredient` and `e-instruction` classes
* Demos parsing it via pin13.net
* {{kevinmarks}} showed [[unmung]] parsing and displaying the recipe as a card
