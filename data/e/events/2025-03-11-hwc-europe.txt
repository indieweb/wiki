** Listening to blogs as podcasts
*** I listen to many blog posts by havung TTS read them to me ({{jo}})

* "Drink my coffee in the morning, read my rss"; following people writing on the web.
* Problem: Feeling like you're drowning in content; lots of tabs, endless scroll, not the attention budget to manage open tabs of content to read.
* We have time to *listen* but not to *read*?
** Molly White does 
*** Example post https://www.citationneeded.news/crypto-reserves-no-public-good-no-principles/
* Reader Mode: you can have posts read to you
** https://web.archive.org/web/20031207144002fw_/http://www.spacebrothers.com/robotradio/
** Readability plugin for Firefox https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/readability-based-reader-view/
** We've had the tech for thishttps://granary.io/for 20+ years https://web.archive.org/web/20031207144002fw_/http://www.spacebrothers.com/robotradio/
** James has done audio posts in the past that are < 10-15 mins: https://jamesg.blog/2024/10/09/performance
** They were unique to make!
* Recording podcasts takes time
** Recording
** Trimming files
** Editing
** Getting file formats right
** Uploading files
** Audio engineering / getting the podcast to sound good
* This Week in the IndieWeb podcast: [[this-week-in-the-indieweb]]
* Browsers have "reader mode" that can do text to speech
* https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/pocket/
* Speech synthesis built into browsers:
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis

"Granary for audio"
** Use case: preference for listening vs. reading.
** Take text, run text-to-speech technology to generate a podcast
** Text -> audio / podcast with RSS
** Shouldn't use AI
** There may be existing accessibilty tools out there that are relevant
** This could be part of a /reader interface that lets someone run TTS on a blog post

* Brian - found a comment in FreshRSS https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues/4760#issuecomment-1437434768 
** a person using the feature of FreshRSS to *create* feeds fed into an app called Readably then read by an Android app called Voice Aloud Reader https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperionics.avar&hl=en_US
** Definitely for me {{artlung}} I would expect to curate a list of things to listen to from an existing RSS reader

* What we're doing on our websites this week
** Adding movie reviews to website - https://www.trovster.com/movies
*** Working with a dataset of Academy Awards movies
*** Using machine tags to navigate through films
*** Making a list of winning movies one hasn't watched
** Simplifying things on site back-end
*** Removing code that is no longer needed
** Working on video management with Git LFS
*** Accounting for files, are files backed up
*** Making sure the presence of files is intuitive
** Adding code snippet line numbers

* Similar movies / books on our personal websites
** James wants to create pages like "Books like {book}" with my recommendations
** Example from Zachary: https://www.roadlessread.com/books-like-nimona/
** It's cool to see people interested in personal recommendations
** Similar recommendations means you won't find the things that are different to something
** "All great art takes a familiar idea and juxtaposes it with a new idea."
** James' movie recommendations: https://jamesg.blog/movies
** There are lots of parameters in recommending a movie
** A friend recommending a movie may encourage you to prioritise it

* https://coryd.dev

* Find similar bands: https://www.music-map.com/
** Similar songs: https://www.chosic.com/playlist-generator/
** https://www.gnoosic.com/
** https://www.music-map.com/taylor+swift
** Idea: a physical dial that lets you change the music map to vary the degree of similarity or difference

* "More static websites, please"

* Software development practice: take a day to analyze how you could remove code that is no longer used / could be abstracted, etc.
* Workplaces with periodic code removal - afternoons, or addressing technical debt

** Idea: 88x31 flipbook

* Owning your links 
** Top level paths like /github/<repo> redirects to your github.com/<account>/<repo>
*** https://tantek.com/2022/144/t1/redirected-github-ownyourlinks 
** If you move to another Git tool, your links will still work!
** /wiki
** What other paths are people using?
** /tip, /pay
*** https://slashpages.net/#tip
** Related: /links
** https://bkardell.com/links
** /links could redirect to a LinkTree until you make a /links page, if you like the design of LinkTree
** Appeal of LinkTree: simple design

* When is it viable / appropriate to have a permanent link to something vs. a temporary link?

* Joe sharing a story of Artists signing paintings with IG handles
** What if they lose the handle / delete their account?
** Related: https://www.mollywhite.net/verify/

* Domain names as handles (i.e. instagram.com/@example.com)
** Interesting idea, but there are many security considerations

* https://www.instagram.com/benji.dog/
** Not benji.dog

* What makes a good slug?
** Memorable

* Idea: FrESH session for making your own /linktree or /links page
** Putting this on the fresh todo list

* /links page ideas
** https://artlung.com/links
** Glitch had a template for making your own LinkTree page called [https://glitch.com/glitch-in-bio Glitch in Bio]
