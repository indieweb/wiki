incorporating new colors into the wiki! 

whostyles

Example of people posting on one site, in their own styles: https://www.kickscondor.com/HT2020/ (click then scroll down)

Kicks recommends sanitizing CSS before applying whostyle to a comment: https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/

Perhaps styling within a comment element could be "reset" using a CSS revert: https://caniuse.com/css-revert-value
This will revert the specified CSS style to the browser's default setting. For example:
    .whostyle {
        all: revert;
        ...
    }
I will add this idea to my blog post!
