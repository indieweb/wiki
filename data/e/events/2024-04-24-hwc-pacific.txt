* Combining Open Heart Protocol with webmentions
** {{aciccarello}} would like to trigger anonymous reaction posts in webmention.io
** Would need a temporary post for webmention.io to check
** Wonder if there would be a webmention extension to allow anonymous reactions
** For a static site, an edge function is probably the simplest solution
* ActivityPub and privacy
** If someone deletes a post, does my reply via bridgy-fed get notified?
** Bridgy does handle [https://fed.brid.gy/docs#web-delete deletes]
** Unclear if a reply from bridgy-fed of a mastodon post gets notified (depends on what deletes mastodon sends)
