Tilman is trying out [[Ghost]] and showed how he has set up his cloud instance and the [[ActivityPub]] integration (see [https://ghost.org/help/social-web/?ref=activitypub.ghost.org here] (which is in beta and cloud-only, so you can't yet use it on a self-hosted instance). This setup allows you to use your own domain name for your Mastodon account (something that is also achievable by running software like [[GoToSocial]] or using the [https://bjoern.stierand.org/notes/socialmedia/webfinger/ webfinger] workaround).

{{bjoern}} vibe-coded a theme switcher for his website. The initial version had some flickering when switching themes, so Max pointed out a fix by restructuring code. There was also some discussion about the code quality of the JavaScript the AI created.

Alexsandr rewrote his 'Menzingers Shirt' website. He used and old-school ImageMap to highlight different sections of the shirt and display relevant information on the side. He also added a language selector.

Afterwards there was some dabbling with synthie stuff in the browser (see links below).
