== Notes ==
* Welcome to Homebrew Website Club!
* Pierre: train is Paris → Grenoble

* What have people been working on in their websites lately?
** {{zachary.kai}} - working on puzzle generators! and general site fixes
*** Finished the circular maze generator: https://zacharykai.net/tools/circlemaze
** {{pcarrier}} – monitoring mice speed :) https://nothing.pcarrier.com/posts/lag/
** {{artlung}} joined the IndieWeb, CSS Joy, and Zachary's Star Wars Webring
** {{capjamesg}} - Co-writing, and making web pages! (like https://playground.jamesg.blog/text.html)
** {{btrem}} working on an iCal feed. Was working on iCal feed. Probably giving up on it now. Because Drupal doesn't make iCal (or really, anything!) easy.
** {{rossabaker}} continues to reform his Home Page.  May have something better to show at the Americas session!
*** Added secondary nav
*** Pruned the overwhelming 12-pack of icons to 6
*** Has summaries of recent blog posts, adding configs and notes next
** {{kupietz}} discovered that getComputedStyle() in js includes units in the output, which tripped him up but has now been resolved, and added a "fire monster" art gallery in response to a generative art challenge on LinkedIn, at https://michaelkupietz.com/too-hot-to-handle-monsters-uncensored/ (although if I was going to recommend a gallery to check out, that's not necessarily it, that's just what I happened to have done recently. "Deleted Scenes Monsters" from last week is funnier https://michaelkupietz.com/deleted-scenes-monsters/ )
** {{vanderwal}} -- added a blog post editing page for his website during Create Day.
*** Added tools to add a new category and edit category names
*** Updated XML page to use same design as other pages
** {{gRegor}}: working on parsing my Twitter export from tweet.js format to [[blog_archive_format]]. Starting with one HTML file per year, with h-feed and h-entry markup. Will also have JSONfeed since that's part of the BAR format. No demo yet, but plan to open source the code (PHP)
**

* How we think
** Using hand gestures to figure out the flow of an animation
** Making faces while we think hard about something

* Webrings
** [[webrings]]
** https://cs.sjoy.lol/
** https://zacharykai.net/ is a member of many
** List of webrings https://brisray.com/web/webring-list.htm
** {{benji}} made this: https://1.44mb.club

* Links!
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle
** https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback

* Obscure HTML element of the week: <q>
** Does the right thing with smart quotes in various languages
** Does not copy-and-paste cleanly

* Styling XML documents: [[XSLT]]
* https://subscribeopenly.net/subscribe/?url=https://jamesg.blog
** You can add readers to the list at https://github.com/capjamesg/subscribe-openly
* https://shareopenly.org/ wiki: [[ShareOpenly]]

* Accessibility bookmarklet https://sa11y.netlify.app/

* https://www.pi.fyi/welcome
** James enjoyed reading https://www.pi.fyi/p/lorde
** https://www.theverge.com/creators/24054294/perfectly-imperfect-pi-fyi-app-tyler-bainbridge

* Apps as a means by which to publish to the web

* Zachary has encouraged two people to start websites!
* There are new people starting websites!
* https://htmlforpeople.com/ is a good resource for beginners!

Where can we find those German* "start a website" buttons?
* did I misunderstand it?
* I was talking about Jo from Germany instead of Joe from California :D thank you
* https://dead.garden/blog/some-88x31-indieweb-buttons.html
	
Accounts of knowing people for whom Facebook being the lens through which people see the internet
* Social networks promoting posts that make people angry

* Joe made a swooping pelican! https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/GgpRRVK
** Idea: turn this into a bookmarklet which injects a pelican and remove an element from the page
** based on an interaction with a pelican I had yesterday. 
** I now have a video on my page of that interaction: https://artlung.com/videos/reels/pelican
* https://www.benji.dog/%F0%9F%8D%AA
* "Cross-site pelican attack"
* A scrollbar where a sloth follows you as you scroll
* "animals of the indieweb"
* "guardian of the lizard"
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonbill

* Things we want to make
** A page curating wildlife we have seen near us
** /local-flora /local-fauna -- documenting what's close
** Fixing pagination
** Using co-occurrence to find similar categories / categories used together
** Creating sparklines with categories 

* How to find blogs related to the topic you like
** Following Subreddits and looking for blogs that are linked on posts you enjoy
** Neocities
** Blog directories, categorised by topic
** [[directory]]
** https://ooh.directory
** https://blogroll.org
** https://gossipsweb.net/
** https://naiveweekly.com/
** #inktober for sketching / drawing
** Searching Mastodon tags
** https://tumblr.com for finding artists

* Websites and navigation; every website as its own city, and the feeling of being lost and exploring to find your way around.

* Thomas' fishing annex (an idea for the .net category)
* [[pagination]]
* The content on a /page/1, etc. is not permanent (it will push posts onto other pages, which means it can't be bookmarked).
* How could date-based pagination work on a static website?

* A networked pelican that can fly between websites
** webring-adjacent
** https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Pete

* Idea: A web page where you collect epherma/trinkets you have found.
** Related: Geocaching.

* A /pelicans page where you share things that pelicans can take from your website

* https://git.schmarty.net/schmarty/gem-diamond
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwiftOnSecurity

* James worked with https://www.andycarolan.com/ on his mascot design. Highly recommend!

* /ai slashpages: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vThO3so7dDshcfzNUlDZ0SDs1c-pxpU0llcLHEgNoAiLdcBWOP5RQrnrF6GcXRUtYhYs1fSg7uSc6dF/pubhtml?gid=204057601&single=true
** Some pro, some con, some mixed.  Nice way to set expectations!
** {{kupietz}} has added one at https://michaelkupietz.com/ai-policy/ and will have it mirrored at https://michaelkupietz.com/ai but at the moment does not, as I'm having a database conflict of some sort. 

* Quotes pages
** https://michaelkupietz.com/quotes
** https://jamesg.blog/quotes
** Poem out of quotes: https://dead.garden/blog/lines-out-of-context.html
*** i also wrote this poem with quotes from war and peace https://dead.garden/poetry/#moon
** https://zacharykai.net/ideas#quotes
** https://www.vanderwal.net/random/category.php?cat=185

Fun fact: You can put #anchor links in a .htaccess file

* You could have a /lyrics page that curates lyrics you like

* Vocabulary pages: https://jamesg.blog/fun-with-words
** Zachary has a section of "words learned" on https://zacharykai.net/ideas#words

* https://artlung.com/videos/reels/pelican

HTML files are easy to save! (in contrast to using a video tool where it may be easier to lose your work?)

* [[mascot]]
** Could the IndieWeb mascot be a pelican?

** You can subscribe to the IndieWeb newsletter via RSS, email
** Suggestion from Zachary: maybe [[Buttondown]] could arrange to "sponsor" the This Week newsletter?

* IndieWeb phone ring

* LinkTree as a good first step to introduce people on Instagram to having a website
* Some people consider Instagram a "web-enough" presence

Wanted to add a plug for {{mattl}} https://1800www.com/ that he recently announced - let's bring back the fun and weird internet.

* Drawing on whiteboards
** Having whiteboards in different rooms to write on
** Writing things on paper as we go through our days

* https://ragt.ag/clock
** Source: https://ragt.ag/clock/source
** To get all timezones in JS: const timezones = Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')
*** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/supportedValuesOf
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTimezoneOffset
** [[indiebookclub]] uses this and some math to convert the timezone offset to seconds and can use that if you choose to set a specific published date for your posts (instead of the default "now"). It's filled in in the text field that's under "Advanced"t

* You can use "Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone" to get the user's timezone
** James uses this in his web reader (but got a report from a user that their timezone wasn't correct)
*** you might try the getTimezoneOffset() above ^^

* Angelo demoing editing pages on his website
** An "Auto-preview" feature lets you see previews live as you edit, which can be disabled if preferred

* https://ragt.ag/reader

* https://jamesg.blog/2024/08/18/time-based-lru-cache-python

* https://michaelkupietz.com/ai-policy

* The HTML piano: press a key for a tag
** "HTML as music"

* Related to pelicans, I've drawn a pelican on a bicycle and added to my blog post. https://artlung.com/blog/2025/07/08/pelican/

* https://jamesg.blog/ now has an "RSS" link to Subscribe Openly and https://vanderwal.net/ has a Subscribe Openly link too.

* A pelican 88x31 button

* "I heard a little bit of compression"

* Many of the people on the call have their own 88x31 button
** [[88x31#IndieWeb_Examples]] (add yourself if you're not already!)
** https://www.benji.dog/linkroll
* Animation tool https://www.fliiipbook.com/ (not 88x31)
* "there's a lot of good buttons out there"
* "i need to make one" // "that's what i'm doing right now"
* https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Silkscreen by Kottke -- ideal for pixel text.
** MacOS can do expansions of text, tantek for example can do <p and get <p>
** https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/ Emmet is a tool one can add to editors which does similar expansions

James Q: what is the most logical text expansion for each html element — shortest keyboard shortcut?
* This would be a fun script to write!

"code and conundrums"

"pelican postal service"
* Associations between pelicans and mail (i.e. in Animal Crossing
* Pelican beaks are bigger than pigeons so they can carry more

"pelican crossing"
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_crossing

"toucan crossing"
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan_crossing

"puffin crossing"

* "The PUFFIN (Pedestrian User-Friendly INtelligent) crossing"

Blog series idea: HTML editing tips
* Autoclosing HTML tags
* Custom text expansions - available on MacOS in System Prereferences > Keyboard > Text > click + to add expansions e.g. <code><a</code> to <code><a href=""></code>
* Closing HTML tags that change when you change the opening one

* Mark tried a strawberries and cream sandwich
* https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2024-07-02/a_taste_of_wimbledon.html
