== Notes ==
* {{artlung}} Joe's background today is a bit of web history - a creative use of html frames from  https://fray.com/hope/meeting/ - I asked on Bluesky and Mastodon and https://bsky.app/profile/artlung.com/post/3lgw4gtcnsk2g
** Archives from HotWired ? Also could be on Webmonkey, if that is archived
An overview of frames and other more modern layouts - https://dev.to/andreasbergstrom/a-history-of-web-layout-techniques-from-frames-to-webassembly-1akj

Jeff Veen had a historical write-up of Wired and HotWired layout and design with the mention of frames in 1997 - https://veen.com/jeff/archives/000903.html

Article about dark mode 
https://css-tricks.com/come-to-the-light-dark-side/

* Vince uses Dark Mode all the time with the Dark Reader extension: https://darkreader.org/
* The <picture> element: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture
* srcset? multiple <source> elements with media attributes to mimic @media queries

* Are CSS resets still relevant?
** An old favorite: https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
** A new favorite: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/
*** Less about /removing/ defaults, more about /evolving/ defaults

* Reasonable HTML "is a single HTML document that contains a reasonably complete set of example HTML elements.": https://www.reasonable.work/html/

Issue with header
* https://mandarismoore.com/2025/01/29/your-browser-does-not-support.html

Updated HTML:
<code><nowiki>
<h1>
    <a href="https://mandarismoore.com/" title="Mandaris Home Page" style="display: inline-flex;outline: 1px solid red; /*! max-width: min-content; */padding-inline-end: 3em;">
        <img src="/svg/UserIcons_Mandaris_02.svg" class="logo" alt="">Mandaris</a>
</h1>
</nowiki></code>

Changed CSS:
<code><nowiki>
/* Element | https://mandarismoore.com/ */

header.site-header h1 a {
  display: inline-flex;
  outline: 1px solid red;
  padding-inline-end: 3em;
}
</nowiki></code>

* {{gRegor}}: I enjoyed this recap video by Kevin Powell, "My best CSS tips from 2024" (not necessarily *new* CSS features): https://youtu.be/lUU2OAAg4Uw?si=kBqDl6bYYnFqW55v

" The Joy of Incremental Design Improvements" - {{cjamesg}}
** {{rossabaker}} made a mess, and is finding joy in decremental design.  What can be removed, to build again?

Joe mentioned, I think, Matt Webb's Interconnected blog, with soft color shifing - https://interconnected.org/home/

Design - design brief
Lots of variation - hard to do design
