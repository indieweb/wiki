== Notes ==
* Where people come from
** Stumbling in from Mastodon
*** You can follow the #indieweb hash tag, not just individuals
* Socials
** Bluesky: mathy, but conversations not as deep as Mastodon?
** https://app.wafrn.net/: ActivityPub and ATProto together?
* Hosting options
** Personal domain, and you can switch between these options later: [[personal-domain]]
** Ghosty
** Self-hosting - [[self_hosting]]
*** Security implications
** [[GitHub_Pages]]
*** "easy" with [[Hugo]]
*** doable with [[Eleventy]]
*** Jekyll integration - [[Jekyll]]
** [[Netlify]]
** CloudFlare Pages
