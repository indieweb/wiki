To do:
* discuss video policy to add to photo policy page
* include video archiving notification in event listings
* talk to Aaron or Sven about getting events posted automatically on Twitter beforehand
* decide on friendly terminology for former project categories (ideas for not-mean terms: inactive, idle, on hold)
* define what it means to be (on hold / idle / inactive / term) - what specific length of time? 

* https://indieweb.org/former_projects
** Abandoned seems meaner
** there were a bunch of other suggestions for terms:
* idle
* inactive
