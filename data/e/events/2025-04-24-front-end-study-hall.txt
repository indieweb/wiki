== Examining Ben Evan's Artwork ==
* {{artlung}}'s background today is the landscape from the work of artist Ben Evans: '''''Pure CSS Landscape - An Evening in Southwold''''' with the <code>sun1</code> set to <code>#ff0000</code> (red).

* Ben Evans links:
** [https://www.tinydesign.co.uk/ tinydesign.co.uk])
** [https://www.youtube.com/c/ivorjetski YouTube: ivorjetski]
** [https://codepen.io/ivorjetski CodePen: ivorjetski]

* [https://apps.artlung.com/landscape/ apps.artlung.com/landscape] adapts Ben's Code to allow for a query string of 6 hex digits to allow differing sun colors
** Initial plan was to adapt the [https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color/ SCSS functions] to modify color--<code>darken(), desaturate(), darken(), adjust-hue(), rgba()</code> and adapt them to <code>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix color-mix()]</code> and <code>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch oklch()]</code> both of which are available in the browser. With css custom variables <code>$sun1</code> could be adapted to be defined as <code>--sun1</code>.
** In lieu of that a partial change was made to use that for a subset of the colors then use a server-side compiler in PHP: Composer package ([https://scssphp.github.io/scssphp/ ScssPhp])
** The result is not particularly fast but does allow a modified result based on an edited query string with a 6 digit hex color

=== Exhibition at Leicester's Phoenix Gallery ===

* {{marksuth}} attended ''Paint by Stylesheet'' - shared some photos of the exhibits which featured CSS code front and center written on the wall

* Possibly the first in the world CSS-forward art exhibition. 
* Description:
** ''New Media Art Club’s exhibition Paint by Style Sheet features works created during their fourth artist bootcamp – an intensive, two-day residency that brought together artists to explore the creative potential of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as a medium for drawing.''

== A Terrific Talk about AI in an Accessibility Context ==

* Shared by {{artlung}} talk about using "discriminative AI" for providing good alt descriptions of an image, but generative AI is pretty much garbage
* ''AI and Accessibility: the Good, the Bad, and the Bollocks'' / Léonie Watson / FFConf 2024 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij-GLix2QUQ
** Leonie is great and has been part of w3c for many years - '''her website is [https://tink.uk/ tink.uk]'''

== Discussion: Sound in a web page must be the result of a use event ==

* Sounds generated by a page must be initiated by a user - '''why?'''
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Best_practices
* if you want midi - have a look at https://feross.org/bitmidi/ which has a WebASM midi player 
* <embed> vs <audio> tag
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/embed
* <embed> vs <object> vs <audio> vs <video>

== Watching new browser capabilities roll out into browsers ==

* BCD Watch: https://bcd-watch.igalia.com
* anchor positioning, color mixing 
* "baseline project" - puts the 
* Tiers of "not very available", "newly available" - fewer than 30 months, "widely available"
* How long does it take to deploy things out to the world

== On The Humble <nowiki><hr></nowiki> ==
* Inspired by a skeet from [https://bleeptrack.de bleeptrack.de]
** ''I just set an <nowiki><hr></nowiki> tag. I think, I haven't done this in 20 years. Did they get out of fashion or is it just me?'' ([https://bsky.app/profile/bleeptrack.de/post/3lnkbfahfoh26 src]}
* It's not a top 20 used tag
* But it is very useful!
* https://www.advancedwebranking.com/seo/html-study
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/hr
* Eric M and Michael has terrific styled ones, and Mark Sutherland styles his as candy canes at Christmastime

== More widely available <code>shape()</code> ==

* shape() https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/ZYYGLmy
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/shape not quite in Firefox, but coming
* if you can look at a clip-path polygon you can read a shape code syntax
* similar to SVG code but more readable to a human

== Other Fun Stuff ==

* https://geocities.live/ turn your site into a Geocities-looking site
* [https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/ LQIP placeholder images]

== Vectors, Vectors Everywhere == 
* SVG is coming, server-side generated flash
* SMIL - interactive media
* inline graphs
* {{kevinmarks}}  Nunjucks or Jinja to generates chunks of SVG
* [https://observablehq.com ObservableHQ]'s [https://observablehq.com/plot/ Plot] library - Mike Bostock's [https://d3js.org D3.js]
** Plot is much more declarative and nicer to write
** Making graphs

* Sophia is playing with D3 - see [https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/ fractalkitty] on CodePen
** showed off several art, word, data visualizations using D3 and other tools
** gravity, inertia
** Vornoi diagrams are built in.
** D3+ P5
** https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/pen/QwWbGjd
** https://bettercatastrophe.com/ (example presentation with nice SVG paths) (example Sophia found)
* Mark Sutherland showed off an older client work that used SVG + animated isometric backgrounds to show birds in an environment along with data/words
** https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/?
** https://airbnb.io/lottie
* Michael K showed off https://www.kupietz.com/filemaker-ddr-analyzer/ - interactive database dependency charts with WASM port of GraphViz
** Useful for visualizing database dependencies: tables and stored procedures in a Filemaker which can be complicated to understand and untangling when administering a database
** Visual tools can help us understand  complex structures 
** Graphviz art from Michael of social graphs - https://michaelkupietz.com/?p=29448
* Mark S showed a photo of The Tate's flash deprecation notice ([https://www.tate.org.uk tate.org.uk]) 
* https://ruffle.rs/
* "we are living in a scroll economy"
* Fractalkitty was asked about a written piece of hers that lacked photos where typically there would be photos - she was making a deliberate choice to share in a particular way
* "All websites should have a pigeon"
* I will replace my pigeon with a flying toaster" (e.g.: https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/live/BawKOeP )

== Thanks for supporting FrESH for a year ==
* '''A word from {{artlung}}:'''
** This marks the 26th [[Front End Study Hall]] - today was the one year anniversary
** Everyone ought to make a web page 
** We are all carrying around web browsers which are our window into the world and we need much larger views of the wide world
** I remember being able to walk up to a small home computer at Sears or Radio Shack and typing 
*** <code>10 PRINT "HELLO"</code>
*** <code>20 GOTO 10</code> 
** and having a feeling that a computer was something that was subject to my control. And human beings all ought to have a bit of that feeling, that computers are tools that we can learn to use, not be magical machines we are ''subject to'' or mere tools to doomscroll with.

== Here's to more FrESH ==
