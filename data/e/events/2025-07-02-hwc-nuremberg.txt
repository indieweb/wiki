We welcomed some new people to this special edition of the HWC Nuremberg. The regulars introduced themselves, told everybody what the HWC is all about and showed their websites.

Afterwards it was time for all first-time participants to show what websites they currently have. URLs are shown above for all participants.

We also had a lively discussion about web frameworks, blogging engines and going back to the basics (no libraries, just HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript).

Afterwards the discussion split in different groups and we had a nice evening in an air-conditioned room. :)
