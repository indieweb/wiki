** https://eva.town
* Domain registrars
** Netim is a European domain registar that Zachary uses
** A few people use Namecheap
** James uses DNSimple but wants to move because you have to pay for DNS

* We need a dancing banana GIF for the IndieWeb
* "homebrew candy club"
** pass around recipes to make your own candy
* If your website had a scent/flavour, what would it be?
** Vanilla, a palate cleanser (thank you for correcting my spelling; I can never spell that word)
** mustard flavoured ice cream (pcarrier.com)
** James: Petrichor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrichor)
* AI being unreliable!
* Mike demoing his Big Diffr, browser-based diff tool
* James fixed a bug that broke most of the <code>a</code> tags on his website
** It was caused by three lines of code that were not properly indented by accident
** James' site builds are now three seconds long because he now uses incremental builds
** I also made https://jamesg.blog/green, and am thinking a lot about sustainability (through environmental, software, and personal / time lenses)

* {{pcarrier}} you may appreciate https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-system-design/. I read it this week and found it interesting. {{pjg1}} you may like this blog post too! ✅✅
* https://danq.me/2025/08/15/details-summary-lightboxes-in-pure-html-css/
* How to do galleries in HTML
* Designing templates that fit our content well
* Semantic markup is easier to read / understand, both as a code writer and someone reading your website
* {{artlung}} stripping down the markup of his old WP based photogalleries https://artlung.com/photos/

* {{rossabaker}} created a script to export his Pixelfed account as JSON
** https://codeberg.org/rossabaker/pixelfed-cli
** With Hugo content adapters (https://gohugo.io/content-management/content-adapters/), can integrate photos into site without any intermediate Markdown files
** That API is similar to Mastodon's.  Might be able to double dip.

* pcarrier is almost ready to announce his keyboard layout. Big fan of the form factor and ease of flashing OSS firmwares.

* How we writeframe / make prototypes of designs
* Paper - James (and designing in the browser too!)
* Balsamiq - https://balsamiq.com/
* TLDraw - Benji, https://www.tldraw.com/
* Q: Do people wireframe, or do people go straight into coding?
** pcarrier wireframes in Concepts on iPad mini
** https://kinopio.club/ mind mapper tool very visual

* Shareable URLs are amazing

* Open call for feedback: If you have feedback for how we can improve this meetup, please let James or Mark know!

* "websitey" -- Benji

== Events-o-rama ==

* What we do at in person HWC events?
** Chatting about websites!
** HWC Edinburgh is held in a coffee shop bi-weekly. We have a writing hour every ~second Tuesday of the month, and a regular HWC to chat about our website on the last Tuesday of every month.

* [[Homebrew_Website_Club]] has organising information
* See also [[build_a_website_in_an_hour/organizing]] for a build a website in an hour event

* What would our dream web events be
** A lunch and learn meetup about the web / skill sharing
*** Something a bit informal would be nice, especially to attract people not already in the IndieWeb scene
** James would love to do more local meetups
** Thomas appreciates events with lots of demos of what people are working on
** HWC is doing well in terms of structure

* When you organise in person events, you have to be on the ball. It's totally possible to organise in person events though!

* San Diego tech meetup: https://marchmingle.com/
* Other meetup formats: speed networking, coffee morning, coworking, collaborating on personal projects, University meetups
* Web San Diego did happy hours, coffee meetups, going to watch a movie, and other event types
** Took lots of work but had lots of creativity
* https://minnestar.org/minnebar/
* "hacker time" -- an hour to work on websites that Benji helped organise
* UX Speakeasy in San Diego does events that are akin to speed dating "speed networking" to meet potential collaborators
* Variety is a nice way to do an event
*https://www.emfcamp.org/
* https://creativemornings.com/fieldtrips
* More pop ups that are more speciifc on technical details / maybe using breakout rooms too
* [[Create_Day]] - could potentially do breakout rooms during create day

* Idea: having protocol around contact information or preferences for link sharing so people can follow up on ideas from HWCs

* IWC Leicester is something that there is interest in organising. James and Mark will share more information in the coming months as we think more about planning.

* What pop ups would people be interested in?

* The diversity of topics expands our understanding of making websites / our world views
** Accessibility demos help us learn more about accessibility on our websites

* Notes are a valuable part of our sessions; the document can live on the web via the wiki forever for others to discover / read / use.

* If you are doing something cool, write about it!

* James would love to do an in-person event in his local area

* Having detailed information about codes of conduct, venue, transit, parking, accessibility considerations, are all essential for in-person events.
** Having all practical information you anticipate things will need is essential.

* Fish and chip shops

* {{pjg1}} thinking of starting an HTML/CSS playground inspired by http://playground.jamesg.blog and http://lab.artlung.com
  ** Have a few lab-like posts on my current site that I'd like to move - https://pjg1.site (❤️ great site!)

* {{artlung}} my reels (nascent) goal is to capture and experiment with the workflows for video and specifically short video
** https://artlung.com/videos/reels/
** https://artlung.com/videos/reels/ti994a-iwc/ (includes link to TI-99 emulator and source code)

* The idea of a playground may extend further than HTML / reference materials
** You could have a playground for experiental writing, poetry, and anything creative you want to play with

* https://muan.co/
** https://muan.co/notes has a checkbox "tag filter" that lets you filter pages by category

* Less distracting having a dark mode website all day than a light mode website all day
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme
** :root { color-scheme: light dark; }
** one line gets you a light dark scheme instantly, but *then* every usage of color in a stylesheet needs to be considered

Gotta run to another meeting. Great seeing yall - benji <3 (👋 ❤️)


* Pierre's desk setup: https://nothing.pcarrier.com/posts/desk/

* Great blog post about design: "Visual design rules you can safely follow every time" https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/
** Re: dark mode. The first suggestion on the list is "Use near-black and near-white instead of pure black and white"

* Dark mode can be hard for people who have astigmatism 
** https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/dark-mode-accessibility-myth-debunked/
** Reader mode availability is the escape hatch for designs which don't allow for user choice

* https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages

* Catering to users who use heavy night shift
** James thinks about this because he uses night shift a lot, especially in the evenings https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8546r

* Dark mode inspiration:
    ** https://www.darkmodedesign.com/

Proposal: CSS Media Query for Browser Reader Views (from 2023)

* Ambient light/dark mode on Android devices based on a light sensor
** Dark mode after sunset / light mode in day
** Ambient changes may be unexpected for many users 

* https://ident.me/json could have sunset and sunrise times.

* James' mascot / seasonal emoji could change based on day / night

* Tension: user wants preferences but developers need to account for and test support for all of those preferences.
** Discussed in Good Internet magazine: "Can accessibility be whimsical?" https://goodinternetmagazine.com/can-accessibility-be-whimsical/ 

* Calculating sunset has many nuances -- elevation, lat, long, and other geographical considerations

* https://david.shanske.com/ - does locative weather and other stats to posts - includes WordPress plugins to provide that kind of data
