== Notes ==

Mostly silent work for the first hour. We talked a bit about the current state of AI (AI models in Kagi, [[Google]] Gemini 3/Nano Banana Pro).

Max tried to work on a problem with his gallery. He wants to add a description/alt text to all images and left-align it below the picture. This doesn't work as expected when the screen size is too small and is caused by the various display option he offers (e.g. showing 2 vertical images side-by-side).

{{bjoern}} improved the layout of the tags displayed in the random posts on his website. They now appear much more subtle and don't grab the attention that much.

Wolfgang tried to add an improvement to the database behind his website and had some issues with the corresponding MySQL and the PHP queries. Together we (hopefully) managed to fix it and he can now progress to migrate his old web site to a new instance with an updated technlogical stack behind it.
