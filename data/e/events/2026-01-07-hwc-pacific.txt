== Notes ==
* Welcome to Homebrew Website Club Pacific Edition!
** [[Category:CMS]] [[Category:SSG]]
** [[Getting_Started]]
** How do you answer the question "what should I look at to make a website with a newsletter?"
** There's a self-hosted FOSS newsletter service called https://listmonk.app/
** [[newsletter]] (may need a little gardening)
** https://blogtrottr.com/ will create an email newsletter for any RSS (individual subscription)

* https://www.sensorwatch.net/ <- replacement internals for Casio F-91W; can be reprogrammed with custom firmware

* Anthony bought a new domain! "rello.me" as a shorter way to say his longer domain name - many usages!
* http://rello.me currently redirects to full https://www.ciccarello.me but would like to make some short urls

* Holiday decoration takedown for Nick Simson
** archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20251229161135/https://www.nicksimson.com/
* There's a wiki page for [[holiday_theme]]

* {{rossabaker}}, inspired by {{artlung}}, started making Top4 lists
** https://rossabaker.com/tags/top4/ (cheeky and awesome!)
** Github - https://github.com/peterspath/topfour.net add yourself if you have a fun list of top 4 things (top 3 and an honorable mention is the language used)
** https://blogofthe.day/ had updates! Also works with a source JSON file, as "top 4" does

* Reilly uses manually-written JSON for their /blogroll page
** Data: https://github.com/reillypascal/personalsite-ssg/blob/70701a0af5980082df23f2c89651af6fb7be6d7f/pages/_data/blogroll.json
** Presentation:  https://github.com/reillypascal/personalsite-ssg/blob/70701a0af5980082df23f2c89651af6fb7be6d7f/pages/blogroll.liquid

* Nick uses manually updated JSON for a few sections of his site (/vinyl, /library, /playlist)
** https://github.com/nsmsn/dotcom/tree/main/src/data

* Hugo supports JSON output: https://gohugo.io/configuration/output-formats/
** Naty uses a `index.json` template in Hugo to automatically create a list of posts on the site, which is read by her secondary blog on WordPress as "Recent blog posts" instead of using RSS
** The JSON has title, permalink, description, date, image link (if available)

* The YAML 1.1 spec is 86 pages long.
** https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell
** Using YAML in 11ty https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-custom/#yaml

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML
* https://toml.io/en/v1.1.0
** the default for some Rust projects
** also increasingly Python (pyproject.toml)
** first-class support in Hugo
** no significant whitespace <-- this is the big win
** date time support
** no anchors... which don't work in GitHub Actions anyway.
** recurring theme: fewer surprises

* https://01minnow.com/ - my (Joe) brother-in-law created a retro themed website for his 90s indie band

* Naty created a new statistics page for her Hugo blog, using Apache ECharts (https://echarts.apache.org/) and Hugo built-in calculations (https://gohugo.io/functions/strings/countwords/)
** She's still working on releasing a repo for the code and docs site: https://burgeonlab.com/stats
** Visulizations guide for creating a GitHub-style heatmap calendar: https://burgeonlab.com/blog/github-style-heatmap-calendar-widget-visualizing-hugo/

* Indiekit is a Node.js server that adds IndieWeb features like Micropub, IndieAuth endpoints (https://getindiekit.com/plugins/endpoints/), and also works as a Micropub client creating post-types like `note`, `photo`, `article`. 
** [[Indiekit]]
** IndieKit reminded Joe of https://posseparty.com/ but it's not really a 1:1 comparison at all 

* [[sparkline]] folks have sparklines! 

* Reilly shared this https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2026/01/sending-webmentions-with-a-simple-shell-script/ and fixed an example chunk of code on the indieweb wiki
** [[webmention-implementation-guide#One-liner_webmentions]]

** Re: longevity of archive.is, I went down the blog archives rabbit hole and their second post in 2012 was "What will happen to the data when you shut the site down (eventually)?" on a Tumblr blog: https://blog.archive.today/post/38139265209/what-will-happen-to-the-data-when-you-shut-the

* For music events:
** https://setlist.fm and https://www.concertarchives.org/ for concert data

* Re archives on event links, {{gRegor}} is pretty proactive about capturing an archive when I create event posts, e.g. https://gregorlove.com/2025/10/mates-of-state-somewhere-tour/

* Example of a photo of setlist from {{t}}: https://flickr.com/photos/tantek/2130847226

*Question: What's the advice for making a website for photography (so lots of photos)?
Morgan question RE photos website: Like a gallery? Gallery style website?
I'm still not sure what exactly I want but I'm thinking of the gallery style website too! 

* Morgan shares about an interesting guy he met recently: https://www.isaacmarion.com/ . Has his own domain... squarespace? but has a lot of video presence online on instagram and stuff. A real old school influencer?? Doesnt need much website to be successful :)?

Clint mentioned https://pigsquad.com/ - it might be interesting to see if they'd be open to doing a shared meetup/event.  Since I'm already on their discord, I can reach out to one of the moderators and ask...
