== Notes ==
{{kartik}}
* Problem: How to best advertise the availability of functionality like [[fragmentions]] or [[highlights]] and [[annotations]]
** Example UI of [[Hypothes.is]]
** Exmample of [[badge]]s for [[Microformats]] or [[Webmention]] that some sites use
** Add additional pop up UI in addition to the link icon already in use on Kartik's website
*** Maybe add a question mark icon that links to a page describing functionality or also have a pop up in the corner/side describing functionality in detail until the idea is ubiquitous

* Demo of manual display of Webmention on [[TiddlyWiki]]
** Possibly first known displayed Webmention on Tiddlywiki at http://tw.boffosocko.com/#Bookmarklet%20for%20pasting%20content%20into%20TiddlyWiki
* Demo of [[backlink]]s or [[bi-directional link]]s on TiddlyWiki using TiddlyBlink

Katherine Frazer:
* Problem: How to allow a limited community to share bookmarks in private or semi-private setting via a simple user interface like SMS or email
** [[Micropub]] as a potential solution using [[WordPress]] or [[WithKnown]]
** [[Quill]] does email / MMS https://quill.p3k.io/email
*** [[Omnibear]] https://omnibear.com/ is a browser extension for Chrome / Firefox that is a [[Micropub]] client
** [[Zapier]] SMS Integration -- https://zapier.com/apps/sms/integrations
*** How to pronounce Zapier - https://twitter.com/zapier/status/674080383764455424
** [[Known]] at  https://withknown.com/
** Link for Katherine for [[IFTTT]]/[[Zapier]] set up to post from a site to a community website.
*** https://boffosocko.com/2020/01/21/using-ifttt-to-syndicate-pesos-content-from-social-services-to-wordpress-using-micropub/
*** Use a particular bookmark site like Pinboard, set up a service to watch the community's accounts and then micropub to the community website (essentially PESOS to Community Garden)
** [[issue_tracker#yak_shaving|Yak shaving]]: https://talk.fission.codes/t/yak-shaving-programming-term/582 --> 
*** Example from Malcolm in the Middle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0 
** [[Tumblr]] as an answer to this problem
** [https://www.twilio.com/ Twilio] as a potential solution using SMS
*** Issue with SMS otherwise is cost/infrastructure in addition to the possible problems with limited bandwidth of 140 characters as a limit
*** Perhaps look at MMS as a solution instead?
** Secondary problem: How can we make this an easy solution not only for the people who are using it, but an easy-to-maintain solution for the developer who is maintaining it for the group?
