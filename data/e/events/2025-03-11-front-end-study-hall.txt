* Benji is implemetnign code blocks
** how does one add line numbers to code blocks
** Demo: https://codepen.io/benjifs/pen/emYGJpo
** CSS selectors can't address free chunks of text
** GitHub Gists wrap all lines in spans
*** e.g. https://gist.github.com/artlung/613e6ac577a170bf2b4b9045486f129e
** Manny mentioned https://highlightjs.org/ He uses hugo which has a parser. He had to work to get it looking good. https://mandarismoore.com/2023/09/22/labarum-code-blocks-turning-tables.html
*** Reilly uses 11ty and pulls in code to run highligthing client-side
*** I used to use PrismJS which supports line numbers: https://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/
**** https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/
* https://codemirror.net/
** https://cdnjs.com/libraries/codemirror
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-position

* Jeremy has an issue with icons in the footer of https://www.jeremycherfas.net which are not working
** Diagnosis: the usage of <code>invert(1)</code> has an interesting side effect, if the selectors apply to multiple layers of css selectors then the invert can reverted

* {{t}} Cloudflare email spam protection can inject content on the page
** replaces things that look like email addresses (like fedi @-@ address) with "email protected" in the content (and JS to fix them up)
** See [[Cloudflare#Unwanted_email_protected_in_content]]
* Tantek implemented new security, using Cloudflare on top of his webhost, after a targeted attack on his infrastrutreu
** https://tantek.com/2025/052/b1/steps-indieweb-cybersecurity
* 1 of 8 of us use Cloudflare
* On by default email protection ought to have been communicated
* SSL & HTTPS
** Dreamhost is the origin, which has a Let's Encrypt SSL
** Cloudflare serves from Dreamhost
** Cloudflare SSL cert is ''distinct'' from the SSL Cert
** One way to think about Cloudflare is as an "opt-in" man in the middle attack. 
** CDN services can have servers around the world
** Anyone else use services like this or CDNs?
** {{artlung}} uses a pair.com CDN service for static assets and large assets
** Video Pop Up [[pop-up#IndieWeb_Video]] early april?
