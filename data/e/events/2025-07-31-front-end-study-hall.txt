== Notes ==
* My background today is the https://html.energy/ - On August 2 there will be the second HTML Day in cities around the world
* '''Fish & Amp Chips'''
** HTML leaking out into the real world

== Media Accessibility ==

* Continued progress from [[events/2025-07-17-front-end-study-hall|FrESH #032]] ~ https://lab.artlung.com/comics-a11y/
** Seeking more examples of comics accessibility markup

== TIL Tags: slot, template ==
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/slot
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/template
** Meant to hold templated HTML for the purpose of being used to programmatically create new rows client-side
** Often accomplished using backtick characters to create strings which can have a consistent mechanism to include JS values without lots of string concatenation


=== Server-Side! ===
* Kupietz had a problem with PHP HEREDOC generating JS files which contained backticked-JS vars for using in strings, which PHP then treated as embedded PHP variables, didn't just output literally to JS. The answer was NOWDOC. HEREDOC v NOWDOC: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11153049/advantages-inconveniences-of-heredoc-vs-nowdoc-in-php
** ''Server side usually {{artlung}} uses [https://twig.symfony.com Twig]''

== Notable Links! ==

* SVG Crop https://svgcrop.com/ ~ via Eric M, does exactly what it says on the tin! Crops SVG files encasing logos or logotypes with unsightly whitespace around them
* Great recent article on SVG: [https://www.joshwcomeau.com/svg/friendly-introduction-to-svg/ A Friendly Introduction to SVG] by [https://www.joshwcomeau.com/svg/friendly-introduction-to-svg/ Josh Comeau]

== Updates! ==

* {{kupietz}}'s draggable theme programming https://michaelkupietz.com/ - plugin enables any parts of a WordPress page to be draggable
** learnings mobile vs desktop
** no scroll - '''pointer events''' - rainbow hover effect: (Touch events, not pointer events... probably should have done pointer events but was already most of the way down the road to touch events when I discovered that. -Kupietz)
** '''touch-action''' https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action
** github repo for plugin: https://github.com/kupietools/ktwp-wp-plugin-draggable-elements


* ''Awesome! I might use those CSS properties to enable moving the pinwheels on '' https://lab.artlung.com/slideorama-pinwheels/ ~ {{artlung}}

* Thomas submits Too Much Coffee Man comics for a11y assessment: https://www.shannonleowheeler.com
** On looking at the source, turns out it appears the individual markup Apple Live Text, originating in Safari browser and MacOS

* '''Apple Live Text''' ~
** https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/462749/how-to-customise-safari-ocr
** How does this work? Adds a component to the dom? Is there any customization available to this?
** Is iOS and MacOS implemented in the same way?
** Appears to work with JavaScript off
** There is a Help item describing Live Text in Safari and interacting with the text in it but no ability to control the text
** Relevant because it may impact a11y of comics
** The Apple "Live Text" is part of the OS and is a layer on top of the image. Developers can add it into their apps, but Safari has it built in and enabled - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit/enabling-live-text-interactions-with-images/ (this is Apple Developer documentation link, not sure if it is available without a developer membership)
** Part of VisionKit for iOS or Mac

== Misc A11y Stuff ==

* https://roysamuelson.com/book/ - book on audio description for games and films
* https://www.qwantz.com/ - translation - crowdsourced?
* Perry Bible Fellowship a11y?
* Timing is everything - audio descriptions and inherent audio in a film have to work together
* Captions in video content also something I want to study
* Also to study is to examine if possible how mainstream comics companies deliver the accessibility layers in their comics (DC Comics, Marvel, etc)
* Pour one out for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language SMIL], which want intended to deal with synchronized multimedia

== On the persistent lack of consistent markup for Quoting ==

* Thomas (again) brought up - https://lab.vanderwal.net/blockquote-plus.html The Blockquote Plus to sort out missing semantics

* Kupietz's scheme for per-domain emails and passwords: https://michaelkupietz.com/using-per-website-emails-passwords-to-protect-against-data-breaches/
