* Fish & Amp Chips - HTML leaking out into the real world - https://www.restaurantji.com/ny/brooklyn/fish-and-amp-chips-/

* https://lab.artlung.com/comics-a11y/
** Seeking more examples of comics accessibility markup

* Kupietz had a problem with PHP HEREDOC generating JS files which contained backticked-JS vars for using in strings, which PHP then treated as embedded PHP variables, didn't just output literally to JS. The answer was NOWDOC. HEREDOC v NOWDOC: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11153049/advantages-inconveniences-of-heredoc-vs-nowdoc-in-php

* SVG Crop https://svgcrop.com/
* Great recent article on SVG
** https://www.joshwcomeau.com/svg/friendly-introduction-to-svg/

* Michael's draggable theme programming https://michaelkupietz.com/ - plugin enables any parts of a WordPress page to be draggable
** learnings mobile vs desktop
** no scroll - pointer events - rainbow hover effect: (Touch events, not pointer events... probably should have done pointer events but was already most of the way down the road to touch events when I discovered that. -Kupietz)
** touch-action https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action
** github repo for plugin: https://github.com/kupietools/ktwp-wp-plugin-draggable-elements

** making the pinwheels mobile https://lab.artlung.com/slideorama-pinwheels/

* Thomas has a Too Much Coffee Man comic  https://www.shannonleowheeler.com

* Apple Live Text
** https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/462749/how-to-customise-safari-ocr
** How does this work? Adds a component to the dom? Is there any customization available to this?
** Is iOS and MacOS implemented in the same way?
** Appears to work with JavaScript off
** There is a Help item describing Live Text in Safari and interacting with the text in it but no ability to control the text
** Relevant because it may impact a11y of comics
** The Apple "Live Text" is part of the OS and is a layer on top of the image. Developers can add it into their apps, but Safari has it built in and enabled - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit/enabling-live-text-interactions-with-images/ (this is Apple Developer documentation link, not sure if it is available without a developer membership)
** Part of VisionKit for iOS or Mac
*
** https://roysamuelson.com/book/ - book on audio description for games and films
** https://www.qwantz.com/ - translation - crowdsourced?
** Perry Bible Fellowship a11y?
* Timing is everything
* Captions also somethjing I want to look at

* Thomas (again) brought up - https://lab.vanderwal.net/blockquote-plus.html The Blockquote Plus to sort out missing semantics

* Kupietz's scheme for per-domain emails and passwords: https://michaelkupietz.com/using-per-website-emails-passwords-to-protect-against-data-breaches/
