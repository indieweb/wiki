*** I do not want to make myself a wiki page! defining myself is intimidating - Ender
*** no need to make yourself a wiki page! you can merely edit the existing ones :) -t
*** certainly no need/expectation to define yourself on the wiki. Lots of folks have "just" their domain name as their identity and that's all.

* Possibly Sacramento -> add a subsection here: [[Planning#New_Cities_Looking_For_A_Co-organizer]]
* Possibly SF -> edit/update this: [[Planning#San_Francisco]]
** Noisebridge https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Getting_Here
* James is happy to ask around for event spaces in SF if needed; email if interested.

* HWC Edinburgh hybrid coming up
** maybe ping folks listed at: [[Planning#Edinburgh]]
