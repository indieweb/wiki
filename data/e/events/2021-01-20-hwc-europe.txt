for James regarding separating personal/professional site: [http://www.roughtype.com/?p=8724 From context collapse to content collapse]

(peter goes on a talks a lot about retro to introduce BBS as a precursor to homepages and gopher)

As for BBS: "BBS: The Documentary" by Jason Scott

(because he tried Gemini and decided not to provide it as a version of his site just yet)

Sidenote: there is a weird, scattered community of retro services, eg. http://mbrserver.com - a musician making - his words - "avant-garde chiptune, synthesized heavy metal & classical symphonic music", but there's a whole area of retro services on his server; BBS, gopher, IRC, etc.
