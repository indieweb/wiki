== Notes ==
* Ben: challenge is "chain of custody" -- frex Facebook follow button is one-click, IndieWeb is multi-click and more work
* Can we draw inspiration in communication from RSS? 
* Protocols are great for enabling functionality but how do you make them user friendly
* RSS has a similar usability issue "what is this xml file???"
* https://www.subtome.com/ is a way to make it more user friendly (click this button to subscribe)
* in an ideal world, the feed reader interface would give the subscriber granularity over what they subscribe to -- hard to anticipate from a website owner's perspective what subset or division readers may want to follow
* Conventions are important for consumers to know how to filter content from producers
* Twitter style posts look odd on Facebook; same with Instagram. Communities develop different conventions and interoperability can be hard
* Traditional social media practices will likely continue to change, migrating services as generations change
* [[Vouch]]
* [[2018/Berlin/responses]] talks a little about trust levels
** [[spam#Levels_of_presentation_based_on_combination_of_trust_signals]]|
* allow and blocklists -- comparison to email spam done at the IP level
