== Notes ==

=== Introductions ===
Greg: https://jgregorymcverry.com/ Showed off the educational sites he helped students and their parents build after hosting a workshop for it http:///tech-4-teens.club

David: https://david.shanske.com/ Added ability to track moon phases in his latest Wordpress update, refined additional weather-related data display. Now he's working on updating the  webmentions plugin for WordPress.

Marty: https://martymcgui.re/ He's posted an animated pic of his cat every day during quarantine so far (Eternal #Caturday), using MicroPub. 
Recent projects: Bit off a lot when he wanted to make a stripped down, opiniated version of IndieWeb building blocks into one mash-up. 
So he's gonna end up building a bunch of versions of these building blocks. Currently working on adding to the minimal set of tests for IndieAuth.

Alex Bilson: https://alexbilson.dev/ Played around with Web Mentions
* shared a link https://alexbilson.dev/comments/2020-07-14_204612/ where he shared this link on his site from his mobile phone: https://mxb.dev/blog/indieweb-link-sharing/
Used a webhook to automatically deploy his static site

Angelo: https://lahacker.net/ His website's coming down so it can come back up under a different domain once and for all!
Rebuilding Github-like components for IndieWeb? maybe a new h-project microformat?

Sarah: https://sarah-hibner.com/ Set up a stream to post updates across her ecosystem of websites: http://log.sarah-hibner.com/ Had to engage with HostGator to deal with some web hosting issues! Currently working through issues w/ hosting a site on a subdomain vs her main domain when hosting on WordPress.

Jacky: https://jacky.wtf/ Working on publishing tools! Koype/Publish is getting support for [[content warnings]], [[tags]], and more. Wants to use it to publish to his own site by the end of the week. Working on custom post properties like [[location]], [[citations]], and more.

Tracy: http://cascadiainspired.com/ Been blogging for a long time. WordPress site with customized theme. Adding in IndieWeb plugins and testing things out!
Uses webmentions but only seems to be receiving them from herself right now

Aaron: https://aaronparecki.com/
Thinking a lot of about [[IndieAuth]] and Micropub lately, he's looking forward to upcoming [https://events.indieweb.org/2020/07/micropub-pop-up-session-kGMIMOXFUdBn Micropub event]. Site is chugging along quite well at the moment!

Emma: https://emmas.site/ 
Uses [[Jekyll]] for her site; 
Interested in distributed web tools. Learning about [https://gemini.circumlunar.space/ Gemini Protocol]

Chris: https://boffosocko.com/ 
* Loves tinkering with [[highlights]] and [[annotations]]
* Earlier this week found a Chrome browser extension (only browser so far) for annotating snippets of the web: https://boffosocko.com/2020/07/13/learning-paths-annotations-and-highlights-to-ones-website-using-threadreaderapp/
* It has a Twitter integration that lets you post all the highlights you've made and tweet them out as a twitter thread
* Since Threadreader App added micropub setup, you can unroll the Twitter thread with that too
* Workflow: Highlight a bunch of things, clicked a button to send to Twitter, unrolled from Twitter to post to his website


== Topics ==
=== Twitter Hack ===
The implications of that [[Twitter]] hack that happened today
* aaronpk "I am a bot on Twitter" -- great t-shirt idea! ;)
* Brings up the problems of a monoculture when a single bug can bring down an entire network reliant on the same software system

=== Webmentions+ philosophy ===
* Marty's Webmention Post https://martymcgui.re/2020/07/15/what-we-talk-about-when-were-talking-about-webmentions/
* Web mentions are notifications from one website to another.
* On top of that, we've built additional layers of ideas and infrastructure
* Microformats so you can add comments, likes, replies, favorites, reads, listens, and other post types now
* What does it mean for your site to have webmentions on your site? Just base level? Or does it include microformats too?
* Top complaint: People collect web mentions but do nothing with them
* That's why Aaron made it! To hoard web mentions so he could have them in one place and deal with them later!
* Emma asked if you can use CNAME to send webmentions to webmention.io

=== What to display on a homepage ===
Helping out Tracy with Webmentions/reach/POSSE/PESOS; 
Tracy's had a blog for a long time, trying to open her mindset and adjust to the idea of putting everything she posts on there instead of treating it as a traditional blog; 
Do people divide up their streams of information on their sites, she's curious to know how everyone handles it.

Tantek: It's okay to change what you post over time

Emma: Has been blogging on and off for a long time and a lot of it was just link blogging. Now she's trying to do more short-form writing addressing technical stuff, blog what you want, people's blogs change over time

Angelo: Aggregating different domain names 

Jacky: Delineates his sites between professional and personal contexts

Greg: Delineates everywhere, has subdomains, wikis, etc.

Tracy asked how people handle with Twitter contexts

Aaron: Made conscious decision not to show his replies on his homepage, only stuff he posted (same as Twitter)

=== Ideas around Microsub clients / social readers ===
