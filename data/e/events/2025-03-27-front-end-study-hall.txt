== Agenda ==
* The agenda is set by the participants!  What HTML & CSS are on your mind today? 
** James is thinking about view transitions (how do they work; and what does browser support look like?)

=== Joe's Background ===
* Mission Impossible Website, 1996 https://web.archive.org/web/19961022174928/http://missionimpossible.com/
** Was thinking about sites from that time and trying to remember the first time I ever encountered video as a result of a website, and mostly the experiences were negative, difficult, constrained by bandwidth and technology, and 30 years later we can watch video when walking around on phones!

=== Space Jam! ===
* Eric's background is the original Space Jam website
** Jen Simmons Space Jam (CSS Grid): https://labs.jensimmons.com/2017/02-015.html
** Original Space Jam (tables galore!): https://www.spacejam.com/1996/

=== Centering a poem, simply ===
* Center a block, keep text left aligned, don't artificially constrain width:

*** Ross asked "how'd I do" - {{artlung}} replies: it's great! Terrific use of <code>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content fit-content]</code>
** Eric M has a take on a similar topic: https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/04/26/flexibly-centering-an-element-with-side-aligned-content/
*** <code>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-inline-size max-inline-size]: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-content max-content];</code>

=== W3C Breakouts Day 2025 ===
* Was yesterday https://www.w3.org/2025/03/breakouts-day-2025/
** Learnings ''30 months'' is the baseline time before developers take up a tool on the web
** After 30 months features are 95% in the wild

* Inspiration for a rebuild of my personal site, refinding / updating my love of working with HTML / CSS

"Graceful degredation" as the opposite of progressive enhancement.

* https://bcd-watch.igalia.com/ : ''Keeping an eye on changes to MDN’s Browser Compatibility Data'' - subscribe to updates via [https://bcd-watch.igalia.com/weekly/feed.rss RSS]

* q: How mature is a feature?
** Flexbox, Anchor Positioning came out and then changed, Grid changed until 2017
** W3C candidate recommendation is a metric
** Do folks here care to know how mature is a feature?
** Do folks here care if a feature they use can or is expected to change in a breaking way in the future?

=== Coming back to making web pages after a long hiatus! ===
 
* Question from Jonathan Wold - has an 18 year old site
** Writing markup, using 11ty as SSG, integrate WordPress
** "The web is way better these days" - Joe
** Making on the web is fun - James
** '''[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ MDN]''' is essential

* Rachel Andrews and Jen Simmons https://labs.jensimmons.com/ are terrific places to start
* https://web.dev/shows/designing-in-the-browser
* How to approach design?
** Design for 1 column using <code>grid</code>, then add breakpoints to use the space - {{artlung}}
** Design to your desired look, then stretch and squish the design and decide how you'd like to alter it
** View source on interesting pages!
** Get your iteration time, the time to writing code and seeing the result - get that interval as short as possible
** Stay inspired! The web is great!

'''Recent site by Joe'''
* https://artlung.com/cssbattles/ - using single grid by default, and then using column-count to maximize space
* using columns is ''mostly'' not great as a reading experience, a bit too paper-newspaper, important to consider how visitors will use and read the site

'''Learning CSS Grid!'''
* https://cssgridgarden.com -- a great game to teach you the basics

* Another Use case for columns - dense links at the tops of pages on:
* https://atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/effects/glasstone-dolan/index.html
* Seismic effects of nuclear weapons
* Fundamental texts ought to be converted to HTML
* Out of print books - full support for internet archive 
* https://bkardell.com/effects-of-nuclear-math/html/ - this is a fork which uses MathML instead of MathJax :) and a post about it https://bkardell.com/blog/NuclearMaths.html
* John Gruber's site is not mobile friendly https://daringfireball.net/
** Mobile browsers have Reader view, which on iOS now includes a "Listen to Page"
* Read aloud button: "Listen to Page"
* Mission: Impossible theme MIDI (M:IDI?): https://bitmidi.com/mission_impossible_theme-mid
* song.link
* archive.is
* bsky.link was an example: https://github.com/capjamesg/bsky.link
* https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver for ArXiv paper pages
* Translation tools can be fed a web page url and translate
* Old toys to translate to pig-latin, or flop a page upside down before <code>scale: -1;</code> was available in CSS.

=== More on video on the web history! ===
** RealPlayer - RealAudio
** Star Wars Prequel downloads
** Apple showcased Quicktime by having a dedicated place one could download trailers for upcoming movies (in a range of filesizes

----
* '''Participate in the Carnival of Mathematics''' from {{fractalkitty}} this month: https://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/
** Share something about math on the web!

=== Some Cool Links To Peruse ===
(potentially worth discussing)
* https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/
* https://ishadeed.com/article/css-relative-colors/
* https://www.builder.io/blog/animated-css-accordions
* https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API
** I wish this had support on iOS - James

=== Closing Thought from {{artlung}} ===
* ''Everyone's carrying around dang web pages in their pockets, make and share a web page with your pal!''
