== Agenda ==
* The agenda is set by the participants!  What HTML & CSS are on your mind today? 
** James is thinking about view transitions (how do they work; and what does browser support look like?)

* Eric's background is the original Space Jam website
* Jen Simmons Space Jam (CSS Grid): https://labs.jensimmons.com/2017/02-015.html
* Original Space Jam (tables galore!): https://www.spacejam.com/1996/

* W3 Breakouts Day
** 30 months is the baseline time before developers take up a tool on the web
** After 30 months features are 95% in the wild

Inspiration for a rebuild of my personal site, refinding / updating my love of working with HTML / CSS

"Graceful degredation" as the opposite of progressive enhancement.

* q: How mature is a feature?
* Flexbox, Anchor Positioning came out and then changed, Grid changed until 2017
* W3C candidate recommendation is a metric
* Do folks here care to know how mature is a feature?
* Do folks here care if a feature they use can or is expected to change in a breaking way in the future?
 
* Question from Jonathan Wold - has an 18 year old site
** Writing markup, using 11ty as SSG, integrate WordPress
** "The web is way better these days" - Joe
** Making on the web is fun - James
** MDN

* Fundamental texts ought to be converted to HTML
* Out of print books - full support for internet archive
