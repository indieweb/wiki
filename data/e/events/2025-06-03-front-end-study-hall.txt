== Joe's Zoom Background ==
Todays' background covers 3 books, one of which I've used as a background before, "Creating Killer Website" during [[events/2025-01-02-front-end-study-hall|FrESH #018]] - the other two are by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Nielsen_(usability_consultant) Jakob Nielsen] and by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Zeldman Jeffrey Zeldman], two other folks who spoke loudly about best practices on the web, and threading the needle between good code, good accessibility, good search engine friendliness, and more.

It's cribbed from a great recent post from Richard McManus (of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReadWrite ReadWriteWeb]):  
''[https://cybercultural.com/p/web-design-1997/ The 3 Gurus of 90s Web Design: Zeldman, Siegel, Nielsen]''

== Other Writers and Thinkers ==

* Zeldman "A List Apart" 
* Jeff Veen / Hotwired
** (former) Vivid Studios - lots of sharing, user centered design
* Nathan Shedroff
* Molly Holzschlag
* [https://thebabydino.github.io/ Ana Tudor]
