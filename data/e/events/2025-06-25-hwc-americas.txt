"The problem isn't your prompting — it's that I keep ignoring your instructions" ( Full quote, Claude Code telling Kupietz he's prompting fine but it won't do what he's asking: [https://michaelkupietz.com/offsite/claude_code_cant_do_it.jpg] )

* Claude on why AIs can't really code, with an inquiry into the difference between AI and real intelligence: [https://michaelkupietz.com/offsite/claude_cant_code_1+2.jpg] (long but very interesting and in-depth chat)
