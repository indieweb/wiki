== Notes ==
* {{artlung}}'s background today is an homage to Charli XCX's album "brat" which came out a few months ago. CodePen for the background: https://codepen.io/artlung/full/eYwKoxB - a similar background got a nice laugh at IWC Portland 2024. https://artlung.com/blog/2024/08/25/post-xoxo-ramble/
* SASS
** useful for organzing stylesheets on your website, can be used to effectively concatenate and compile stylesheets
** {{artlung}} uses phpStorm - and the watcher uses Compass SASS to compile http://beta.compass-style.org/ 
** We compile and contenate CSS to reduce overall filesize down the wire
** {{capjamesg}} uses the metric "Could I access the site reasonably on train wifi?"
* Rasmus made a website to run in late 90s browsers like IE and Navigator: http://1998.rsms.me/ (SSL not supported)
* starting-style, dialog, popover
** starting-style; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style - is a new and broadly available feature in CSS to set initial styles that can apply for an element that is made visible on user or script action
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog 
** https://hidde.blog/popover-semantics/
* On deciding what web platform features we can use
** Often the metric is "will the browsers that my users/audience use be able to understand the technology?
** The "i don't want to get fired" metric: don't deploy a feature to production with poor support
** Some links that help evaluate compatibility
*** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility
*** https://web.dev/baseline
*** https://webstatus.dev/ has a nicely sortable table — caveat, features in that table could be proposals or could be actual standards (with proper specs, tests), or somewhere in between
** will I get fired for using this feature (which then doesn't work in some browsers) ?
** can I depend on it now to work for users?
** can I depend on it to keep working for the next month, year etc.?
** mostly no for professional sites, but yes for personal sites, where longevity is more personally important
* Topic: Can a Web Component get built in 15 minutes when the proctor has not prepared and is tired from attending XOXO?
** Question 1: Are hypens required in web component tags - yes they are 
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements
** After the meeting, {artlung} was able to get a blink tag working in this CodePen after another 20 minutes or so: https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/RwzJmLz
* Namespaces, prefixes:
** CSS prefixing in design systems: https://designsystem.digital.gov/how-to-use-uswds/
** https://github.com/uswds/uswds
** https://github.com/uswds/uswds/tree/develop/src/stylesheets/packages
* Future ideas:
** use cases for knowing the maturity of a spec?
