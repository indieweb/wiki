== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!
* Manny has thought about audio element a bit, leaving it as is. FrESH (discussed in [[events/2025-07-01-front-end-study-hall#Audio_Tag_Styling_HOWTO]] )
* Manny wrote https://mandarismoore.com/2025/07/14/be-my-bimi.html about BIMI
* {{rossabaker}} has a new paginator in Hugo with "binary search"
** See in action at https://rossabaker.com/notes/
** Documentation forthcoming
* 
* {{artlung}} wrote an indienews post in response to {{capjamesg}}'s post about repurposing Wiki content for other purposes https://artlung.com/blog/2025/07/15/return-to-mashups/

* James would like an alt text master guide
* How do you do alt text for comics?
** Writing a transcript of the comics?
*** Example of transcripts for comics: https://www.runawaytothestars.com/
*** Superimposing the text on the comics: https://falseknees.com
** Make a novel or short story adaption of the comic in prose? More work, but gives all the details a reader would need.
* A perspective on alt text for memes: https://adrianroselli.com/2018/04/accessible-memes-can-be-done.html
* Alt text selfies: https://alttextselfies.net/
* https://www.digitala11y.com/wai-aria-rolecaption/ role=caption
* https://veroniiiica.com/how-to-write-alt-text-image-descriptions-visually-impaired/
* Hitchiker's guide has been told as television/film/novels/other mediums; each has constraints which means they are all slightly different, but all convey the feel of the story.
* Sometimes artists want to let a work be; putting something into words may be really difficult.

* Potentially a fun challenge: share a blog post and ask a friend to write the alt text!
* One of James' blog posts on art: https://jamesg.blog/2024/09/23/fernande-with-a-black-mantilla
** I don't write rich alt text of the art because the text around describes the painting
** But what I writes may not be an exact match of the painting, so richer alt text may be valuable too

* Publishing alt text as a visible element on / next to images on our website
* Mastodon shows an "alt" button that appears over an image in the top right corner
* On Instagram some users write a visual description below an image
* Could details/summary tags be used

* We played marco/polo

* https://michaelkupietz.com/web-assets-buttons-logos-and-other-website-graphics/
* Michael made an "The eyes have it" widget that follows your cursor.
* https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeyes
* Sophia shared a CodePen of eyes that follow your cursor where youc an click to add another eye

Back on topic button: https://dead.garden/art/img/hwc-back-on-topic.png

* Sophia is working on a parametric font (and may blog about it in the future!)
** Also wrote a blog post for the Carnival: https://www.fractalkitty.com/take-two-2/
** And is building a website that is a slide show using reveal.js (https://revealjs.com/)!
** reveal.js supports changing the background image on a page
**example slideshow: https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/pen/VYwemJJ

* Could there be / is there a slide show tool that lets you make web slide shows that are only HTML/CSS (no JS)?
** Not sure what this uses but it's an interesting variant: https://www.robinsloan.com/tap/tour/
* Presenting a slide show as a blog post
* Link "rel"s for presentations
* {{rossabaker}} showed a setup that converts Org Mode to a slide show
** https://git.rossabaker.com/ross/cromulent/commit/7e2e00e68cf83ac87b63a9851d65f0cc64917e5b
** Will eventually be viewable at https://rossabaker.com/presentations/scala-variance
** And worked on pagination where the paginator is a binary search

* Carnivals this month
** https://marksuth.dev/posts/2025/07/indieweb-movie-club-july-2025-triplets-bellville
** https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/2025/07/01/1
** Emacs Carnival: https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/

* image-rendering pixelated is useful for pixel art / small buttons https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering
* https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/image-upsizing-with-svg/
* From last week at the Americas:
  img[width="88"][height="31"] { image-rendering: pixelated } 

* Challenge of someone embedding your button not looking as good on their website as yours if you use image-rendering: pixelated (because everyone who embeds it needs the tag for it to be seen the same)

* James just tried image-rendering pixelated and buttons look so much better!
* ... add notes
* https://learntheweb.courses/topics/responsive-retina-images/
* Michael notes a wish to specify DPI for an image
* Tantek notes that it could be helpful to have a "preserve pixels" mode for an image, in the image's file metadata itself
* https://michaelkupietz.com/getting-web-browsers-not-to-blur-images-on-retina-screens/
* {{artlung}} built a thing demonstrating sliders for a CodePenChallenge with random pinwheels
** https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/PwPqXLw
* eventually will go to my lab and probably retain state

* What is the blog post equivalent of a mashup?
* Idea for a mashup post: a photo of mashed potatoes
* "before we go too much down the starches"

* James' blog post on mashups: https://jamesg.blog/2025/07/16/mashups, inspired by Joe's "Return to Mashups" blog post: https://artlung.com/blog/2025/07/15/return-to-mashups/
* Prior writing by James on this topic: https://jamesg.blog/2024/11/12/musical-concepts-blogging

((omg Mark's cat is hilarious))

* Formatting for blockquotes (showing favicons of the person who you are quoting?)
** Matt Webb & Tom Critchlow
** You could have multiple nested blockquotes

* Writing a blog post that mashes up two people's perspectives on a topic, then writing your own perspective

* https://gwern.net/sidenote adds a Wikipedia logo (the W letter) to the end of Wikipedia links, "FF" in superscript for Firefox documentation; maybe other examples too.

* "I shut down my etsy store" - Sophia
** What does it look like to do commerce without etsy?
** Shopify/Stripe don't feel better than etsy
** Two suggestions: https://payhip.com and https://ko-fi.com
** Robin Sloan uses his site and a free version of Shopify: https://www.robinsloan.com/shop/
*** https://store.mollywhite.net/
** Could also try a page on your site and just a stripe or paypal button or both???
** Could also try asking Derek Sivers about his setup: https://sivers.com/
** Bandcamp alternative FairCamp
*** https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/
** WooCommerce exists for WordPress
*** {{gwg}} set up a Woocommerce site, which uses Stripe only as a payment gateway, to sell keyboard components at mechdreams.com. Wouldn't mind going even further in self-hosted, but note...too indieweb might scare people in regard to payment processing at last. Fulfillment isn't an issue. Wouldn't mind looking for moving more off complicated solutions.
* Now defunct but: https://dev.banchan.art/about-us
** https://prestashop.com/
** https://www.opencart.com/ (maintainer may not be helpful in GitHub Issues)
** Mark demo'ed OpenCart showing it has many features
** You could also design a /shop page on your website and use an eCommerce tool as the back-end (i.e. Stripe for payment)
* https://mayhem.my/
* https://artisans.coop/
* https://gumroad.com/
* WooCommerce can make you feel trapped in WP because your shop is set up with WP
* etsy has a discovery element: it's hard to get discovered because it's massive
* Designing for trust while giving your own personality

* Stripe documentation for payment links: https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links

* indieweb market / makers: a list of people who make independent things that you can buy
** Like Andy Carolan's stickers, the Good Internet Magazine, the Internet Phone Book, other physical things / software 
** community stuff like: IndieWeb t-shirts / stickers
** This could be a fun blogging prompt ^^ write about web creators you follow who also sell things

* IndieWeb sticker/tshirt store: https://indieweb.printful.me/ (https://shop.indieweb.org)

* Should the homepage/sidebar have a link to the IndieWeb shop?
** "t-shirt" with t-shirt emoji

* Question from Sophia: Has anyone run a "junior IndieWebCamp"?
** Mark has worked with younger people in summer school to make a website as part of the school programme
** Parents have brought children to both in-person HWCs and online IndieWeb events in the past

** The rain venue is the Ikea Brooklyn Living Room area?

* Offline Camp: https://offlinefirst.org/camp/

* What tools do we use to write offline?
** James uses Typora (https://typora.io); having an offline-capable website is helpful for being able to reference his own materials.
* Radical mundane claim: WE CAN WRITE BLOG POSTS WITHOUT CONNECTIVITY
* Thomas' writing process: https://vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=2124
* IA Writer works offline

Are there 88x31 buttons for locations, like SF, NYC, Paris, Rome?

* Thomas made https://lab.vanderwal.net/sticker_sample.html with badges of different sizes during HWC today
** Flower icon is from the Noun Project
* What would a "blog travel" page look like where you collect different size buttons by web makers?
* Related: fridge magnets, laptop stickers
* You could have a code snippet that makes it easy for someone to copy your sticker
* You could animate the stickers so that they change on hover, click, etc.

* Create a /travel-stubs page that lists stubs from museums/galleries/tickets/concerts, etc.?
** Reminds me of Paul's jacket pins: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/info/version

* Zachary is interested in an online https://html.energy/ event
** Online events can be accessible -- not everyone can/wants to travel

* Kupietz posted the Photoshop PSD template for the "Build During An Indieweb Meetup" 88x31 button: https://michaelkupietz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/built-during-indieweb-button.psd

* Everyone is welcome to host an IndieWeb event!
** There are opportunities for events in many axes
** A meetup for people who speak Spanish?
** A back-end study hall?
** An accessibility study hall?

* Front-End Study Hall has a finite 90 minute format.
* Tantek does espresso live streams which are informal chats that a few community members have joined
