It is possible to create the user page in the wiki, but we will see in the history, who created it. It is possibly not possible to spoof that (at least we could not figure out the way to do it). It  is harder, since there is less spam than on the other MediaWiki instances. 

What {{artlung}} made that was hip this past week:
* Updated my page https://artlung.com/headers/ which is my dead headers page which encompasses 20 years of the headers from my website and blog. I make headers periodically. Some years I have made none. At the beginning I had a lot of fun making them very regularly.
* To see the whole history of headers there's a column of them dynamically updated at https://artlung.com/archive/
* I blogged this week about revamping my headers page and why I've made them Happy Tuesdays and Dead Headers
* I did *not* blog about an excellent tool I started using this week to make website screenshots: https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper by Simon Willison - I was able to use it to semi-automate the capture of the headers because it can focus a particular dom element and get a screenshot of it

I believe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot was the first "streamed" internet video. At Cambridge!

FamilySearch dot org is a free global service provided by the LDS church - https://www.familysearch.org/ - it's been useful to me and finding information about ancestors. I blogged about this the other day: "I woke up to find out a 4th great-granduncle was murdered in San Juan Capistrano": https://artlung.com/blog/2024/02/
