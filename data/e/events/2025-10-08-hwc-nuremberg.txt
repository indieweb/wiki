This HWC had fewer participants than normal for different reasons, but we'll try to improve that on the next date!

Usually we try to create things, but this time it started with some destructive fun on [https://www.fuckupmysite.com Fuckup My Site]. Afterwards there were some iscussions about design update options for the [https://www.maxhaesslein.de/changelog/ changelog on Max' website] which were immediately implemented. It looks much cleaner now.

Then there was some marvelling at the nerdy UI goodness on the [https://hypr.land/hall_of_fame/ Hyprland Hall of Fame].

Even some non-digital assets were discussed: [https://internetphonebook.net/ The Internet Phone Book] has arrived in printed tree form and [https://goodinternetmagazine.com another printed magazine about the personal-website-verse] made its way to the HWC.
