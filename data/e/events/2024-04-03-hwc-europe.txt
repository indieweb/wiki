* CSS validator: https://validator.w3.org/nu
* Chrome's Dev Tools for CSS: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/

CSS debugging and validating
* Browser dev tools do a decent job warning if you mistyped a selector, if you "Inspect Element" the style panel should show the property crossed out or with a warning symbol. E.g. if you had `font-color: #000` it should be crossed out because the correct property is `color: #000`
* https://validator.w3.org/nu validate CSS by URL input or direct copy/paste

* Unexpected source of advocating for creativity in structured ways: https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/
** Written from the original Agile/Rails crew
** Biggest takeaway: learn to balance linear goal-oriented thinking with right-brained open-ended experimental work. And have a good balance of both, because linear thinking will shortcut the creativity in open-ended thinking.

* {{capjamesg}} suggested that {{alabut}} write a blog post about "creativity over organization": GTD, Obsidian, second brain vs writing, James' love of classification and his home-grown tool for exploring interesting new ideas amongst his writing.
