* Joe went through the basic flow:
** checked out repo gh repo clone omnibear/omnibear
** immediately ran the run command and got an error sh: wxt: command not found
** then ran npm install and tried again
** was able to validate the flow, running it opened the omnibear webpage - maybe wxt.config.ts could be edited to open a page with some instructions for someone trying out the extension or who just in
*** 
* Opened Issues
** [https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear/issues/131 Internationalization]
** [https://github.com/omnibear/omnibear/issues/132 Install prompt page]

* Questions: running it defaults to Chrome! 
** Add instructions to alter run command to choose which browser to target? (Chrome, Firefox, maybe even Edge?)
* Website feedback
** Rework primary description, less jargon to start
** An animated video instead of a screenshot that shows how 
** Joe recommends avif for video
** Joe runs this: ffmpeg -i Dream-0319.mp4 -crf 32 -r 8 -vf scale=200:-1 Dream-0319.avif; 
** # note that command scales the image down - maybe scale can be removed
** also given the palette gif could work, similar command but with gif extension
** Copy edit on website: "OmniBear allows you to..."
