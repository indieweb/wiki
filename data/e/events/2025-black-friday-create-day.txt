* I expect folks can help with that elliot. maybe using netlify is my first thought
hey joe, thx for the support. oh hey, I dig the links u shared w me btw also wanted to mention, I think you have a broken pic link on your Alice Street entry. (what's the link for htat) 
yup, will chck the netlify thang.
I'm diggin that smallweb movement. small is the new big!
joe, if u go to your Art section, see Alice Street (2012), appears broken on both my cell and my laptop
* https://artlung.com/art/#alice-street seems fine to me, but thanks for looking
** https://issues.chromium.org/issues/362539762 "specific avif file doesn't display"
oh yeah sure. I guess its on my end, but thot u may want to know.
* Jeremy popped into the Zoom for a while - has documented progress mining EXIF data and right-sizing images on his Hugo site and getting storage improvements
* {{jeremycherfas}} came back from his walk and announced his intention to deploy his Hugo photo gallery, avoid customisation, and write it up.
* And here it is https://photos.jeremycherfas.net/

* hiii i'm kat in the zoom meeting :] i'm {{eunoia.sayitditto.net}} on the wiki (i hope i did that right)
yeah open source is like, i have super mixed feelings because of the like human parts of it all, people are so entitled that's what gets me the most. yesss i'd love to read your thoughts on it!
(talking about this post i made: https://bubblegum.girlonthemoon.xyz/articles/it-s-all-just-bullshit)
* {{artlung}} notes that he has an intent to write about a great talk given this year about the human realities of open source, if you're curious to watch and listen to the talk start here https://mastodon.social/@lauchgott/114722355945638707
* something i've been experimenting with is seeing how to make indieweb stuff more friendly to fandom people like me, especially since i work with fujocoded as a sysadmin (our goal is getting fandom people into coding!). we work a lot with SSGs (mainly astro) and making languages like java/typescript friendly to fans and so lately i've been wondering how i could port my hundreds of fanfictions to my personal website without it being so manual. one thing that comes to mind is the astro loader for AO3 and other sites (such as my own which uses the AO3 code) which can eliminate a lot of the manual work and make it easier to load in from other sites. just some thought :)
https://github.com/FujoWebDev/ao3-content-layer-example
** great stuff, I know sara is active in ao3 https://sarajaksa.eu/ 
YAYY another indieweb fandom person, that's super exciting! feels like there aren't enough of us
i think something maybe worth discussing is how fandom is so like, how to put it.... it's very horny. lol. and there's something to be said about how indieweb stuff can free us from corporate site constraints (like being so payment processor friendly it hurts NSFW artists)
** There are also DIY guides for fanfiction that can be IndieWeb related. A lot of them are specific HTML and CSS related, but there are also ones like this one https://melannen.dreamwidth.org/534629.html , that tells you how to create your own Fanfiction archive
* yes for sure, documenting how and why ao3 and site integrations can work and what they mean to community members is good. I added the project to [[Archive_of_our_own]] page
* as to the "horny" bit all that's cool but when sharing a nominal content warning will be cool too :-) 
awesome! ah yes sorry i should've noted that AO3 is Like That haha i'm just so used to it and people also knowing it that i forget
* {{artlung}} is an old hand on the internet so fully aware that the a wide range of human creativity is represented!
* i added the AO3.js library to the AO3 wiki page :) excellent!
* {{artlung}} made some headway on https://artlung.com/mixtapes/ with some layout changes
awesome! that page inspires me a lot, i really wanna start archiving my mixes
* yeah, a good mix is great for helping me remember, but also I want to add more comments, like why I started listening to something and what the mix meant to me and I think I have a better way to dot that. a little markdown file associated goes a long way. right now I have HTML stuck in one large yaml file and that kinda sucks so I want to make it easier to add notes for myself with some small markdown files
that'd be really cool :) sometimes i do little "liner notes" or like author notes i guess on my mixes, see here https://illcocytus.dreamwidth.org/ - KPOP GALORE! Nice. Or wait, KPOP or am I wrong about origins
kpop, jpop, basically anything i like which is a lot :D i love japanese idols so i like to put their songs in my mixes too
HTML in YAML sounds scary - YES IT WAS A MISTAKE :-) 

* {{nsmsn}} joined around 8:30 am Mountain Time (US). Nick's working on styling a few default HTML elements, cleaning up the bits that look janky on https://www.nicksimson.com/html
** Your font! I love it. I can feel it deep in my bones hah
* {{artlung}} is cleaning up the multiple ways his mixtapes are assembled - moving to cleaner php + twig templates
* {{mossymaker}} hosting: trying to consolidate services to a VPS from a couple vercel-likes; have an ansible playbook that describes everything (https://github.com/Mati365/hetzner-podman-bunjs-deploy)
* {{vanderwal}} working on building local search in my lab to search just my blog and have an output screen. Focusing on this for a short stretch, then a break and then back later.
** Dropping for a while,  back on later
** Returned and on my Lab page, https://lab.vanderwal.net/index.html, I have added a link to the initial search lab page, which has a results page I'm fine with for now. I need to sort out a few more things, like where to put search on my main blog site and some additions to the results page to filter by date and categories.

Just saying hi atm while I get myself oriented
-Medjed
** hi :) 
OMGGG YALL GOT FUJOS HERE???? YALL KNOW THERES A FUJO WEBRING RIGHT? https://fujoringout.nekoweb.org/
Nekoweb is where I host my site I love it a lot cause the rss feed can put you on the main page as well
What do you mean? Like a redirect of some kind? 
I mean it's called the global feed. Basically they show the title and the summary/description in a little rectangle. Not many people use it surprisingly but it's always been really chill since it started :) (sorry I didn't see that I got disconnected)
{CrowderSoup / Aaron}: I'm working on the styling for my photo posts. I think I will also spend some time working on my Micropub endpoint using micropub.rocks to validate.

On the topic of buying web fonts, SimpleBits has a great simple license for their fonts: https://simplebits.com/licenses/

On the topic of badges and gamification: [[badge]]

* {{capjamesg}} is here and figuring out what to build!

* {{gRegor}} didn't come with a specific goal, so ideas will just come to me:
** ✔️ add this URL input field auto completion: https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/03/4/url-form-field
** ✔️ update my article permalinks on https://gregorlove.com to the latest layout most of my site is using
** ✔️ post about today's updates: https://gregorlove.com/2025/11/for-todays-indieweb-create/

* {{angelo}} is:
** updating site search to include web results when signed in as admin -- using Google Custom Search JSON API
*** "Custom Search JSON API provides 100 search queries per day for free. ... Additional requests cost $5 per 1000 queries, up to 10k queries per day."
** adding render of swatch for hex color search query
** moving from etherpad (OT) to y.js (CRDT) for personal post editor

elliot here again. hey, anyone have a quick 5-step (or less) instruction list on how to spin up a simple elegant SELFHOSTED minimalist site for text and image (jpeg, png) for the non dev/indieweb community members like myself to CREATE today in 1hr or less?

Designer/dev is documenting his journey in ditching Tailwind for work and going pure CSS-only:
https://aaadaaam.com/

== Sounds ==
    
Sound designer that created iPhone ringtones that were so good that they got him hired at Apple to redesign all of the sounds (and he still works with Jony Ive now at LoveFrom): https://www.hugoverweij.com/

Microsite for the sounds: https://cleartones.net/
About page explains the rationale of the design and frustrations with the then-current state of casino-like annoying soundscape on iOS: https://cleartones.net/about

More history on the sounds of Apple devices:

* https://thenextweb.com/news/how-apples-text-alert-sound-was-created-8-years-before-the-iphone-existed

* https://jamesg.blog/validate-everything?url=https%3A%2F%2Falabut.com

* JS way to "view source" from a website: https://stackoverflow.com/a/41945138

Do a view source on James' website to see some very well-written comments. It's like documenting your HTML as you go along.

Nick changed some table styles and built an indieweb "hat" page with a table (WIP): https://nicksimson.com/hats.html 
* Dropping off at 1:45pm local time to pick up his kid.

* {{patoyson}} is popping in and out of the ethernet (and hopefully joining the Zoom at some point). 
* * I am working on forking 'hacker typer' to simulate hacking for TTRPGs and hosting that on my website as a nifty tool. Forking from: https://codepen.io/Play-Games-davi/details/ByNLrOb

* https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/EaKbEGE (animating a mask: a few kinds)

* James has finished https://jamesg.blog/validate-everything !
* The source code is available at https://github.com/capjamesg/validate-everything

* CrowderSoup has all but 8 https://micropub.rocks tests passing for his Django micropub implementation at https://crowdersoup.com/micropub

* CrowderSoup decided to add a styled 4xx and 5xx error page to his site.

* Angelo

* James wrote a blog post about his project at https://jamesg.blog/validate-everything

* The WCAG criteria is for authors to allow the text to zoom a certain size based on user preference https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html (and certain CSS techniques can PREVENT this) and related https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20-TECHS/G179.html

* micropub.rocks test issues
** https://github.com/aaronpk/micropub.rocks/issues/101
** https://github.com/aaronpk/micropub.rocks/issues/122
** https://github.com/aaronpk/micropub.rocks/issues/104

* Sara
** drew for a virutal quilt and wrote a blog post about it: https://sarajaksa.eu/2025/11/i-created-something-for-aspec-quilt-project/
** fixed the code I am using to subscribe to AO3 through RSS feeds 

* {{artlung}} has got his mixtapes page working and has a rational process for adding writing about my mixtapes onto them. https://artlung.com/mixtapes/i-find-your-lack-of-words-disturbing I had prior had html in yaml which was very painful to edit and change, I also added some unit tests to assure that when I make changes in the future I won't break things

{{morganwebdev.org}}
- Morgan is working on a small side project called https://guideline-journey.com

SustyIcons: Inspired by Al's minimal examples
