{{bjoern}} showed how he updated [[Eleventy]] on his website backend from 2.0 to 3.0 using [http://Cursor Cursor] to help with the necessary async changes.

Max changed the code on his changelog site to use [[Kirby]] structured content. This allows him to create entries which get sorted by date automatically. He plans to apply this to his photo library as well.

Philip did some changes on his website. His goal is to add a profile page with some press ready material.

We also had a lot of fun with Alex' little thermo printer and printed out some web sites.
