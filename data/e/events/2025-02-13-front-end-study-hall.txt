=== Joe's Zoom Background ===
* {{artlung}}'s background today is a screenshot of the article that popularized the term "Ajax" in web development circles: https://web.archive.org/web/20151008003352/http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/

/* example code that leaves brighter questions which are unanswers, Thanks Thomas Van Der Wal for talking about expected UX flow -- namely, to *encourage* users to interact with the fields they have not yet interacted with - that is, to complete the quiz */

* Designing the interaction, 
* ... add notes

Tantek brings up Indeterminate as a CSS pseudo-class that can mark form elements that have not been interacted with 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:indeterminate

History:
* Introduction of :indeterminate pseudo-class in a CSS draft: https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-css3-userint-20000216#pseudo-indeterminate (note previous draft asked the question of should we have :indeterminate, for the first public mention of the idea)
* Radio and checkbox inputs (tested in Safari) that are part of a form are marked as :user-valid no matter their :checked state when the form is submitted
