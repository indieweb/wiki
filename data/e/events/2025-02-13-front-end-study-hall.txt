== Joe's Zoom Background ==
* {{artlung}}'s background today is a screenshot of the article that popularized the term "Ajax" in web development circles: https://web.archive.org/web/20151008003352/http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)
** Ajax "asynchronous JavaScript and XML"
** XMLHttpRequest https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest made it possible
** Makes webpages able to pull server resources and enables web applications that don't require a page refresh
** Today, the Fetch API is widely available and far simpler to program with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

== Topics Today? ==

=== New Open Source Font ===
* {{rossabaker}} has been building custom fonts and pondering the readability of "quasi-proportional" for body text: https://typeof.net/Iosevka/
** https://xeiaso.net/blog/iaso-fonts/
** https://protesilaos.com/emacs/aporetic-fonts-pictures
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-synthesis

=== Accessibility? ===
* More general principles of accessbility from Heydon Pickering
** * https://github.com/Heydon/principles-of-web-accessibility

=== Reviewing "What HTML element" Quiz ===
* '''James made a "What HTML element are you (a quiz)" https://jamesg.blog/2025/02/13/html-quiz'''
** I wouldn't mind a quick check to see if I am using the right HTML elements!
** HTML validation: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjamesg.blog%2F2025%2F02%2F13%2Fhtml-quiz

*** CodePen to play with the form itself https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/WbNbKJm
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid
** checkValidity and reportValidity

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-invalid
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-valid

* reset button -- resets to initial state of the form https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/reset
** kind of annoying without error prevention but useful?
* {{t}}'s homework question: 
** Which came first? [required] or aria-required ? 

/* example code that leaves brighter questions which are unanswers, Thanks Thomas for talking about expected UX flow -- namely, to *encourage* users to interact with the fields they have not yet interacted with - that is, to complete the quiz */
<pre>
body {
  background: #aaa;
}
fieldset {
  outline: 10px solid green;
  background: transparent;
}
fieldset:not(:has(input:checked)) {
  background: white;
  outline: 10px solid red;
}
</pre>
* Designing the interaction, 

* Tantek brings up Indeterminate as a CSS pseudo-class that can mark form elements that have not been interacted with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:indeterminate

==== History ====
* Introduction of :indeterminate pseudo-class in a CSS draft: https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-css3-userint-20000216#pseudo-indeterminate (note previous draft asked the question of should we have :indeterminate, for the first public mention of the idea)
* Radio and checkbox inputs (tested in Safari) that are part of a form are marked as :user-valid no matter their :checked state when the form is submitted
