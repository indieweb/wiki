'''<dfn>[https://events.indieweb.org/2025/04/homebrew-website-club-nuremberg-germany-JVnsbe2yMg56 Homebrew Website Club Nürnberg]</dfn>''' was an IndieWeb meetup in real life that took place on 2025-04-12.

We were once again very happy to be hosted by [https://leonardo-zentrum.de/ LEONARDO - Zentrum für Kreativität und Innovation].

== Participants ==

* {{bjoern}} - https://bjoern.stierand.org/
* Tilman Zitzmann - https://tilman.me/
* Max Häßlein - https://www.maxhaesslein.de/
* Philip Saa - https://mc.scrpt.live/
* Simona Leyzerovich- https://www.zimoshka.de/
* René Breckner - https://dc3.me/

== Notes ==

As René is with us for the first time, we show him the current incarnation of our web sites (and the tooling behind them).

René shows his daily notes tool 'Dairy Card 3' he built to track various aspects of his life and do journaling and also tells us the interesting story behind it.

Philip presented his 'over-engineered' Dachboden Sessions project update and his interactive map which is now fully styled in classic Mac look. He also plans to redo his web site with a new font from Benjie Escobar.

Max added a new feature to his Terminfinder that adds a weighting to date selections so votes from people who really want to attend get weighted higher than tentative votes.

In the end we discussed the text we want to use for the Nuremberg Digital Festival edition of our meeting and complained about the new web design of the Z-Bau.
