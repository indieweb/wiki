** I have wanted to have a styled * * * section break element on my site for a while. Maybe it should be a HTML web component? - that's called a Dinkus - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus
** Maybe use the ::before selector on a hr - that's how I did mine (used :after rather than :before, but...)
