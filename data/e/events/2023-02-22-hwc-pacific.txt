** {{aciccarello}} is looking at fixing an issue where it doesn't pick up fed.brid.gy links
** self mentions could be a option/flag
* What use cases are there for image webmentions?
** Stats, notification
** Done via http header (per spec)

* [[2021/Pop-ups/Webmentions_Beyond_Webmention.io]] was related (but doesn't address caching)
* We should do anther popup soon!
** See [[2023/Pop-ups/Sessions]]
* Should we consider adopting the Open Graph Protocol standard?
* There are a lot of properties that are likely never used
* How do we encourage IndieAuth adoption from the broader D-Web space
* There's very little understanding of IndieWeb concepts in the meetups/conferences
* Even for projects with a federation setup, what tools/protocols could be used across these communities
* Some of the vocabulary/principles of the IndieWeb don't fit with d-web community
* Lots of projects in the d-web community revolve around roadmaps and project leads which is different than the IndieWeb ethos of imprlementation first, spec later

* {{benji}} Added a [https://webmention.netlify.app/check?url=https://benji.dog/notes/1676435700 Check Endpoint] to his fork of webmention.app for debugging
* D-web projects are looking to THE project with all the momentum, development, users, and hype
* IndieWeb principles tend to be less capitalistic, winner-takes-all
* How could a service make it easy to get set up with the IndieWeb?
* Micro.blog is our obvious example
* There's not really a "free trial" for creating websites
* Squarespace makes it easy to sign up for a domain but is not very flexible
* Wordpress is both easy to sign up for and customizable, but complicated to set up
* We could make a d-web/fediverse site that requires indieauth/webmentions to post ðŸ˜„ (like indieweb.xyz)
