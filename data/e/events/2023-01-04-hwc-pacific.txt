{{gRegor}}: Tracy, The error WordPress shows me is:
* "cURL error 28: Connection timeout after 10001 ms"
* Sending webmention to: https://tracydurnell.com/2023/01/03/gifting-art/
* but it happens after 2-3 seconds, not 10 seconds.
** {{tracydurnell}}: resolution was webhost allowlisting something and updating php (pending confirmation it worked)
*** {{gRegor}}: I just tried again and unfortunately got the same error :/
