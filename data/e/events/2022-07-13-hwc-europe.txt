=== IndieWeb Search ===

https://indieweb-search.jamesg.blog/
Indexing is resource-demanding, but searching itself is ok, can be run on home hardware. Ranking is a problem.
The currently most effective ranking algorithm is to look for keywords and then rank according to number of incoming links.

Ranking algorithm weight:

A microformat standard for search results could help.

https://www.marginalia.nu/ is developing an independent search engine and sharing experiences. You'll find some logs about it here: https://memex.marginalia.nu/topic/programming.gmi
