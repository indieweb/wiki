== Notes ==
* It's a night of football in the UK tonight
* What we're doing on our websites this week
** Mark changed the fonts on his website
** Joe is thinking about colour schemes
** {{artlung}} also added the WordPress plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/index-wp-mysql-for-speed/ which provided some increased database performance and doublechecked some indices which were missing
* What is Webmention and how it works
** [[Webmention]]
* Design, look and feel, typography
** Trains in UK use a particular font
*** http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/manual.htm
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Alphabet (British Rail font)
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_(typeface) (London Underground Font)
*** {{artlung}} bought a copy of the font at the Transport museum in London 20 years ago and incorporated it into some headers on his site https://artlung.com/headers/-20040103
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_(typeface) (UK Road signs & UK Government font)
* Tantek has been enhancing how he displays explicitly curated comments imported from webmentions and Bridgy Fed and documenting them in [[comments]]

* aside: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function

* Tantek is considering writing a post on More Thoughtful Curated Comments regarding his thinking and process how he added comments to his "Responsible Inventing" post, as a bit of a follow-on from his prior article on "[https://tantek.com/2023/277/b1/thoughtful-reading-writing-web  More Thoughtful Reading & Writing on the Web]"

* {{lazcorp}} is in the (difficult) middle of implementing ActivityPub for his website, including the profile page, and is working on mapping his content types to their Fediverse equivalents
* Quality no quantity; Infrequent vs Frequent
** e.g.: A Life Well Wasted https://alifewellwasted.com/ -- a no-ads podcast -- had a decade-long hiatus https://www.vice.com/en/article/akemag/robert-ashley-on-the-return-of-a-life-well-wasted
* James' new table styles reminds me that centering column headers is something Joel Spolsky does in his talk "
You Suck at Excel "  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxBg4sMusIg
* Typography expert Richard Rutter https://book.webtypography.net/ "The Web Typography Book"
https://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm
* "So many feed readers, so many bizarre behaviors" by https://rachelbythebay.com/ https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/05/27/feed/
