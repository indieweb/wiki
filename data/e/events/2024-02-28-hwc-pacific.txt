* Extracting a "primary" pallette from screenshots: https://artlung.com/blog/2024/02/26/extracting-hex-color-php/ 
** Color Extractor Library in PHP https://github.com/thephpleague/color-extractor
** The source headers I made are these: https://artlung.com/headers/ and I used that library to create CSS vars to use on the site to complement the header
** https://lab.artlung.com/random-cells/ is a thing I built a long time ago to generate a random string to tweet - it uses a random hex color generator and generates a color that will have adequate contrast on top of it.
** Unfortunately I don't have a comment in the code as to where I got the algorithm. Here's a post which includes some different approaches : https://www.splitbrain.org/blog/2008-09/18-calculating_color_contrast_with_php
