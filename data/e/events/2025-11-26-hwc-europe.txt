 (ah, the new web smell...)
* Joe is working with video on his website right now
** Optimising videos at different sizes

* James is building out a list of links on his site, but not a full bookmarks list
** And experimenting with the backdrop-filter CSS rule
* Eri added a second colour to their website https://conflor.es/

== Fun ==

* [[lulz]]

== Question: How to integrate a calendar on your personal site? == 
* {{gwg}} is thinking of replacing Nextcloud, specifically the calendar
* It can get complicated between if you've RSVP'd or just want to hear about it
* RSVP webmention is a good way to keep track of events you have gone to if you want to create a public list of those things
** specific example: indicate he's attending an HWC and make it compelling for other people finding the event
** {{gRegor}} has used RSVP posts to add some additional context before, example: https://gregorlove.com/2022/01/im-attending-homebrew-website-club/ specifically with the intent of sharing on Twitter and perhaps getting someone's attention
* https://tantek.com/ has a calendar on his website and has a link to a webcal
* You could also write a blog post about an event you're going to
* You have to think about what you are comfortable sharing

* How do you find your own angle on a specific kind of post like photos/events/RSVPs/notes, etc.?
* Be gentle with yourself about not being sure about how to approach something!

== Web Day Portland ==
* https://reeds.website/2025/webday/
** A few people showed up to the event
** One person went in without a website and left with a website!
** Interested in fun/exploration vibe rather than specifically teaching
** Interested in making a web page as a group
** Used CSS box shadow to make the main column bleed into the edges
** Page has an [[easter_egg]] too!
** https://reeds.website/2025/websiteworkshop/guide -- a guide on making a personal website, called the "Personal Website Survival Guide"
*** Hoping to make the page a printable zine with print CSS
*** it's awfully close to print-ready and suitable to be added to [[zine]] ! nice!
** gRegor: feel free to add the Web Day event on events.indieweb.org! You can sign in using web-sign-in: [[Web_sign-in]]
** [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain]] has some instructions too

== CSS ==
** https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLUnknownElement
* Browsers routearound tags that don't exist in the HTML spec
* Custom tags don't have semantic meaning, but can be really useful for layout
* Useful tool: to view the accessibility tree to see what a11y features your site has https://www.canidev.tools/view-accessibility-tree?category=Accessibility

== Web maps ==

* Re: the pink, would you call that a Pink Bloggy Club? -- gRegor
** This is an amazing idea :D
* Image may resizing: github.com/davidjbradshaw/image-map-resizer
* You could add the "End of the Internet" page on your "next" page: https://hmpg.net/
* Doctor Who zine: https://archive.org/details/inallbutname

==Quotable==
* Zines thrive at niche - James
* "I make a point of memorising every URL."
