After some planning talk for the Nürnberg Digital Festival (during which the next HWC Nuremberg will take place), we talked a bit about progessive enhancements and innovation culture. We got to the point that the motivation to innovate and to expand ones own knowledge is intrinsic and hard to implement from the outside.

Max showed the current state of the soundboard he build for his TTRPG games. You can add multiple boards to it (so you can have one for permanent sounds like rain and wind, which can be mixed and played side-by-side and another one for individual sound bits), add YouTube videos directly and cross-fade between tracks. There are some features still missing, but it already looks quite cool.
He also added a feature to his website to jump directly to the main content when pressing Tab and Enter and he added anchor links to every image, so you can share a link and jump directly to the corresponding photo.

{{bjoern}} finally added a working RSS feed to his website. With some custom properties in the [[Obsidian]] source, the ''updated'' date for the RSS entries now gets rendered correctly.

Tilman showed us Naive Weekly, the website of Kristoffer Tjalve (see below) and his project 'Internet Phone Book'. It reminded us a bit of the web addressbooks which were around some 25 years ago. Seems [https://www.web-adressbuch.de/ some of these are still going strong]. The site is HTTP only, no surprise here.

In the end we talked a bit about the new iOS 26 design and the pros and cons of Liquid Glass.
