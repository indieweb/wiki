Welcome, everyone!

* Getting photos on your website
** Jo has an Instagram-esque interface on her website: https://josprojects.com/
** https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/
* {{artlung}} has blogged several times in the last week, and set up the next Front End Study Hall https://events.indieweb.org/2024/05/front-end-study-hall-002-5oY7I2XFCyLV (next week! please RSVP if you'd like to attend! All are welcome!)
* IndieWeb events at https://events.indieweb.org
* Manny improved the accessibility of his site yay! [[accessibility]] 
** Popover API is now Baseline (supported across all major browsers): https://web.dev/blog/popover-api
* Mental health awareness month is May: https://www.mhanational.org/mental-health-month
** UK Mental health awareness week is coming up: https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week
* Semantic HTML exercise: write a CV / resume.

* Manual until it hurts: [[manual_until_it_hurts]]
* When you copy-paste something for the third time, you may want to make a more automatic way to do something.
* `iframe` is the most common way to embed a separate HTML page on the client-side, but one could also use an `object` tag to include an external piece of web content. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object ... iframes are essentially a refinement of frameset and frame (now deprecated https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset ) which was the way for an html page to include another web page. {{artlung}} cut his teeth doing wild things with frames, including frames which include the same page, creating an infinite loop which used to crash browsers.
* {{marksuth}} has revamped his site markup to be far cleaner and was able to remove Bootstrap entirely but retain essentially the same design - great job!

Sorry everyone, got to go!
