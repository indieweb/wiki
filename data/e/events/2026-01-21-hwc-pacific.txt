== Notes ==
* Welcome to Homebrew Website Club! We talk about personal websites and our agency over our own digital presences here!

=== Joe === 
** https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/power-of-the-powerless/ was cited by Canada's leader, Joe wants to put a copy of his speech at Davos ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTvFnC-oFGw )
** I created a special page on Smorgasborg for just the RSS/Atom feed patterns for some silos https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/feed-patterns/
** I am slightly more automated on https://indieweb.thisbot.day/ but probably will be semi-manual in some respects for a while (posts to [[Bluesky]] and [[Mastodon]] on Mondays the upcoming https://events.indieweb.org events
** This week created [[journal]] page to flesh out a bit the idea of "journal" and "journaling" - which had no page

=== Morgan demos animation change: <code>will-change</code> ===
* 2-3 min demo of web graphics changes:
* Story: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/will-change
* Removing "Will Change" from an animation

=== Donations? Causes? ===
How do people publish their donations?
* [[supporting]]
* [[donation]]
** gRegor's example from IWCSD https://gregorlove.com/causes/ which I forgot to complete and link to, thanks for the nudge
* {{t}}: 

=== Security, Uses, Setups, Packing, Gear ===
* Pages like /uses vs /colophon
* opsec (security vulnerability of sharing) and "uses" or "colophon?"

{{t}} has blogged packing lists of a few specific kinds:
* SXSW packing lists
* photos of what I packed on a trip, items laid out on a bed in a aesthetic arrangement
* race kits e.g. https://tantek.com/2020/073/t3/racekit-muc50 

Morgan: 1-2 minute show and tell of some new music gear, considered for a variation of /uses specific to music gear :
* https://www.morganwebdev.org/posts/original-layering-machine/
* Device is from Teenage Engineering https://teenage.engineering/products/ep-40

=== Post vs Page? ===
* editing an existing page can be more difficult
* a "now" page that one has to update manually can be a source of stress 

=== APPS!!! ===
Also, Morgans old website used to be a CSS phone: https://web.archive.org/web/20220520181335/https://www.morganwebdev.com/ with an app drawer style
* {{t}} has virtual "app page" designs on https://tantek.com/contact  -  https://tantek.com/pay

=== Using file modification for display ===
* Joe used to use flastmod -= https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_include.html#element.flastmod to display a last updated datetime for an html page. Ross used to but build processes for SSG's often make such a thing impossible

( An interesting article about Dates on Documents, that this discussion made me think of: https://infrequently.org/2025/08/names-and-dates-on-docs-every-time/

=== Fonts ===
* Simpler (older method?) System Font Stack: https://systemfontstack.com/
* Newer system font stacks (more stylish?):  https://modernfontstacks.com/
* I was reminded of this fun "keming" shirt: https://laughingsquid.com/keming-and-other-t-shirts-for-type-nerds/
