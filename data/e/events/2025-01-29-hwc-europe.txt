== Notes ==
* Time Zones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone
* Titles In Scotland: https://establishedtitles.com/
* Proper Pronuncation of Edinburgh "eden-BRUH"
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti
* English as a language of many
* The quirks, delights & accidents of mispellings
* How many words can refer to the exact same thing
* Cultural differences between folks who vlog and blog
* Indieweb culture vs surf culture: the balance between sharing and keeping it private. All communities grapple with the divide between these two
** Waves are a finite resource, and so more people added has an impact of ones own usage 
* Feeling intimidated is one of the biggest reasons why folks don't join new communities or learn new hobbies
* Study showing the proficiency levels of technology based on personal demographics: previously there was a correlation between low proficiency levels and lack of resources, and now the correlation is between low profiency levels and frequent usages of digital wallets
* The tension between convience and privacy, monetization and keeping things community-based
* Your interests can be as simple or as complex as you like, and time/interests are the biggest determining factors
* Technology metaphors as a teaching method for life and vice versa
** Teaching the Ruby programming language to kids through play: https://helloruby.substack.com/
* Learning styles are more preferences or comforts than actually proven as better for you to learn from: often the most effective way to learn is via engaging as many of your senses as possible at once
** Often the most important thing is making it interesting
* Learning tools, learning preferences, motivated learning all fascinating topics
* When building tools, one has to consider the audience: different demographics may as well speak different languages
* Everyone has their drink of choice and won't be told otherwise: and that metaphor applies to technology too
* What is programming like in different languages, given US English is the 'accepted default'?
** The pain of debugging for hours only to find you've spelled a programming concept in
