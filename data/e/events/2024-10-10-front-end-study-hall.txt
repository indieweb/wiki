== Notes ==
* Today's background: https://www.flickr.com/photos/artlung/144664168/ from 2006, {{artlung}}'s m,yspace layout which was based on the excellent article Hacking a more tasteful MySpace Layout http://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts 
* [[Front_End_Study_Hall]] <- idea list
* Music for Airports: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwYtllyt3Q
* topic - spoiler tag - sparked by https://matthewjamestaylor.com/custom-tags 
* James suggestion: how does the layout work on http://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts (the colour overlay on the image, the grid) -- what's the best way to make this with CSS grid?

* Glitch as a makerspace
* What is the modern equivalent of MySpace as a hook for web programming?
** [[Cohost]] (soon RIP) allowed custom CSS in posts leading to what they lovingly called "CSS Crimes." They gave a presentation at XOXO 2024 with some of those. Not sure if it was recorded.
