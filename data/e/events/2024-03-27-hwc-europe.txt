This one?? https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/01/webmentions-through-the-rss-feed/

I think it is this one: https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/03/interaction-on-the-web-my-addition-to-the-great-posts-by-alex-tracy-jo-and-bacardi55/ , but I am not 100% sure

* Webmention test suite: https://webmention.rocks/
* {{Jj}} has an interesting solution to be able to have webmentions for small short comments while still balancing out the longer posts - just strip out the shorter comment notes from the feed.
* Idea: RSS feed could be "cluttered" with everything, but the front page of your site could be the posts of which you are most proud, your longer blog posts, etc. {{alabut}} is particularly excited about this idea, since there's a split between friends that subscribe to his RSS feed vs direct website visitors for more commercial purposes.
