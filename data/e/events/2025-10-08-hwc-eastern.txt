Idea to discuss; Looking at my website for a minute, Office Hours idea
I have an RSS Feed! https://www.morganwebdev.org/index.xml
(but no button for it anymore... Im one of the baddies :P )

* Browsers removed the RSS Button and they should bring it back
** https://openrss.org/blog/browsers-should-bring-back-the-rss-button

* [[office_hours]]
* Calendly has been really useful for automatically scheduling events, skipping bottlenecks in organizing, particularly one on ones.
** alternate to Calendly is https://cal.com/

WHATS YOUR STACK:
* in James' abscence, I will say "waffles" -- gRegor
* {{alabut}}: [[Astro]]

BUILD PERFORMANCE: Not everyones favorite metric but mine :D
https://www.11ty.dev/docs/performance/#build-performance
(Note; Hugo fastest then, 11ty close)

Morgans evolution:
Silos->Hexo Blog (defunct? Actually it turns out its still going https://hexo.io/, my first SSG)->Hugo (Current)->Foot in the door with 11ty

Joe's site:
Static when it started, moved to Blogger.com to do blog posts, imported all those into WordPress in 2004, now there's more static/semidynamic content which creates rss feeds, consumes rss from youtube for example, all in custom PHP + Twig for templating and PHP Classes home-written and several composer based modules
* 10k+ distinct URLs WOAH! Thats rad

* Mark is Laravel, website is public on github
** Leaned away from static sites because of the amount of external data, plus easier to have search with a dynamic site
** Experience from using Laravel at work, it's highly opinionated and yet still flexible, can even go headless if needed
** Joe's looking at Laravel for search, Mark recommends Laravel Scout

Pierre:
* several VPS instances
* homecrafted static, 11ty, mysql
* back Go language https://deno.com ~ made to be a node alternative

Angelo:
** Python Python MVC framework
** deeply dynamic
** his editor uses the same templating system
** templates inside templates
