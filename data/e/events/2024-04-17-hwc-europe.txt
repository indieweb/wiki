== Notes ==
* {{marksuth}} this week updated his list lists, the vinyl, books (not yet shown), movies and beers: https://marksuth.dev/collections - just curates the posts, that are already posted, but not based on the post types - most data was imported from other sites

* IndieWeb Carnival: [[indieweb-carnival]] 
** h-feed that can be turned to RSS feed with the granary: [[indieweb-carnival/feed]]

* Front End Study Hall - an event next week: https://events.indieweb.org/2024/04/front-end-study-hall-FHS5M2AofkU4 April 24, 20 - {{artlung}} is organizing the first one and his blog post is https://artlung.com/blog/2024/04/15/front-end-study-hall/ - the intent is to learn CSS together - bring your questions, layouts giving you trouble, things you're interested to learn and we can study and learn to make good CSS and HTML together!

* {{alabut}} made a single page html/css tutorial called Half Naked CSS: https://alabut.com/projects/halfnaked/ (very early prototyping as of yesterday, feedback welcome!)

** https://www.laurasstories.live/ (personal website of an adventure journalist with a simple Bootstrap-style format, yet possibly still a little too advanced for most CSS tutorials)
 
* Derek Sivers' Tech Independence: https://sive.rs/ti (inspired Ros to go indie and can set up a server instead of Dropbox)

* Small Flex vs Grid CSS sample : https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/VwNEKOB

Zen overlaps with beginner's mind and indie maker mindset:
* {{toddpresta.com}}'s favorite Zen book: https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Mind-Beginners-50th-Anniversary/dp/1611808413
* {{alabut}}'s favorite Zen book by his bedside: https://happiness-beyond-thought.com/
* {{marksuth}} has a Zen garden Lego set: https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/tranquil-garden-10315

Old joke: How do programmers remodel a kitchen? They build a new one right next to the old one.

The group is noodling on the idea of "digital makers" as a nice introductory phrase that makes the indieweb more approachable and understandable, compared to terms like "coding".

It might be fun to review old web books to see how they hold up and fit with Tthe "what's old is new again" vibe of teaching HTML these days.
* {{marksuth}} showed his well-worn copies of:
** https://www.amazon.com/Bulletproof-Web-Design-flexibility-protecting/dp/0321509021
** https://www.amazon.com/Activators-Your-Website-Bill-Thompson/dp/034073650X
    
Fun website to teach kids to build websites: https://usborne.com/us/quicklinks/quicklink/build-your-own-website-for-beginners-us

* {{angelo}} is working on a travelogue about hikes up to Inspiration Point.
** Naz Hamid is a designer that does time-bound newsletters that he writes from the road while overlanding and road tripping, much like Craig Mod's walking tours of Japan.

* {{alabut}} is exploring the formats of vertical videos and stories
** https://alabut.com/drafts/neighborhoodrides/ (a test page with 3 vertical videos from a recent Instagram story, embedded into a simple scrolling blog post)
