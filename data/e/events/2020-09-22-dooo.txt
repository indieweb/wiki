== Notes ==

=== Demo of Reclaim Cloud services ===
* Google whitelisting domains might take a while.... But if you use Firefox, it can sometimes just make it less anxiety provoking. 
* Reclaim Cloud Community Forums: https://community.reclaimhosting.com/c/cloud/36
* [[Reclaim Hosting]]'s Github: github.com/reclaimhosting 
* Reclaim Cloudâ€™s mission is to make pretty advanced tools user-friendly for the educational community.

Has a marketplace with one click install for a variety of applications.- similar to what users might be familiar with in Installatron. Things like
* Azuracast - ds106 radio runs off of this
* Mattermost (open source Slack alternative)
* Node.js

* Allows the ability for one person to maintain (pay for) an account but give credentials to others to manage and make changes or hand over.
* Can I get on that plan where Tim manages and pays for my sites but I get to peek and see? :-) LOL
* Reclaim Hosting's GitHub account has the open source code for importing a variety of installers within Reclaim Cloud. These can be shared. 
* Visit env-2169314.us.reclaim.cloud to draw with the gang...
* Trial accounts are free for 14 days to try things out 
** SIgn up here: https://reclaim.cloud/signup/

* Feature Requests for application installers: https://community.reclaimhosting.com/c/cloud/cloud-features/50
* Pressbooks on shared hosting is missing the MathJax dependency. We were told that would take a separate server. Maybe you could host 1 MathJax server for all of your shared hosting participants that need it?

=== Questions ===
* Which applications are available within the cloud that aren't available on standard shared hosting? 
** Shared hosting apps: https://installatron.com/apps
** Reclaim Cloud Marketplace: https://reclaim.cloud/applications/ & https://docs.jelastic.com/marketplace/ 

* Pros/cons of cloud vs. shared? Cost comparisons?

* I think I understand docker... but could someone explain it using very small words?

* Is there a one click install for [[PressBooks]]?


=== Demos ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} photos pulled from Android Phone going via IFTTT.com to a webhook that sends data to a [[Micropub]] Endpoint on his website (WordPress with the Micropub plugin)

** {{macgenie}}
* [https://sunlit.io/ Sunlit] for [[micro.blog]] (3.0 version is out) is a [[micropub]] client for posting to any CMS with support for the Micropub spec.
