== Notes ==
=== Demo of Reclaim Cloud ===
[[User:Timowens.io|Tim Owens]] gave us a 30 minute demo/walkthrough of some of the capabilities of the Reclaim Cloud environment
* Google whitelisting domains might take a while.... But if you use Firefox, it can sometimes just make it less anxiety provoking. 
* Reclaim Cloud Community Forums: https://community.reclaimhosting.com/c/cloud/36
* [[Reclaim Hosting]]'s Github: github.com/reclaimhosting 
* Reclaim Cloudâ€™s mission is to make pretty advanced tools user-friendly for the educational community.

Has a marketplace with one click install for a variety of applications.- similar to what users might be familiar with in [[Installatron]]. Things like
* [[Azuracast]] for radio/audio - ds106 radio runs off of this
* [[Mattermost]] (open source [[Slack]]/chat alternative)
* [[Node.js]]

* Allows the ability for one person to maintain (pay for) an account but give credentials to others to manage and make changes or hand over.
* Can I get on that plan where Tim manages and pays for my sites but I get to peek and see? :-) LOL
* Reclaim Hosting's GitHub account has the open source code for importing a variety of installers within Reclaim Cloud. These can be shared. 
* Visit env-2169314.us.reclaim.cloud to draw with the gang...
* Trial accounts are free for 14 days to try things out 
** Sign up here: https://reclaim.cloud/signup/

* Feature Requests for application installers: https://community.reclaimhosting.com/c/cloud/cloud-features/50
* [[Pressbooks]] on shared hosting is missing the [[MathJax]] dependency. We were told that would take a separate server. Maybe you could host 1 MathJax server for all of your shared hosting participants that need it?


=== Questions ===
* Which applications are available within the cloud that aren't available on standard shared hosting? 
** Shared hosting apps: https://installatron.com/apps
** Reclaim Cloud Marketplace: https://reclaim.cloud/applications/ & https://docs.jelastic.com/marketplace/ 

* Pros/cons of cloud vs. shared? Cost comparisons?

* I think I understand [[docker]]... but could someone explain it using very small words?

* Is there a [[one click install]] for [[PressBooks]]?


=== Demos ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} photos pulled from Android Phone going via [[IFTTT]].com to a [[webhook]] that sends data to a [[Micropub]] Endpoint on his website (WordPress with the [[Micropub_for_WordPress|Micropub plugin]])
** More details about a part of the set up:  https://boffosocko.com/2020/01/21/using-ifttt-to-syndicate-pesos-content-from-social-services-to-wordpress-using-micropub/  

* {{macgenie}}
** [https://sunlit.io/ Sunlit] for [[micro.blog]] (3.0 version is out) is a [[micropub]] client for posting to any CMS with support for the Micropub spec.
** Yes, I am locked in https://jimgroom.micro.blog/
