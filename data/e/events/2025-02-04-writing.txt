== Topics ==

**Q: Setting Goals For One's Self / The Motive For Writing**

=== How do you write for a wider audience? ==

* Writing about non-technical topics
* Liking the idea of creating content, but not writing just to "put out more content"
* Wants to expand on the things I can create that might appeal to people
** Being more visible, approachable, building social skills, being more involved in the tech community.
** Not more of this: https://aggrippino.com/2025/02/the-menu-element/
* Writing HOWTOs involves having a clear brief; long-form personal writing has more freedom.
* Balancing the technical and the personal: can you add your own commentary? Experience?
* Finding how and where to relate to others through writing
* Writing is always conversation, regardless of how many or how few are involved
* Can you write an article from a different perspective?
* Writing for a different audience; for technical writing, write for someone who doesn't know how to code / have background in a given area.
** "Naming your invisible audiences to free yourself from unspoken obligations" by Maggie Appleton https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience/"
** Always useful to get readers who have different backgrounds / perspectives.
* Writing as learning different perspectives: find people to read your work before you put it in the world
** A writing group, a friend, family member, etc
** Tracy Durnell offered editing for blog posts: https://tracydurnell.com/2024/12/01/gift-to-the-indie-web-i-will-edit-your-blog-post/ Perhaps others could do the same? Or swap posts?

Random James note: Writing as play.
* Technical writing challenge that Joe has done before as part of a class: Write instructions for sitting on a chair.
** The aim of technical writing is to include every possible instructions the reader might need: assume nothing

* Google appears to have documentation for a course on technical writing. Here's a section on audience: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/audience

==== Roblox Game Design As Programming? ====

* Is Making a Roblox Game Considered Programming? (~ 320 words)
** https://aggrippino.com/2025/02/is-making-a-roblox-game-considered-programming/

=== How Do You Think About Audience? ===

** Posting on different platforms for different audiences (doesn't fit on your blog, it may fit elsewhere like Codepen).
** Posting to the void.
** The surprise of having someone reach out after enjoying  an old blog post you wrote.
** Writing something that I like; writing what we want to read.
** Not thinking too much about audience.
** Ties into the question of "what are you writing for?"
** Write to learn; you can try to publish (indie, traditional, share in communities).
** Submitting work to anthologies to learn, to discover like-hearted folks, community
*** Find people in communities of people who you want to reach (is it local? is it interest-based?) (Example: https://dimestories.org/, a writing community in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States
*** Local scenes: poetry, writing groups, workshops, bookstores, libraries, etc

=== How Do You Go About Co-Writing / Writing In A Group? ===

* Guest-star in others' blogs through doing artwork / graphics; a fun thing to do.
* "How can I contribute?" when writing with someone else.
* Compilation zines or collaborative fanzines (Tumblr is a great source for this)
* Collaboratiive creativity is a little fraught because it's like any relationship: all the good and the bad
** Key is to start with a positive feeling / a goal in mind; mutual interest.
* Collaboritive comics: adapting written works to the visual format
* What does it mean to collaborate on a work?
* Collaborative creation ideas:
** Running surveys/asking a question and collecting the responses
** Tagging people in 'challenges' or topics you write about
** Passing ideas back and forth across an idea of common interest
** https://blog.avas.space/your-internet/ -- an informal invitation to collaborate
** Ellipho: haikus, comic, words, writing, etc
** IndieWeb Carnivals: [[IndieWeb_Carnival]] 
*** This month: https://artlung.com/affirmations-ic/ (February "Affirmations")
**** https://www.fractalkitty.com/math-ffirmations/
*** Also worth looking at January 2025's Carnival https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-roundup-2025
*** Carnivals invite creativity, collaboration, help people build confidence (seeing others write), low barrier to entry.
*** List of carnivals: [[blog_carnival]]
** You can start your own carnival/community event! If something doesn't exist, create it for yourself
**** Examples: https://mathober.com and https://www.creativemornings.com/
**** Sometimes people don't join your thing, but that's okay! You can try again with a new idea, or keep persisting. You never know where things will leave.
**** There are so many communities for all sorts of collaborative making: find your people!
* "ripples" from writing
* Collaborative making is the perfect way to grow your confidence and people skills

== Is there a convention for collaborating? ==

* Email signatures to facilitate contribution to things
** Is there a slash page convention for this?
** /make-together
** /create-together
** /worktogetherwithme
** /work-together
** /collaborations
** /create
** /collaborative-cohesion
*** What portmanteaus could we use?
**** /collabivity
