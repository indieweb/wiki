Bridgy Fed https://fed.brid.gy/
* {{gRegor}} has been using this pretty reliably the last 6-8 months, works well for me since I'm able to send webmentions already, which triggers federating one of my posts

{{artlung}} has found https://ifttt.com/instagram integrations on IFTTT useful - I have automations that pull content from my Ig account to my wordpress site as posts, and also to a flickr account. There are half-way measures to pull in accounts to a cloud storage or other places

{{artlung}} artlung.com, been digging up https://lab.artlung.com/, removed Google Ads which were highly obnoxious. I posted my page on server side maps the other day in the chat and the ads took over. Now it's a bit better. https://lab.artlung.com/server-side-image-map/ ... post about the lab: Deprecations and Exhumations https://artlung.com/blog/2024/01/17/dee-and-eee/
