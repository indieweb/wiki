* Welcome to HWC!
* A blog post James saw recently and enjoyed: https://alexwlchan.net/2025/learning-how-to-make-websites/
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSVPkuplVRY --- PC that makes coffee
* "sonification"

* What we're making
** Tantek not making anything new on his site recently, struggling with PHP8 problems
*** https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.incompatible.php
** James is building a site to view rainfall data in Scotland year-over-year
** Cool portfolio site with sound: https://omegacentauri.jp/
** https://eva.town/ has a piano on it!
** Manny is building with the Share API in the browser.
** https://mandarismoore.com/2025/05/27/share-the-love.html
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API
** Turning on SSL on a website and enabling dynamic DNS
*** https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/glossary/dynamic-dns/
** Designing a KanBan board in HTML/CSS
*** Use is to keep all task management within a repository
*** Implemented with CSS grid; change a class name to move the column of a task.

* Accessible code snippets are hard
* The Good Internet Magazine is live! https://goodinternetmagazine.com/

* Code snippet design
** Anchor links to line numbers
** Could a code snippet have sidenotes (or are comments enough)?
*** Sidenotes may be ideal for longer comments
** Screen size -- how much space do you have?

* {{alabut}} recently had a "worlds colliding" moment when a cyclist from Germany DMed on Instagram about seeing Al's blog on the Indieweb
** His name is Joshua Meissner and his personal site has beautiful photography and links to his writing: https://joshuameissner.de/
** His next goal is to build out his own blog more and display routes. Publishing maps on your personal website is a land mine, some good resources to get an overview of the current state of things is on the wiki: [[maps]]
** I found Joshua through his excellent article on bikepacking.com, a website I've often referenced as an example of a small business and website run with Indieweb principles: https://bikepacking.com/stories/slower/

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow
** Can be used to fill space in columns of grid items

* Unfinished Projects Release Forms booklet
** https://shop.weirdsideprojects.com/product/unfinished-projects-forms

* What are the potential uses for floats in 2025?
** As an aside paragraph or two, or a mini-note that has its own heading within a blog post.
** A pull quote, in the print magazine-style layout.
** Example of float on https://tantek.com/2025/127/b1/running-for-w3c-advisory-board-ab-election; the grey box at the top of the page.
** {{mandaris}} - Using floating for images https://mandarismoore.com/2025/03/02/your-friendly-neighborhood-spiderman.html
** A bad use of floats: For a two-column layout. Grid is recommended today.
** {{mandaris}} - Multicolum list of categories https://mandarismoore.com/2025/03/02/your-friendly-neighborhood-spiderman.html
