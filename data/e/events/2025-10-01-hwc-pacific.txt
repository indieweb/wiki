Connecting to IndieWeb chat:
* IRC
** A "bouncer" helps maintain a persistent connection to IRC
*** Popular choices: znc, soju
*** https://thelounge.chat/ is a web-based option
*** Bouncer doesn't need to be accessible, just persistently connected and visible to your client
** Ross uses Heisenbridge to bridge IRC to Matrix: https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge
* Slack
* Discord

Backups discussion - Skepticism about relying on Time Machine backups, considering alternatives
* https://freefilesync.org/
* https://github.com/restic/restic
* https://www.borgbackup.org/ : similar to Restic.  Self-hosted and/or managed.
* 3-2-1 backup rule: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#3-2-1_Backup_Rule
* TEST YOUR BACKUPS!

Self-hosting:
* Docker vs. not-Docker
** Ross uses NixOS.  Great, but heavy learning curve.
** You probably don't need Docker for a static site.
*** Great for isolation.  But: what are you doing besides exposing a directory?
** Ross uses NixOS.  Great, but heavy learning curve.
* Web server
** Apache
** Nginx
** Caddy
*** Ross's choice.  Makes easy things easy.  Doesn't preclude hard.
* Be prepared to deploy anti-scraping tech to keep your site up, regardless of how you feel about AI!
** {{lifeofpablo}} Docker compose  - https://github.com/pmoralesgarcia/pabsnet/blob/main/docker-compose.yml

I tried to paste an image into this etherpad to try it out and its acting a bit buggy for me- hope not for everyone else!
But yeah I just set up Backblaze! √√√
