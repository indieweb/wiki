== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!
* How we got started in the IndieWeb community
** micro.blog as an entry point, then you can always build your own site if/when you want
** "Maybe if I could add this one other thing..."
** gRegor found early experiments with Webmentions interesting, started implementing, then came to IWC Portland 2014
*** https://gregorlove.com/2014/02/powered-by-indieweb/ and I just added the #Indieweb tag to this post almost 12 years later :D
** James saw #IndieWeb posted by Chris Aldrich at some point, joined chat, and loved the community
** Joe also saw #IndieWeb at some point, went to an XOXO meetup, gRegor reached out at some point
** Thomas' first mention of IndieWeb was in 2014 on his website; knew several people in the community.
*** Thomas' blog is now 25 years old! -- a testament to the longevity possible with personal websites
**** Thomas' first mention of IndieWeb from March 2014 - https://vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=2030
*** First chat still in the archives: https://chat.indieweb.org/2015-02-26/1424992894728000
** Paul: wanted to post on the internet; Mastodon, Fediverse, etc. are confusing; remembered the IndieWeb as starting on your own site, then add things later.
* Idea: Your personal #IndieWeb timeline
* IndieWeb advice
** Follow your curiosities
** You don't have to do everything all at once
** Don't compare your site to others'
* Account deletion
** James' question: how would you feel if a service reached out to you to ask if you want to close your account if you haven't signed in for a few months?
** pbwiki makes it easy for you to keep a wiki alive in their software; there is a link you can click on that marks a wiki as active for 11 months. You don't need to be authenticated -- so you can keep others' wikis alive if they haven't deleted it. Exemplar for maintaining multi-author works.

Carousels with CSS

* Forgiving designs
** Forgiving February -- a time to renew your resolutions / goals
** [[February:]] add any "challenges" or similar monthly things!

* No socials January - don't post in January
** https://tantek.com/2026/001/t1/no-socials-january
*** caveats: no *public* posts, not a comment on consumption habits
** could do an update, make explicit:
*** no *public* posts, non-public posts ok (e.g. friends-only Strava, Swarm)
**** exception: direct income related use of social media, e.g. entertainers/comedians needing to post about their shows. If you need to post on social media to support your income, this does not apply to you.
*** adjust your reading/consumption as you see fit

** {{gRegor}}: I just watched a Tessa Violet video about her limiting "screens" (largely entertainment that isn't social) for the month, some good messages in there, especially about being kind to yourself: https://youtu.be/-FU23jSEt6g
*** big fan of Tessa, looking forward to watching this - Joe

** Other videos about non online periods
*** Taylor Lorenz talks with Ian Anderson about a researchers at the California Institute of Technology about the framing we need to have about stopping the bad habit of using social media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-0z0j0QvPI)
**** +1, this was a really good one -- gRegor
*** Mel Mitchell-Jackson talk about doing a "scroll fast" trying to recontext the way they use their phone and keep having social connexions without social media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2ZKoClwKSY)
** Also for android users a change you can do to controll more what you are looking at you can use Olaucher, a launcher that converts your apps icons on only text (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher&hl=es&pli=1)

* Preparing for the Creator Economy Apocalypse (with Chris Gethard) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2uZ6C8xhGI
** talks about creators owning their own relationship with their fans/customers/listeners/readers
** talks about feeling a painful grind of feeling *forced* to post on a regular basis for their livlihood

* What would a "build your first website" challenge in January look like?
** see: [[newwwyear]]
** Nice!
* How can we help people take ownership of their identity?

* You can still be social without social media.

* Kind of related to the limits of interaction and networking: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number
Having random people in your feed kind of adds cognitive load and exceeds Dunbars number. One theory for why its so bad.
** Helpful to consider in designing social software.
** https://www.danah.org/ has done related work ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danah_boyd

** "suggested posts" = loss of agency over what you see.

* Re: the idea of limiting number of followers/etc: [[Monogram]]

* Incentives don't really exist for platform vendors to minimise users' time on social networks.
* How can software encourage you to take a breath?
* You don't have to give a reason to unsubscribe from something.

* We are used to reminders for everything with technology.
* It is good that we encourage people to build behaviours around positive actions in software (i.e. unfollow things you are no longer interested in) rather than relying on software to do all the work.

* Some tools in the early days of Twitter were built to help you unfollow people whose content you haven't read / interacted with often.
