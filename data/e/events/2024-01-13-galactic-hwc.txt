* people surf all year all over the world wherever waves break. if you want to learn check out the series Weird Waves from Vans and Dylan Graves on YouTube:. You could start with the one on Great Lakes surfers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DmoQ-ziT38 
* https://jamesg.blog/2024/01/12/information-coding/ - Club Penguin theme
* Al just launched his RSS feed in advance of our event - please subscribe! https://alabut.com/rss.xml (thank you {{capjamesg}} for the autodiscovery tip and Feedly debugging) 
** {{artlung}} was able to subscribe and I see 14 entries and they look good (oh whew, thank you Joe!)
* Working on the next iteration of improving the look of Never Mind The Bollocks in CSS https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/qBvaePM {{artlung}} - and I managed to rework it and add a resized up version that looks good. it uses CSS vars to make the individually distressed letters work

* Related to committees that lose sight of pragmatic solutions is a famous speech by programming pioneer Niklaus Wirth (who sadly just passed away at age 89) before creating the Pascal programming language: https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/A29/P32.HTM
* Also related context and more links from John Gruber: https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/11/niklaus-wirth-rip
* Post types: posts vs. notes
* Should you have a separate feed for notes, likes, etc.?
* Professional vs. personal websites
* federating our websites, POSSE-ing in from Mastodon / other social media -- perspective of meeting readers where they are and letting people consume in the place / way they want
* read-only feed readers vs the new breed of social readers (positive = two-way interactive, cons = might be complicated to set up, can be overwhelming to see an endless stream of a single feed of things without read/unread states)
** more potential / appeal when private posts become easier to do and more common
** {{petermolnar}} has written a little about accessing feeds and landing on email: https://petermolnar.net/article/turn-your-mailbox-into-an-archieving-rss-reader/
** challenge: IndieWeb moved towards a single feed for people on the presumption that social readers would allow intelligent user control to filter out only the parts they want to read, but aren't quite there yet
** distinguishing: collapsing all of a single person's content into a single feed, and collapsing all the people you follow into a single feed (a la classic social media feed)
* https://xoxo.zone/@fraying/111734924727494794  -- discussion re: federating WordPress comments
* sidenotes 
** https://gwern.net/sidenote -- compares implementations and pros & cons
** {{tracydurnell}} has CSS-only sidenotes -- used https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/sidenotes-without-js with <aside>
* two distinct types of algorithm we're discussing: 1) filter from a large pool and surface recommendations of people / posts you aren't following 2) filter within your own pool of feeds (especially with a large number of feeds, or feeds with high volume mixed with low volume feeds)
** NewsBlur -- train your feed reader

* {{capjamesg}}  pointed out that reading my website https://artlung.com/ with a microformats-based reader (rather than RSS) showed entries with just a tiny bit of metadata - thanks James for the heads up! https://artlung.com/blog/2024/01/13/galactic-notes-from-the-indieweb/ - and I added to this post to include notes about the CSS work I've done on the album cover which has been so gratifying to work on
* what are the possible emotional repercussions when a blog post finds an audience that you didn't necessarily intend?
