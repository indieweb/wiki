{{artlung}} added theming on https://lab.artlung.com/ that persists for you the reader - all the code is open source on github if you're curious as to how it works https://github.com/artlung/lab.artlung.com (look at the 2025.scss and 2025.js files in particular)

{{paotsaq was wondering whether it relied on js â€” guess I have the answer ðŸ˜„. thanks for the meeting! great stuff.}}
