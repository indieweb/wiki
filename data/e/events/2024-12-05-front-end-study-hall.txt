* Joe's background today is from [https://lab.artlung.com/w3c-with-and-without-css/ from 2001] and showcases how powerful CSS was in 2001, and also how well good markup absent CSS still renders readably and legibly

=== Elsewise ===
* {{benji}}: had to run to a meeting. ''(Thanks for joining Benji! - {{artlung}})''
** {{benji}} added really cool animated decorations https://www.benji.dog/articles/december-adventure-2024/ inspired by today!

* Terrific inspiring talk about better tech in the browser from Config 2024: Design engineering
** From design to engineer (Jhey Tompkins, Vercel) | Figma
*** Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKm4JcT4U4

* {{artlung}} added theming on https://lab.artlung.com/ that persists for you the reader - all the code is open source on github if you're curious as to how it works https://github.com/artlung/lab.artlung.com (look at the <code>2025.scss</code> and <code>2025.js</code> files in particular)
** 
** {{paotsaq}} was wondering whether it relied on js — guess I have the answer 😄. thanks for the meeting! great stuff.
* * {{artlung}} recently was watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn3vYS_msc0 which mentioned how the browser development teams do ask for bug reports, comments. Comment: ''If we have concerns as authors on the web we ought to claim our voice and be heard when we see problems or features we wish worked differently.''
