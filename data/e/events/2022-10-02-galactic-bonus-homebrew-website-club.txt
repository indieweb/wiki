== Notes ==
* Going around to discuss what we have been doing on our websites in the last few weeks
* https://ggirelli.info/: switched from third-party requests to self-hosting (or changing service)
* Navigation bars - hamburgers
** Don't use details/summary because it has poor screenreader support
** JS is worth using

Use of emojis probably did more for the Unicode support than anything else. Because the people in the west expected it to just work.
