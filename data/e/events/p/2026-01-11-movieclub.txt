* Icebreakers:
** Matt: red vines all the way, will fight Twizzler fans all the way
** Joe: hot dog w/ mustard and max nacho jalapeños 
** Al and Gregor like black licorice
** TIL that you can die from eating black licorice
** Gregor loves Woopers; Matt loves Malteezers
** Reilly likes kettle potato chips
* When do you like to watch movies?
** Joe used to love early morning movies
** Might be a West Coast thing? Or for big blockbusters that will run as many showings as possible.
** Al used to love the cheap Tuesday movies; Matt said it was a UK thing to go on Wednesdays, Gregor said it's an AMC thing too.

=== Ghost World ===
* Matt's take
** Why'd you pick this? "I watch this movie a lot, as well as Short Circuit 2"
** Goes all the way back to having taped it off the TV ~ ITV https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)
** Sees it 15 times a year for many years in a row
** Initially bought a Blu-Ray player just to watch this movie
*** Joe Bob Briggs on physical media and censorship https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWAX64pNDyg
** Is the movie different every time for you, or is it like comfort food where you have it memorized?
** Themes that resonate with him: 2000's takes him back to a specific time. E.g. Windows CE, that one specific phone handset.
** Reminds me of the meme of Seinfeld plots that would be ruined by cellphones
** No computers, a bit more timeless, just like the comic book.
** The comic book has a more expansive plot, the girls are just one part of it
	
* Joe
** read the comic book many years ago
** the urban sprawl feels very LA, even though the filmmakers tried to make it "anytown"
** the movie didn't hire a lot of extras to make it feel empty, but the sex shop it also has the school principal
** reminds him of other movies made from comics like Crumb and American Splendor
** the tension between friends as they grow apart
*** Related films for Joe
**** Crumb (Zwigoff's prior film, documentary) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumb_(film)
*** American Splendor (also comics adjacent) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Splendor_(film)
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Clowes - continies to write graphic novels and do illustrations
** Lloyd Llewellen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Llewellyn was the first time I encountered Daniel Clowes' work on shelves in comic book stores
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Soda OK Soda 1993-1995

* Gregor
** The comedy is tone perfect for me, keeps coming back to it over the lines
** "This is so bad it's gone past bad and back to good again."
** Loves the open-ended melancholy ending.
	
* Al
** Reminds me of Trainspotting 2 (main character becomes an artist documenting the events throughout the movie)
** Makes me want to watch Last Black Man In San Francisco because of a cameo by Thora Burch
...

* T
** was confusing Ghost World with other movies that end in "...World" like Cool World. Found this: https://www.listchallenges.com/movies-with-world-in-the-title
** Getting friends to watch is hard because of the title
** Exact opposite of straightforward titles like Snakes On A Plane or Sharknado
*** The original Snakes on a Plane blog post: https://hucksblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/snakes-on-motherfucking-plane.html
*** "Much of the initial publicity came from a blog entry made by screenwriter Josh Friedman, who had been offered a chance to work on the script." - Wikipedia
** Were opaque names a 90's and early 2000's trend?

* Joe:
 ** Worth pointing out that the author Daniel Clowes has done a lot of great work since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Clowes

=== Alien ===
* Al
** Alien has become a favorite of his, he blogged about it: https://alabut.com/writing/alien1979/
** Blade Runner is also a favorite
* Alien starts slow, takes time to establish seting, naturalistic acting, matter-of-fact
* Fun fact - William Gibson wrote a treatment of Alien 3 that got turned into a comic book
** https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/William_Gibson%27s_Alien_3_(comic)
* Gibson is on Bluesky and posts a lot
** https://bsky.app/profile/greatdismal.bsky.social
* Connection to Jodorowsky's Dune

* Reilly
** Loves it along with partner who has film and music degrees
** Bela Bartok ripoff / cue (homage to the hallway scenes in The Shining? ripoff?)
*** Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta, movement III
** "The ghosts hate when you do this"
** (scene with Sigourney Weaver in Ghostbusters)

* Joe
** Showed book of art from Ron Cobb
** Gritty space realism pioneered by Star Wars
** https://semioticstandard.org/
* Ron Cobb https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Cobb
* Gregor's Zoom background of the Nostromo: https://wallpapercave.com/w/wp9151704
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky%27s_Dune (one of {{artlung}}'s top 4 https://artlung.com/top4/ )
* Ridley Scott could draw - drew 
** https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Alien-(1979)#tab=box-office
** "The prequels robbed the magic by over-explaining."

* Alien: Earth is a return to form in many ways
* Will the worlds of Blade Runner and Alien get merged? Or Predator? Writers from Predator Badlands are collaborating.
* Predator Badlands also might have touches between the worlds
* Soldier (1998) is the unofficial sequel to Blade Runner https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_(1998_American_film)
* The globe-spanning corporations in Alien: Earth are very interesting backstories to the original Alien without over-explaining it.
* Neuromancer: does the United States even exist in the future?
* Gibson got the idea from Royal Shell Company doing business with both Allies and Axis powers

* Alien design inspired by insects, truly alien creature https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger

* Roger Ebert revisited Alien in 2003: https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-alien-1979
* Gibson's views on multinationals as replacing the power of national polities are in https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/William_Gibson_Interview/
** Prey https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(2022_film)
*** Same filmmaker as Predador Badlands https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Trachtenberg

* Other 70s low-fi indie SF with work-a-day settings
** Dark Star https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Star_%28film%29%20 (a comedy)
** Silent Running https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running

* The ending:
** Gregor: why does the Alien take it's time in the shuttle?
** Al: why is it killing at all? Is it to feed, reproduce, threats?
** Reilly: the unpredictability is the truly scary aspect.
** Tantek: the TV series explains the biology of extraterrestrials a bit more
** Joe: the original movie tried to hide and obscure the humanity aspect of it as much possible.
* Performer of Alien was 6foot 10 inches tall https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolaji_Badejo

* Reilly
** The sound design helps obscure the reality of what's going on.
** Massive wall of sound on the planet exteriors, alternating with jarring silence in the interiors
** Then the two sounds merge together when the crew is loading up the coolant and Ripley is working on the shuttle, which creates an acceleration effect as the action ratchets up

* Al
** Saul Bass designed the logo reveal
** the UI also inspires me because of the simple terminal-like simplicity of it.
** creating that kind of interface today is fun because of how blindingly fast and snappy it is with modern bandwidth and GPUs

* {{t}}
** Cassette Futurism! see illustrative blog post: https://martin-fieber.de/blog/cassette-futurism/
** has collected materials as part of his plan to create a Wikipedia page on Cassette Futurism (previous page on Cassette futurism was deleted) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tantek#Cassette_Futurism
** example from his site: https://tantek.com/pictures/20021220_02002020020.JPG
** context: 
*** LED design also inspired by pure-CSS stopwatch. https://lab.artlung.com/css-stopwatch/
** context: https://tantek.com/log/2002/12.html
** teleprinter sound whenever lists of things appear on screen

* Massive amount of love for car dashboards that use physical interfaces, especially the brands that are bringing them back away from an all-screens interface. The amount of toggles and switches in Alien are all very intentional - the sets were built from WW2 scrapyard airplane equipment. Supposedly the computer interfaces and piloting equipment were all real, requiring a lot of actor training.
** E.g. mid-1980s era: Nissan 300ZX: https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1gv4n7w/nothing_beats_the_interior_dashboard_of_a_1985/

Very minimal info on a shareable link: https://libre.fm/user/mattl/scrobble/1767556934

* {{artlung}} needs to drop too! Fun talk!
