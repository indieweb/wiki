The IndieWeb community has built amazing things in 2015, come by to see our "Best of 2015" demos, and show us what are the best things you did on your own site in 2015!

Have you made a 2016-01-01 launch commitment? There's still time! 

Add yours: [[2016-01-01-commitments]]

Open floor for questions.

17:30-18:30 '''Quiet writing hour''' before the meetup. Come on by to blog or do other writing quietly.

'''Homebrew Website Club Meetup''': Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy? If so, come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends that want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project... 

See the [http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter Homebrew Website Club Newsletter Volume 1 Issue 1] for a description of the first meeting.
