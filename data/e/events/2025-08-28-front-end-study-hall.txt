== And so, Blogging ==
* '''Q: How does one find good blogs to read? Or find good blog posts about CSS in particular?'''
** CSS blogs: https://rs.sjoy.lol/
** adding "blog" at the end of a search query to see if you can find personal blogs (i.e. "clip-path css blog")
** https://cssday.nl/speakers.html list may include people who blog about CSS
** Discovering blogs by looking for the inspirations of people whose websites you enjoy (e.g. blogrolls like James' blogroll at https://jamesg.blog/wander )

=== Searching the independent web? ===
* Google with a search for "css blog" does passable but very much overloaded result: large ai summary, many videos
* Kagi "small web": https://kagi.com/smallweb does better (does not require paid account)
** Has a search feature!
* https://marginalia-search.com indexes lots of personal websites
* https://kagi.com/smallweb/?search=css
** List of blogs indexed @ https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb#small-web
** "No results found for "taylor swift""
* who worked with whom? like looking at the musicians who influenced musicians you liked
** https://www.music-map.com/taylor+swift
** https://www.chosic.com/playlist-generator/
* Nikolai Nolan - (the person cited on the Bloggies link above) https://sites.grenadine.co/sites/tsubasacon/ar/person/217
** Nikolai sitting next to Eric Meyer - https://www.flickr.com/photos/evaporated/6757590/in/faves-34793798@N00/

== Discussion: CSS Nesting vs SASS ==

* https://caniuse.com/css-nesting
** If an older browser encounters nested CSS, how will the web page look?
** Library computers may have browsers a few years out of date
** Know your audience, a closed audience can more reliably use modern features like CSS nesting
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports

* When using new features: do all parts of your stack understand it?
** James has observed VS Code's CSS syntax highlighter doesn't understand nesting
** Would syntax highlighters understand nested CSS?
** Often SASS and Nested syntax are identical, though SASS can also do things like loops currently not available

* A <code>~</code> (tilde) selector discussion - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Subsequent-sibling_combinator

== Question: How would I say a CSS selector in English? ==
=== SelectOracle! (memory lane) ===

* https://brajeshwar.com/2003/selectoracle-css-3/
** https://www.wired.com/2006/06/translate-css-to-human-speak/
** https://web.archive.org/web/20100106152244/http://gallery.theopalgroup.com/selectoracle/

* '''[https://kittygiraudel.github.io/selectors-explained/ CSS Selectors Explained]'''
** Currently does not appear to support <code>:has()</code> but is otherwise excellent!
** The challenge of speaking complex selectors allowed improves understanding

*** It would be cool for IDEs to have a hover effect that lets you see a CSS selector in plain English
* Ampersand selector: https://frontendmasters.com/blog/three-approaches-to-the-ampersand-selector-in-css/

* https://bettercss.guide/lesson/3-naming
** What makes for a good name?
** Object oriented CSS
** Semantic naming mental frameworks

* <code>&</code> nesting selector
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector

* Nice publication to check out https://goodinternetmagazine.com/
* Go to https://shkspr.mobi and select “Drunk” theme

== HTML short syntaxes ?! ==
* Slim? Pug?
* https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/OPVqzKJ uses Pug and loops to write CSS
** Daunting to many, but can be very useful!

== Elsewise ==

* '''Q:''' ''Eric, what font do you use for body copy on [https://meywerweb.com/ MeyerWeb]
** '''A:''' Georgia
** Georgia comes from Microsoft in 1993, and was part of the first free core web fonts set in 1996
*** Is Georgia always Georgia? (mobile devices such as Android can treat css font-family request for Georgia as another serif)
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)
* https://modernfontstacks.com/

* https://2001.bloggi.es/ uses Geogia as the first font in the list in the <code>&lt;font face&gt;</code> list (and so we end this meeting right where we started it with the 2001 Bloggies
