'''<dfn>[https://extend-domains.ecampusontario.ca/camp/ Domains Camp]</dfn>''' is a series starting July 10, 2018 and is open to anyone who wants to learn more about what is possible with an internet domain and web-hosting package. 

Our instructions will be tailored to the platform offered by our provider, [[Reclaim Hosting]], but could be used by anyone with a [[web_hosting|host]] that uses [[cpanel]] as the interface.

We will be holding most of our camp discussion in the Reclaim Hosting Community for [https://community.reclaimhosting.com/c/newbies Newbies Corner].
