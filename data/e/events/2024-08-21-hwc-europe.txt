Mark was eaten by the Windows XP. Sort of like in this story: https://archiveofourown.org/works/24073393 (I wonder if we need to send a rescue squad?) and how he is showing the people's pages in the Internet Explorer installed there. The sites without the HTTP support and with only HTTPS support do not work at all. Most the the sites tried did not work. Some did.

Novel about a person being trapped in the work Slack channel: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671445/several-people-are-typing-by-calvin-kasulke/ - James says it is a very good book

Ruby HTML tag can be used for any case, when you want a smaller text on top of the other text. It can be used for the additional explanation. I use it a small number of times in my writting, but I see it a lot of times in the Japanese sites. Their play on the meanings can be quite funny some times.
