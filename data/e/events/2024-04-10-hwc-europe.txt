== Notes ==
* Nostalgia for 90s computerdom and books
** James' Note to Self: Distribute his website on floppy disks.
* Sara Joy recently went to the trouble to install Word 97 https://front-end.social/@sarajw/112218176408848931 "Do I want to try and install Word 97 just to prove to myself there really was an HTML editor built into it?
I swear that's how I learned HTML. I think for my personal history I need to know. And take some decent screenshots..."
* What do people put on their wandering/blogroll/bookmarks sites? To find the new sites, we would to have StumbleUpon or the Yahoo directory. There were books with the index of movies with very short descriptions, but there were 1.000.000 of them. Maybe we need the IndieWeb directory. Or maybe we need to have more a long list? But how to not make it boring? If you can not go through it in the day, and you lose trackl, then the page can become boring? The rings have a similar role...
* {{capjamesg}} pointed out the random button on the {{artlung}} blogroll https://artlung.com/blogroll/ was broken. Typo introduced sometime in the past week. Bug fixed! 
* {{artlung}} has a plan to decide to set a date for an IndieWeb popup focused on a frontend HTML+CSS clinic/study hall/learning session {{sarajaksa}} reminded him to choose a time that works for him.
* old search engines

* New webring for people who appreciate Floppy Disks! by {{benji}}: https://1.44mb.club/

* A diversion, {{artlung}} once did data conversion by asking for help on Usenet and mailing off my disks to a person who mailed me back Windows-formatted files. https://www.usenetarchives.com/view.php?id=comp.sys.amiga.marketplace&mid=PDRtcG83ZCRlbm5AbmV3c2JmMDIubmV3cy5hb2wuY29tPg "08/05/1996 / I am interested in transferring files (text and graphics) from my Amiga 1000 (wb1.3) to mac formatted floppys (or even ibm format floppy) or mac zip drive or even cd-rom. / Is there anyone who does this or knows who might be able to do this service?" (back in the days of floppies) - and these were the resulting photos I got mailed back after a fellow in Canada and I corresponded via email. https://www.flickr.com/photos/artlung/albums/586293

A webmention haiku:
    Send a webmention.
    Wait! social likes included,
    destroyed attention.
James: I love it!
