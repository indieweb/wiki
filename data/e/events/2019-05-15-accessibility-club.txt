<span class="p-summary">We’re now bringing the Accessibility Club to Düsseldorf for the first time. The meetup will use a BarCamp-like format, which means that we don't have a predefined schedule, invited speakers or conference-like talks. The Accessibility Club wants to give you the chance to get some real-world experience with assistive technology, deepen your knowledge about web accessibility and get you in touch with like-minded webworkers. The goal is to enable you to make accessibility a natural part of your daily work and mindset.</span>
