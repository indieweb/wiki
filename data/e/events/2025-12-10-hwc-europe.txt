James, you can style the text in the ruby tag with CSS the same as any other HTML element. If you want the bigger emojies above your words, simply change font-size on the rt tag. They don't need to be small. 
** Thank you!
** The only thing I didn't manage to make it work with CSS until now was the wrapping of text in the way I want. Other things I tried generally work.
