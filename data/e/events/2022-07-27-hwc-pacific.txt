== Topics ==
* home website publishes microformats that neighboring houses can consume
** bird bath/feeder seed/nectar levels/refill to prioritize feeding accordingly
** native plants to eg. make sure that native animal species are satisfied in the greater ecosystem
** lost dog notice
* the state of plain HTTP (non-TLS)

* Say hello to "iwstats" (IndieWeb Statistics): a very simple statistics tool for the IndieWeb, because I had a bit of an itch about what was out there (and I needed a set of real life examples to run through my various parsers to see what breaks them).

* Some initial output, based on a limited sampling of +/-2000 websites, non-significant (<1%) results omitted:

** 25% have an authorization endpoint (27% of which via indieauth.com, 1% via micro.blog)
** 3% support indieauth-metadata (90% of which via wordpress plugin)
** 24% have a token endpoint (24% of which via indieauth.com; 18% via wordpress plugin)
** <1% have a ticket endpoint (4 implementations)
** 28% have a webmention endpoint (30% of which via webmention.io; 4% via micro.blog)
** 20% have a micropub endpoint (6% of which via micro.blog)
** 6% have a microsub endpoint (61% via aperture.p3k.io; 21 via micro.blog)
** 13 have a hubs endpoint (88% of which via superfeedr.com)

* Miscellaneous fun:
** 12% have X-Clacks-Overhead (2% use something other than the default GNU Terry Pratchett)

* Feeds?
** 81% have a feed (62% offer RSS; 24% json-feed;  12% ATOM; <1% jf2feed)
** how many have h-feed?

* TOR?
** <1% expose their onion address

* 772 homepages have a h-card, and contains:
** h-card.Adr (6% cohort)
** h-card.Birthday (1% cohort)
** h-card.Email (30% cohort)
** h-card.GenderIdentity (1% cohort)
** h-card.IPA (<1% cohort)
** h-card.JobTitle (4% cohort)
** h-card.Language (<1% cohort)
** h-card.Pronoun (1% cohort)
** h-card.Pronoun_n/o/p (<1% cohort)
** h-card.UID (15% cohort)
** h-card.URL (81% cohort)

** h-card.Name (91% cohort)
** h-card.Nickname (7% cohort)
** h-card.GivenName (6% cohort)
** h-card.FamilyName (5% cohort)

* toolbox.imoxia.com - especially fetcher and profile

* also look at https://developers.google.com/caja which is another deprecated project that parses CSS and HTML for safety

Maybe an iframe with a srcdoc="..." is best; it wouldn't inherit parent styles so all: revert wouldn't be necessary

Kevin wrote about allowing iframe srcdocs in e-* elements https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing-issues#e-_parsing_iframe_srcdoc, but the proposal was not followed b/c of lack of real-world examples. Now I want to allow h-* iframe srcdocs in mf parsers...I wonder if they'll allow it

Here is a test whostyle in an iframe: https://jacobhall.net/whostyle-iframe-test.html
