== Notes ==
* {{artlung}}'s accomplishments for the year are many:
** https://lab.artlung.com/ is {{artlung}}'s old site revamped this year after years of decay. https://lab.artlung.com/webmentions/
* https://youtu.be/rGwxdUsrhhY -- A BBC DJ reading out a url with all its parts! 1995

* I hope everyone has an excellent last Europe HWC of the year! - James
** One of the things I am proudest of this year is challenging myself to write different types of content: poetry, tutorials in new areas, design, and more. Looking back across blog posts, I feel like "hey, I have explored quite a lot this year!" That makes me happy :)
** For next year, I am looking forward to doing more writing! I'd like to do more poetic writing.

Appologies for showing up late, enabling the "transcribe" feature and not turning on a camera. I am at a very old PC which does not even have a camera and I was looking for a chat option (which I have now found here). -- Olav (from Bonn, Germany)
