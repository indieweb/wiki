WML
* https://lab.artlung.com/wml/
* https://microformats.org/wiki/wml (stubbed during the call)
* https://blamba.de has a working WML document
* https://blamba.de/?page=faq has interesting answers around how these works, it seems as though only a vintage phone can create the experience of WAP browsers and WML markup

* Nokia simulator: https://900kunder.com/mobile-site-simulator/nokia.htm (works with Joe's WML page)
** (but it's probably not an actual WML simulator)
** It is a simple iframe. The browser actually looks like it nullifies the xml declaration <?xml version="1.0"?> to <!--?xml version="1.0"?-->. But still, neat!
