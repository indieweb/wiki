how can people who aren't coders contribute to the IndieWeb?

== Pre-chat for November 6 pop-up ==
* A vision for the future of the internet -- in contrast to the Crypto Web3 "vision"
* Movement to buck the status quo of the internet 
** IndieWeb says the silos ruined things, let's pull back to the "good old days"
** Crypto wants to walk "forward" to a new paradigm
* a challenge = Web3 has the appearance of making people money, so it's easy to get a lot of people psyched about it because they hope to earn money from its success
