== Notes ==

* Welcome, everyone!

=== Libraries are Wonderful ===
** Library cards
** Your library card can often get you access to more than just books in your local building.
*** [[Calibre]]
*** Libby
*** https://standardebooks.org/
*** https://www.kanopy.com/
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlibrary_loan

*Other Physical Cards
** physical cards of sorts
** transit tickets
** paper money
*** Alan Turing is on the 50 GBP note

===Dictionaries: ===
* {{capjamesg}} mentioned his library card does not have access to an Oxford's dictionary.
* Do libraries have access to the old 1913 Webster's dictionary? It is extremely writer-centric and has long flowery explanations.
* https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary
* You can access the Oxford English Dictionary online
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidisestablishmentarianism

Paper vs Digital:
* There are at least 3 studies showing that although there is no difference in reading speed, paper does have better reading comprehension performance because of spatial and tactile cues.

** Kupietz when I do a search for site:www.kupietz.com it prompts me to "Try Google Search Console www.google.com/webmasters/ Do you own www.kupietz.com? Get indexing and ranking data from Google." —thanks, I think that's just a standard little google promo for GSC. I do get that too but it says "promoted", it's just an ad. --{{kupietz}}
*** If Google is important to you probably jumping through their hoops is in your interest. -- {{artlung}}
*** update, just since we discussed it, current Desktop Google PageSpeed scores for my gargantuan homepage, after all caching has been regenerated: 97/100/100/100 https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-michaelkupietz-com/qv0np828kc?form_factor=desktop (Mobile still needs work.) {{kupietz}}

* James' demo https://jamesg.blog/2024/11/13/organising-content-by-theme/
** https://jamesg.blog/collections/for-swifties/
* Jo's blog post: https://dead.garden/blog/day-trip-to-my-first-indiewebcamp-in-berlin.html

Original Content vs External Sources
* {{alabut}} is wondering how people with static sites mix in activity from other social media and websites into their own blogs or CMS.
* https://chsmc.org/ - mini posts are subtly darker in color than the longer posts
* https://nicksimson.com/ - blends his likes, bookmarks, and etc with his blog posts
* OG bloggers like John Gruber and Jason Kottke have been doing this for ages: https://daringfireball.net/ and https://kottke.org/

* HATHTCUC
* I think we should call it it "Homebrew Website Club & Virtual Algonquin Roundtable" ({{kupietz}})
 
* https://ragt.ag/usbahcm
* "you might have a cookie issue"
* https://ragt.ag/pads/p/2024--11--07--u8
** A good example of the collabortative writting (even if for shitposting)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-band_signaling "In telecommunications, in-band signaling is the sending of control information within the same band or channel used for data such as voice or video."
* Jupyter Notebooks https://jupyter.org/
* It also is reminding me of how Twitch is supposed to be - fun and such
* https://etherpad.org/ can be integrated into another website
* "The street finds its own uses for things"

* https//ft.com/404 - economists explain why the page was not found

* Just implemented, thanks to {{capjamesg}} for demonstrating the utility: https://michaelkupietz.com/blank/

=== comics ===
* [[comics]]
* 2018 IWC session: [[2018/serials]]

== {{artlung}} latest changes on his site ==
* New page - https://artlung.com/comics/ which is more unified way to show a list of items vs https://artlung.com/blog/category/comics (which is a different kind of presentation) and https://artlung.com/blog/tag/comics which pulls in blog posts I've tagged with comics but don't represent specifically. 
* New sidebars on the site linked from the footer which loads hamburger menus for search and for a rough sitemap. Initially implemented them using the nonexistent `<sidebar>` tag (which worked in Chrome, Safari and Firefox! despite not implementing a custom element (which would not work since it lacks a dash). Thanks to {{capjamesg}} I was able to fix this and make it an `<aside>` tag. TIL THERE IS NO SIDEBAR TAG.
* Implemented a new header https://artlung.com/headers/-20241112 which uses `image-rendering: pixelated` which I learned because of a presenter at IWC 2024 Berlin
