- Book: Technofeudalism by Yanis Varoufakis
	- Talked about in the context of the current landscape of oligopolies that charge cloud rent and how the indie web is an example of people seizing back control.
	- The term "Adverserial Interoperability" (or "Competitive Compatibility") popularized by Cory Doctorow was discussed in the context of technologies like ActivityPub that significantly reduce the switching costs

* "HTML Web Components" is the name coined for progressively enhanced web component without the use of Shadow DOM: https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/
** Very much a jQuery style of construction
* This is a very useful resource on understanding the difference between Light DOM and Shadow DOM: https://www.mayank.co/blog/declarative-shadow-dom-guide/
** This contains info and links to how CSS works in the shadow DOM context, and also a few usecases for when shadow DOM is particularly well suited
* The Shadow DOM is perfectly isolated and some styles cascade through into it. This resource succinctly highlights what styles pierce the shadow DOM by default: https://open-wc.org/guides/knowledge/styling/styles-piercing-shadow-dom/

* Based on the Wikipedia, .com was created in 1985: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com, so one could register domain back then.

* We would also like to see more prespective from the non-English or non-Western perspective to why the personal websites are important or internet being fun. 
** There are some cultural and infrastructure differences in personal web. For example, in Ecuador the Meta has so much power, that in covid, classes took place in Facebook groups
** What do we want the blog to become? Some people can live on Instagram and post everything, but would not post the same things on the blog. There are things we do not post on the blogs.
** Some people do have the knowledge of creating webpages, but they don't create one
** Do people want the TikTok and similar media...
** Blog can be many different things - we currently see a very limited ways of what blogs can be
** Personal sites also don't need to be a blog - what is the best way to express oneselves
** We get influenced and inspired by the creativty of other people

There was a discussion about what was inspiring. 
** People can be inspired by other people writing and seeing the things done by other people: either things we did not know they could be done or what we want to do

** People can be inspired by anything they read and all can influence us

The standards in the Japanese web is way too different. People get blocked in the fandom spaces for rebloging the screenshort from the movies. The linking is also different. I don't understand it.
