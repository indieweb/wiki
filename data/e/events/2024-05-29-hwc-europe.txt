== Notes ==
Welcome to Homebrew Website Club!
* These are our show notes.
* https://artlung.com/blog/2024/05/29/the-web-is-better/ - the code itself is https://gist.github.com/artlung/49b96f3800a4498922da2f5aa6144b23 - the code is not simple because to do "dynamic HTML" at the time one had to write multiple paths for code
* {{Ros}} was inspired by a talk by Kathy Sierra https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra who talks about stages of learning and moving more of our knowledge to the "autopilot" part of our brains. She has been using CodePen to experiment with different treatments to various kinds of images
* {{artlung}} pointed to some CSS changes he has done and to his front page at https://artlung.com/ and to photos he absorbed into WordPress - e.g. https://artlung.com/photos/physics/
** Looking at progress across time is compelling for people! 
* {{capjamesg}} has a new build process for his site https://jamesg.blog/2024/05/27/designing-aurora/; and a new search engine which can attach to a single website https://jamesg.blog/2024/05/29/nanosearch/

* Book Ros is reading Meganets https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/david-b-auerbach/meganets/9781541774445/
* Reminiscing on instant messenger clients
** MSN Messenger was popular in NZ and Ecuador, as was ICQ.

** via [[social media]] page
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestreaming " is an act of documenting and sharing aspects of one's daily experiences online, via a lifestream website that publishes things of a person's choosing (e.g. photos, social media, videos)."
* the Twitter of 2006 really did allow and enable more personal expression, almost as a reaction to blogging, which had become somewhat gatekept, with its own "performance" expectations
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Nobody!_Who_are_you%3F
** The website I found this on: https://innig.net
* "Things can be a different way"
* the power of setting a good example
