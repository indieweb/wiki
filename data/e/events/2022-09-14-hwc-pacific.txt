** Armando: the hash can be addresses of houses (personal site) or skyscrapers (twitter, facebook). Then we would have lists (such as Angelo's the-street) that will work to put markers on the map and allow me to jump to sites relevant to me as part of Angelo's list. But it is not just Angelo's list, anyone can create their own list and I can follow or even join as many as I want. (Not sure that timestamp is really necessary to include in the hash)

* Idea to simplify whostyle/loading custom css and js: alternate embedabble that links to an embeddable version of your site (without navbar, footer, etc). i.e. that would allow mermaid code to show the visual graphs
** Armando: I can literally just use any RSS right now using granary as suggested by Angelo (no need to change code)

(Not making design recommendations but the types of websites that could be a 'model' for indieweb.camp - festivals, online courses, online learning communities, 'schools')
