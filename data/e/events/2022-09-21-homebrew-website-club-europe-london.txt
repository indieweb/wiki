You can use https://webmention.app to send webmentions automatically

Webmention Tic Tac Toe: https://jamesg.blog/tic-tac-toe/3/
** only show the most recent webmention so that the grid is a bit clearer
** automated webmention notifications would make this better

also webmentions with no UI at all becomes a ephemeral email of sorts.
in general separating the concept of the webmention notification from reading microformats and posting them in my own page could allow interesting implementations powered by webmention.
