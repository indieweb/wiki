* [[Salmention]]s
** Discussed different use cases involved
** Propagating comments either displayed on comment fragments or on h-entry of another comment
** (partially) supported in Wordpress plugin
* Microformats standardization process
** Process is currently easily clogged up
** Who is able to become a spec editor and how?
** Please note new implementations to help standardization
* [[Micropub-extensions]] Much more straightforward

* Vouch
** Intentially easy on receiver, more difficult on the sender
** "Where do I know you from?"
** Could publish a list of "Sites I link to" or "Sites that link to me"
** Also don't have granularity as to quality of relation (link/know != approve)
