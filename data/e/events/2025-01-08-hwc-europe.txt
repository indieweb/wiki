Read/watch/listen posts
* {{gRegor}} for Micropub requests and book covers, `featured` in the `h-entry` makes sense in case the consuming site (WordPress) doesn't support the `read-of` properties. [[Sparkles]] also adds the `photo` inside the `h-cite` in case sites parse that. TODO: document this on [[read]]
* {{gRegor}} short note suggesting that "want to read" is probably a [[want]] post instead of a [[read]] https://gregorlove.com/2020/06/i-am-proposing-a-session/
** Session: [[2020/West/indiereads]]

The goal for the 2025: Eat a lot of oats /  porridge
