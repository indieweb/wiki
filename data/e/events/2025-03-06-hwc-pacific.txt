** 2 ways to display Wordle results: https://btrem.com/temp/drafts/wordle  password protected page; username: indieweb  password: indieweb2024
** Mac VoiceOver test: it reads the banner, "show statistics", and footer as I keyboard navigate around.  I couldn't get it to say anything about the Wordle graphics
** The highlighting on "BTrem" makes the "Brian Tremblay" sound weird.  Looks cool, though!
