Idea:
* post a note on your site with general ideas about NYC meetup, submit it to https://news.indieweb.org and it will be included in the next [[this-week-in-the-indieweb]] newsletter, which is sent out on Friday afternoon. This might reach more [[NYC]] people than are regularly in chat.
** Here is an example of James announcing his event using news.indieweb.org - https://jamesg.blog/2023/07/19/build-a-website-in-an-hour-event/
* https://indiewebify.me/
* Try a general HWC meetup and move to themes after we see who shows up the first time.
