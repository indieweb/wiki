== Welcome to HWC! ==

== Libraries and books ==

* {{zachary.kai}} Just found this blog post on the supposed rarity friendliness: https://birming.com/rarity-friendliness/
* {{capjamesg}} mentioned https://taylor.town/junk
* https://mandarismoore.com/2025/02/08/homebrew-website-club-meeting.html

* Libraries are awesome. [https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/bruce-sterling/free_as_knowledge/ ''Free as Air, Free As Water, Free As Knowledge''] is a speech by Bruce Sterling from 1992 on the incredible subversiveness of libraries 

* Things to borrow/use in libraries:
** CDs (music/audiobooks
** DVDs
** Makerspaces
** Zines
** Graphic novels
** Meeting rooms
** Seeds (what? amazing!)
** "Borrow-a-person" (an hour of interesting people's time who volunteer)
** Historical documents
** Vinyl
** Cassetes
** Musical instruments
** Asking people questions who are specialists / have historical knowledge
* Things libraries should / maybe are already doing
** Web archiving?
** [https://hastingslot.myturn.com/library/inventory/browse Hastings Library of Things] 
** [https://olioapp.com/en/ Community sharing] 
** Zine collections

* James thinking: How do we make sure the values of the web are passed down through generations?

* Borrow a reader: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4M-_wOgHPs
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail
* Talking with folks on trains: interesting and enjoyable but seemingly more acceptable on long distance than communter lines. Ditto with buses
* Books people are reading as an opener for conversations with strangers

** https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44421460-before-the-coffee-gets-cold
** James now resolves to use Open Library or something other than GoodReads :D ** https://openlibrary.org/books/OL31947012M/Before_the_Coffee_Gets_Cold
*** Other Book Tracking Options

** Thing related to borrowing books that may interest people: https://tantek.com/2024/120/t1/library-of-infinite-loan

* Writing tools and collaborative writing tools
** WriteBook: https://once.com/writebook
** https://ellipsus.com/ - I heard a lot of good things about it, but did not try it
*** great webdesign on that site imo

* How James designs his homepage feed
** Post titles and show the first few sentences
** The homepage shows six posts
** RSS feed gets the full content and 20 posts
** James' RSS is generated from https://jamesg.blog/longform-feed
** James doesn't use "Read more" links

== Accessibility: Links and image alt text ==

* Descriptive text for links for screen readers to give people context
** Another method is using aria-labels or the title attribute

* Question: How to make five links in a sentence accessible?

* You can link with a bibliography instead of inline

* Don't use "logo" as the descriptor for a link to a homepage that contains an image
* [https://adrianroselli.com/2024/05/my-approach-to-alt-text.html ''"My approach to "Alt Text"''] by Adrian Roselli is well worth a read

* "coffee cat"
* "the fact there is no simple answer is correct"

* Some great links in this about comics and accessibilty https://epubsecrets.com/the-accessiverse-on-accessible-comics.php
 
* Accessibility for artwork: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/complex-images

* "it's funny how the design of a platform reinforces the way that you use it"

* Being interested in the web for its artistic potential
* Tension between usability and creativity
* prefers-reduced-motion
* The fun of making on the web

"TITLE OF ARTWORK - image described in detail below under the heading Image Description" " on https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/complex-images is unreadable in dark mode. - thanks for spotting - I'll get that fixed!


== Text Adventure Games (and accessibility!) ==
* Zork intro reference:
** https://gunkies.org/wiki/Zork#Introduction
** If you are interested ot learn about text-based adventure games the documentary [http://www.getlamp.com/ ''GET LAMP''] is well worth a watch and freely available 
** There are enough "interactive fiction" aka "text adventure" to have a wikipedia category: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Interactive_fiction_engines Interactive fiction engines]

* Adding an accessible introduction to a website that helps someone relying on assistive technologies picture the website. Things you can describe include:
** Layout
** Typography type

** Use skip intro / skip navigation / skip to the bottom / skip to the top

"TITLE OF ARTWORK - image described in detail below under the heading Image Description" " on https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/complex-images is unreadable in dark mode.
