== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!
** Starting the conversation with food continues: coffee, then chocolate. 

=== What Have We Been Doing On Our Websites This Week? ===

* {{pcarrier}} made a 255 byte webpage: https://pcarrier.com/smol
** {{t}} created a challenge for making these!
** {{zachary.kai}} is thinking about making one too. Update! Made it: https://lab.lunaseeker.com/tests/256bytes.html
** James made https://jamesg.blog/8bit
* {{zachary.kai}} has been doing some digital mending: refactoring code, fixing git connections, adding a new member to the Star Wars Webring (https://zacharykai.net/lists/starwars), and reorganizing the blogroll: https://zacharykai.net/blogroll
* {{vanderwal}} has been building out lab pages for search, image placement, and webmentions. They are not in the listing in the lab yet.
* https://benji.dog/blank
* {{alabut}} is playing with Obisidian in attempt to organize blog posts and not impressed so far (looks too much VS Code than a notes app)
* Ricardo just updated his /now page (https://www.ricardochavezt.com/now) and adjusted the layout of the /garden page so it doesn't look horrible in smaller screens

=== Further Discussions ===

* Slug Length
** Some HTML elements don't need a closing tag
** The longest slug is Limax cinereoniger

* Code Snippets
** https://benji.dog/code/import-letterboxd-watchlist/
** James is working on a design for code snippets. There is an example at https://jamesg.blog/code/example
** Could / when should snippets be blog posts?
** #l5 to get line five, #l5-10 to get lines 5-10

* TOCs on 11ty
** https://reillyspitzfaden.com/uses
** Conclusion from discussion: there doesn't appear to be an elegant way to add a TOC after the first few paragraphs in a web page.
