== Notes ==
* Page idea for {{zachary.kai}} from {{capjamesg}} - a list of Australian media people should know about/try
* [[IndieWeb_Movie_Club]]
** This month: Watch any version of Romeo & Juliet! https://marksuth.dev/posts/2025/02/indieweb-movie-club-feb-2025-romeo-juliet
* Introductions
* https://www.johnwalker.nl/
** James: The SGDs mention is cool!
** https://jamesg.blog/2025/02/12/sustainable-living
* Using your website to start conversations
** This is a fun part of running a website!
** And the conversation doesn't have to happen on platforms you don't own, like Facebook.
* Making websites green
** Minimal designs
** Using a host that uses renewable energy
** https://cat.org.uk/
* Unoffice Hours: https://unofficehours.com/
** People usually only book a conversation if they're keen to talk to you
** An interesting way of connecting one-on-one
* Everyone can share what interests them on their website
* Having a website encourages us to ask "who are we / who are we not?"
* Having a blog lets you build the habit of writing more
** Blogging as a mental gym
** Gyms have all the equipment you need, and plenty of benefits of going: meeting people, exercise, community.
** You've got to go to the gym to see the benefits
* When we write
** James: no set time, but he takes notes throughout the day, some of which become blog posts.
* https://betterweb.club/
* Self-hosting is a spectrum from running a server in your closet to a cloud host to using a silo.
** [[self_hosting]]
* Moving away from GitHub
** What are the benefits / trade-offs
** Discovery is harder on tools that aren't GitHub
** GitHub has a robust index of projects
** Community-oriented Git hosts may be interesting where you can see what other users are sharing (like Gitea)
** GitHub is a silo
* More people talking about indieweb principles is exciting; there is a growing realisation of the trade-offs of depending on large services.
* Google's dominance can come up in ways you wouldn't think
** Trying to access a spreadsheet someone shares
** Submissions for a magazine having to be in a particular document format
** Assumptions in form design (i.e. giving a phone number assumes you have a phone number; restricting a spreadsheet to Google users assumes all of the target audience has a Google account)
** Many people assume you have a social media account (i.e. Instagram) as a contact method

== What have you done with your website? ==

* {{artlung}} is hosting IndieWeb Carnival this month: "Affirmations" is the theme
** https://artlung.com/affirmations-ic/ (Day 19, 18 submissions so far! Join us!)
** Creating a new framework for pages on his site https://artlung.com/blog/2025/02/18/experimenting-with-new-pages/
* Posted the demo promised: https://turner.enemyterritory.org/shared/repo/user/carrvo/website/Journey-to-MIndie.html
** and POSSEd to YouTube https://youtu.be/TzNnigFu7l8?si=NbjKABdEGJTPEibd

* What we are working on with our websites this week
** Building a guestbook https://zacharykai.net/guestbook
** James is redesigning his website: https://jamesg.blog/graph-demo
*** Previous versions: https://jamesg.blog/assets/images/2024/06/previous_theme.webp
*** Another design concept: https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/16/learning-about-web-design
*** Some more designs recently at https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/20/designs-from-the-last-few-months
**** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas
**** A good solution for layouts with a specific structure in mind
* Posting TILs on our websites
** Simon Willison has a dedicated TIL site https://til.simonwillison.net/
** You can write short things
** Another example: https://jvns.ca/til/
* {{artlung}} Trying to work on lighter-weight new pages, like https://artlung.com/projects/
** Hoping to have a more intuitive way to do Webmentions

* Pages for a history of older versions of your website
** https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/info/history
** You were a member of a webring back in the first version linked on that page!

* Tool: Save your website to the Internet Archive
** https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/**
** With the trouble that archive.org had recently I setup an instance of https://archivebox.io/ for as a personal archive, just in case.

* Contact pages
** https://tantek.com/contact
** https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/contact
** Not having a contact form means bots cannot fill it out
** Question for designing: how many clicks does it take for someone to be able to reach out?
** Follow up: Can you put links directly to messaging apps?
** But your goal may not be to have a one-click solution.
** What matters is thinking about the design -- thinking about how much friction you want.
** Using your domain name as an ID, e.g. on discord.
** Downside of services offering usernames that allow "." as a character without domain name authentication is that "." can't be taken as verification.

* {{artlung}} has Doraemon on his desk today https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon
** And when I acquired that robot cat: https://artlung.com/blog/2015/12/22/christmas-new-bot-tuesday-everyones-favorite-transdimensional-robot-cat-doreamon/


* Fun: building your website in a 2000s aesthetic.
** Building a site in Windows XP

* Encouragements:
** Set up multi-factor authentication on your email, domain registrar, and web host.
** Consider putting a proper rel=icon on their homepage [[icon]]
*** Make a web manifest.json file that lets someone use your site as a progressive web app; there are lots of platform-specific features too.

* How we feel about having different categories of content
** TILs being a separate entity vs. being part of your main site
** Do all posts go in your RSS feed?
** What if Mastodon posts are a first-class part of a website?
** Idea: every day has a page that aggegates lots of content (short things, TILs, long form)

* Cultural Futures Conference 2025 - more info at https://www.culturalfuturesfoundry.com/conference-2025/
** Day 1: Inclusive communities (11am-3pm GMT on March 1st 2025)
** Day 2: Inclusive storytelling (11am-3pm GMT on March 2nd 2025)
** Online only, free to attend, but you need to book tickets via https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cultural-futures-conference-march-1st-and-2nd-2025-tickets-1237342487689
** {{lazcorp}} taking part in a panel on Day 2 about "Storytelling in the 21st-century"

* Having different post types on our websites
** /feeds page that lists different feeds your website supports
*** Example: https://benji.dog/feeds
** https://adactio.com supports several different types of feeds
** Having separate feeds adds a maintenance burden, but gives users options
** It would be good if web readers let you filter feeds by RSS category

* James' web reader, https://artemis.jamesg.blog (invite code "coffee"), supports filtering feeds
** Designed for high-volume feeds like news sites

* Web readers we use
** FreshRSS
*** FreshRSS https://www.freshrss.org/ has mechanisms for filtering and aggregating
** Inoreader
** ...

* https://www.pikapods.com/

* Benji: Drawing designs on post-it notes -- dreams for new designs
* James has been trying to sketch more designs

* Web reader features
** Allow a user to pause a feed for a while (maybe time-based); a snooze button on a feed, maybe more ideal for high-volume feeds.
** James' use case is for managing higher-volume feeds; he wants to stay subscribed, but not seeing the content for a while. (i.e. if you are taking a break from learning about a topic and want to snooze feeds)
** Move feeds into an archive folder
** Fraidycat RSS reader had a feature to select between real-time vs. slower cadences for polling.
** Inoreader supports adding Rules for managing your feed / categorising posts in a feed automatically.

* [[IndieWeb_Carnival]]
* Would people sign up to a notification that says when the next IndieWeb Carnival is out?
** James: there is something nice about the current setup where you seem to discover the next topic by following blogs
** Discovery vs. push
** IndieWeb Carnival RSS feed? Would reminders be helpful?
** feeds.indieweb.org
*** Carnival
*** This Week in the IndieWeb
** RSS feed for events
* Downsides of scheduling events automatically

* Ideas:

** Blog post on how we chose our domain names

* There is precedent for doing round-up posts after the Carnival month has passed
** Grouping links is always useful!
