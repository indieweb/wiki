== Notes ==
https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/index/ - trying to figure out how to hide tags only used once

== How to organize an online session? ==
* New page to capture notes: [[Pop-up_Organizing]]
** good times to hold events
** structure: length, breaks, etc
** review [[Homebrew_Website_Club#Online_Format]] for some information to merge into this new page^
** [[2021/Pop-ups#Scheduling_Brainstorming]]
** expectations for after the event - upload video / transcript / audio; transfer etherpad to wiki
** how to promote beforehand


== Transcription Testing / Thinking ==
* should transcript be in a GitHub to allow for editing, searching? 
* review for Code of Conduct violations in transcription errors
* do we need a transcription policy? 
** sample = Chatham House Rules
** difference in expectations between a Pop-Up event and HWC
--> need to discuss considerations on Meta - considerations for consent, silencing, accessibility, how much cleanup is needed / who would do that - weigh pros and cons


== Thinking about online events ==
* Will we want to continue pop-ups post pandemic? We expect yes
* Will we want to continue online HWCs post pandemic? Allows people in rural areas / areas without an in-person HWC to attend
* Is it possible to start collecting questions before an event? E.g. in etherpad - How would this be different from adding things to the wiki? <-- everyone can add to etherpad, only people who have set up wiki access can edit the wiki

== Ephemeral posts ==
* posts that are only useful / interesting for a short period of time
** wordle guesses
** "stories" that expire -- post type = story?
** [[expiring content]]
** [[story]]
** Aaron has stories functionality - indicated on icon
