* https://jamesg.blog/create
* You can create GitHub files with values in a query string:
** https://github.com/capjamesg/jamesg.blog/new/main/pages/posts?filename=2025-05-14-test123.md&value=---value of the post
*** where the ? is the start of the query string.

* What we're working on
** James is working on his edit bookmarklet
** Matthew made a bill of materials for his home server
** https://turner.enemyterritory.org/shared/repo/user/carrvo/website/homeserver-bom-calculator.html
** What are the costs of associated with running a home server?
** What would a website (software) bill of materials look like?
*** SBOM format (Software Bill of Materials) is becoming more popular.
*** Domain, server costs, CDN, DNS, illustrators who help with your site, GitHub, GitHub Actions / CI, -- what other costs are there?
** "tokei" lets you see what languages you are using and how many lines in each.
*** sloccount is related too
** https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei.
*** tokei is made in rust and is really fast.
*** supports JSON/YAML/etc. output if you want to render in HTML
** Manny is working on share buttons for his website

* [[test_in_production]]

* Querying your photos that match a condition (i.e. ones you have found on Wikipedia)
** Tagging your photos on Flickr so you can cite a Flickr URL for such sets, e.g. ones used in Wikiepdia articles, or in press articles

* https://tantek.com/appearances

* How does one become an extra in a film as a computer wizard?

	* you may want to have another attribute you use for RSS feeds if the title contains HTML, etc.

* Joe liked the two-way binding

* Blog post idea: List of frameworks you use on your website
