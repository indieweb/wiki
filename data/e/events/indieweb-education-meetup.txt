Indieweb Education Meetup is an online weekly forum in the summer of 2019 happening every Monday at 14:00 UTC. Each session uses Zoom video chat and an etherpad.

We share recommendations for getting started both as:  1) as a professional educator looking to model good IndieWeb practices with an appealing website and 2) as an instructor who would like to facilitate some first steps for students in this direction.
