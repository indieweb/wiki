{{lazcorp}}
* trying to get off third-party services - hoping to get rid of Google Fonts and Amazon S3/Cloudfront CDN and host them on my web server
* Added CSS for ::target-text to get Text Fragment links styled (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments)

{{danielmclaughlan}}
* considering hosting my media on Digital Ocean Spaces and making use of their CDN. Have created a Space and setup a subdomain with SSL, but yet to pull any media off
* Started adding Microformats to my profile and posts etc
Apologies, my internet went down. Just when it was getting (even more) interesting. Appreciated the chat, thanks.

Hosting and overage fees

* [[Netlify]] has had issues with this too, see criticism section
