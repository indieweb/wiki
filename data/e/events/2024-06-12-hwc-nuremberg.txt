We once again planned the details of the special [https://events.indieweb.org/2024/07/homebrew-website-club-n%C3%BCrnberg-digital-festival-edition-MpDAKz0jW4Cn Homebrew Website Club in July] that will be part of the [https://nuernberg.digital/ Nürnberg Digital Festival]. We already have 17 people interested in the event, which will unfortunately (due to a water damage caused by the heavy rain) not take place at [https://www.th-nuernberg.de/ Technische Hochschule Nürnberg]. Luckily Tilman was already able to find a backup. We plan to create some stickers as well and hope that some participants will join HWC Nuremberg permanently.

We then showed Richard, who was a first time participant, what the Homebrew Website Club and the IndieWeb movement is all about.
