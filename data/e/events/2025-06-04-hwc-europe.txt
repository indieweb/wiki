== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!
* Lego minifigures
* https://ko-fi.com/
* Using your website as your shop
** Listing different products on your site and adding PayPal links
** Using WordPress and WooCommerce
*** WP / WooCommerce can be quite opinionated
** What matters is figuring out something that meets your needs
* Having a scratchpad website to play around

* James has https://playground.jamesg.blog/, inspired by https://lab.artlung.com, which lists experimental projects.
* Just a nice directory listing for random stuff: https://files.serverless.industries/
* Your lab may be private, public, or psuedo-public (not linked anywhere)
* Having a staging place for your website.
** Having a button to press to create a clean staging environment.

* The fun of playing around with HTML/CSS
** "I fixed that; I solved the puzzle; now it's doing it's thing!"
** HTML/CSS is easy to change.

* RSVPs
** [[rsvp]]
** HTML example: [[rsvp#How_to_RSVP_with_HTML]]
** You can use the p-rsvp property to say that you want to RSVP to a page, then set a value=maybe/yes/no

* Redirecting feeds from FeedBurner to your website
** [[FeedBurner]]

* [[food]]
* Sharing stickers you have seen on your website
** Stickers at concert areas, bars, on laptops, lamposts
* https://dead.garden/blog/interactive-guide-of-my-jacket.html
* From Chaos:  https://mwarning.github.io/chaos-sticker-collection/
* https://www.graff-city.com/egg-shell-stickers-m53
* "parody stickers"
** UK rail tickets

** Could these be on a web page?
* People putting stickers on notebooks

* The similarities between the indie web and zine culture
* The zine is an early example of making a thing, sticking it out there, and seeing others read it
* Zine making workshops / libraries exist

* https://www.babandfriends.com/

* Privacy by obscurity for publishing web pages

* What is the least amount of CSS you can use to design a web page that's easy to read?
* CSS templates for your website
* Designing one-off pages
* {{alabut}} made a quick page to share semi-privately with bicycling friends: https://alabut.com/projects/bikepacking/
* Feel free to view the source, it's insanely simple and based on this template: https://alabut.com/projects/halfnaked/

James asked about a simple set of styles to always start from
* {{t}}'s undo-html.css and simple.css
** https://tantek.com/2025/elementica.css is for this purpose
* NES CSS: https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/
* dedicated CSS files for unbreaking HTML defaults, a simple base, and one that expresses site-specific styles.

* Modularising CSS
** Creating individual files for different components?
** James' notes on utility classes he would use
*** side-by-side -- two columns
*** typography resets: margin/padding above and below headings
*** no-bullet-points -- no bullet point lists w/ no padding

* Should you learn Sass?
** Sass has includes support that lets you create a unified file from individual files (so you don't need to make network requests for each stylesheet)

* Zoom's audio isolation fills out a coffee grinder

* Has anyone made a website with train tickets from around the world?

* https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2067p12d21o

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=train+ticket&title=Special%3AMediaSearch&type=image
* Idea: design your website like a railway ticket! (railway.css :D)
* https://www.sfgate.com/local-donotuse/article/The-26-people-on-San-Franciscos-Muni-ticket-mural-12537768.php
** What is the website equivalent of "printing a ticket" for someone?
