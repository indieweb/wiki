== Notes ==
* Poker Face, John Mulaney
* Reilly's menus, from FrESH #027 - {{artlung}} has not yet gotten to look at this but wants to

* Promises https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
* btrem is working on a tool to create footnotes in 11ty and seeing how to create an 11ty plugin
example page with a footnote: https://btrem.com/2025/04-addtemplate  (done with a simple function, not with the plugin, which at the moment does not work.)  :(

* Reilly updated their h-card so their photo shows up on webmentions, e.g. the RSVP on this event: https://events.indieweb.org/2025/05/homebrew-website-club-americas-38aqOgHBPN0F
** Webmention bookmarklets

* Bridgy Classic: when publishing by [[Webmention]] trigger, the Bridgy response should include the permalink for the silo post, so post processing can pull in the link and show it as a syndication link "also appears on". The WordPress Syndication Links plugin has code built in that handles that, for reference: [[Syndication_Links]]

** {{gRegor}}: in PHP land, I use this small lib for normalizing URLs of various types: https://sabre.io/uri/
*** And apparently it's based on this Node lib, which might be more helpful fof you, Reilly: https://nodejs.org/api/url.html
*** and it's a composer module! nice. https://sabre.io/uri/install/
