=== Responsive hamburger menus ===
** popover - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover
* https://web.dev/blog/popover-api
** Popover Polyfill: https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill
** CodePen experimenting with a popover https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/gOJYxxj?
** Relevant issue discussing opening popover from CSS: https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/771

* CSS shorthand property `background` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style

* old-school way to do it with a checkbox and label and adjacent selector https://codepen.io/kevinmarks/pen/pomzrZv

{{gRegor}}: No hamburger icon, but I set up a CSS-only, no-form version using `:target` selector:

* via tutorial: https://shellcreeper.com/full-css-responsive-navigation-toggle-no-javascript/

=== Scroll animation styles ===
* https://www.akaivyc.com/
** https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/PXVEVZ
** https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/NWPGvjW
* Scroll https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollBy
* Greensock has a js toolkit to do subtle scroll effects https://gsap.com/scroll/
* d3.js has a lot of power for scrolling things too https://vallandingham.me/scroller.html

=== Locating images in source ===
* Variety of ways to include image from <img> to CSS to JS
* {{gRegor}} in our test with vogue.com, using Inspector in Chrome on Windows, I found if I hovered over the `<source>` element, over each image URL in the `srcset` attribute, the one that was displayed ("current") showed a popover with preview, dimensions, and URL of the "Current Source". Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/jDyNHUx
* We learned about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/currentSrc as a result

=== Dark mode ===
* Dark mode - is this a good method? https://www.bram.us/2023/10/09/the-future-of-css-easy-light-dark-mode-color-switching-with-light-dark/
** Basic dark mode using `light-dark()` function https://caniuse.com/?search=light-dark https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/OJYLjKY 
** Can I Use - https://caniuse.com/ - shows support in different browsers
** {{adactio}} at IndieWebCamp https://adactio.com/journal/15941 and later toggling: https://adactio.com/journal/17086


=== Topics to discuss ===
* Something flexy I don't know what it would be called - pulling a date out of a list (live code!)
** example: https://read.cv/iggy - date is in another column at full width, collapses inline at mobile width
** flex
** grid-area with media queries
** https://codepen.io/benjifs/pen/wvbwrMv
** box sizing nuances (margin versus box width) https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/boxes/

* Browser support (specifically testing on older browsers)
** need help troubleshooting an issue someone told me about but I can't reproduce I suspect is browser related ;)
