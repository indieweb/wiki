== Joe's Background Today ==
* Background today is from the wikipedia page of Li-Chen Wang - a usage of the term "copyleft" from 1976 which Wang, a person who was active in the early bay area Homebrew Computer Club  helped popularize. 
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang
** Copyleft: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">Copyleft is the legal technique of granting certain freedoms over copies of copyrighted works with the requirement that the same rights be preserved in derivative works. In this sense, freedoms refers to the use of the work for any purpose, and the ability to modify, copy, share, and redistribute the work, with or without a fee. Licenses which implement copyleft can be used to maintain copyright conditions for works ranging from computer software, to documents, art, and scientific discoveries, and similar approaches have even been applied to certain patents.</blockquote>

** Why is copyleft a part of Front End Study Hall?
** Eric: Mechanically the web is copyleft! We hand it over in a form that is easily modifiable
** Ross: class of licenses are copyleft: about sharing, and about virality of the copyright, anything you make you must share, creative commons
*** Examples: GPL, Mozilla Public License, CC BY SA
** Default etherpads come with this:
<blockquote>Please note that all contributions to this pad and other IndieWebCamp documents are considered to be released under the public domain according to CC0.</blockquote>
** {{vanderwal}} - distinction between the code and the content, "implicit copyright" 
** REUSE specification helps you attribute / declare licenses in machine readable way: https://reuse.software/
** Mini-rant on why it matters: https://social.rossabaker.com/@ross/115543816752177029

* Ross' Tilde Site: https://tilde.town/~rossabaker/
** https://tilde.town/~rossabaker/copyright.html
** Copy and paste text and from where it comes from - Thomas suggests - attribution - hyperlinks are a reason to get things from "show the receipts"
** ''The care of this is so terrific Ross!'' - Joe

== <code>blockquote[cite]</code>? ==
From Eric: how many of you have you used blockquote and cite *attribute*?
Eric: any blockquote that includes a cite attribute should be treated like a href! (lovely)
* I went down a minor rabbit hole around blockquotes and quotebacks in a lab page - https://lab.vanderwal.net/blockquote-plus.html

* [https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2025/10/29/custom-asidenotes/ Eric's Custom Asidenotes] 

* Figure had a <credit> subelement
* Footnote elements (so say we all)
* How did browsers implement this? (They did not?)

== Topics for Today ==
* Things you can't do in Figma that you can do in CSS? Is it possible to do in Figma?
** {{nsmsn}} ''we didn't get back to this!'' 

* [[cite]]
* https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/month-notes-oct-2025 reads the cite="" attribute and adds a user-viewable section

* ''To Whom It May Concern! I want more semantic meaning out of HTML''
* [[rel=home]]
* [[rel=me]]
* Trust webs - rel me - you can trust this account is also me
* [[Mastodon]] rel=me gives you a verification
* LiveJournal used OpenID
* ''That's why we had XHTML Friends Network'' [[XFN]]

== How do you present high-density information in blogrolls? ==
** https://vanderwal.net/links.php#personal
*** tags for each site? sort by the tags?
*** how about screenshots of the site?
*** sort into a grid?
** Jo describes a great site of links, what's new
*** Phil Gyford runs and manages the ooh.directory that has 2,358 blogs that are categoriezed - https://ooh.directory

* Pat's digital garden site https://garden.patsitive.co.nz/ does a hover+preview behavior (similar to how WordPress backend and WordPress.com does previews)
** Uses Digital Garden for Obsidian to convert Markdown to HTML using Eleventy static-site generator - https://dg-docs.ole.dev
** Discord server for same plugin:  https://discord.gg/Z46n2RNX8e
* Visual previews of websites on blogrolls are really powerful - James is building it in a browser now. 
** Simon Willson's shot-scraper that is part of his datasette offering - https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/
*** https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/14/automating-screenshots/
** Simon Willison is a brilliant web creator, a kind of chef of the web
** Simon Willison made Lanyd - an event site https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanyrd
** Natalie is his partner and also is a creator
** Simon also created Git Scraper that uses GitHub commits and GitHub Actions to scrape a site and captures the diff - https://simonwillison.net/series/git-scraping/
* Advocate to Httparchive for user affordance - is this a thing that exists?
** look for usage of blockquote with cite attribute in httparchive
** Piggyback on enhanced attr() support in 
** <nowiki><abbr></nowiki> element?
** <nowiki><blockquote cite=""></nowiki>
** why did you put that thing on that site that created a dotted line? ABBR might be https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/abbr
*** {{artlung}} was asked to "remove the dotted lines" on links in 2001 https://lab.artlung.com/the-problem-with-blur/

* Also in plain text, the abbr (or expansion) is often in parens after first usage, e.g.:
* FrESH (Front End Study Hall) is a cool meetup! You should join us at FrESH.
or
* Front End Study Hall (FrESH) is a cool meetup! You should join us at FrESH.

How do you mark those up with abbr / ARIA to connect the abbreviation with its expansion?

What markup patterns are people using?

* [https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/xbVZGOr CodePen with an example of the abbr with title attribute]

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby

* Book show and tell
* Teach yourself HTML &. CSS Visually
* Dictionaries!
* DOCTYPE
** https://vole.wtf/doctype/
** Type in code from a paper magazine
*** BASIC listings in 3-2-1 Contact magazine: how kids learned in the 1980s
* Visualize All 23 Years of BYTE Magazine in All Its Glory, All at Once
** https://www.404media.co/byte-magazine-zoomable-map-archive/
- https://byte.tsundoku.io/
** https://openseadragon.github.io/ is the code being used
** {{dead.garden}} will do a blogroll!
 
* {{capjamesg}}'s code was:
<nowiki>
<figure style="margin: 0;">
  <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://screenshots.jamesg.blog/?url=https://vanderwal.net">
  <figcaption style="margin-top: 1rem;">vanderwal.net</figcaption>
</figure></nowiki>

** ^I like that it generates them new so it's always up to date!

* https://www.11ty.dev/docs/services/screenshots/ is a good service to capture screenshots of web pages

* OpenSeadragon - https://openseadragon.github.io - to tile large images so they are easily zoomable

* Yahoo historical pages https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/yahoo-website
