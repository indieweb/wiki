=== What ===
<div class="p-description">
What happens when an online service you use freezes your account, loses your data, or goes out of business? Have you ever used a service by a company that suddenly went under, stranding your data? What happened to the Internet in 2003?Do you own your own identity or do you sharecrop? Who owns your data and why? Case will talk about data ownership, identity and the Indie Web, a movement that is taking back ownership of one's own identity and data instead of sharecropping on 3rd party websites.

This is the 3rd event in a series of free monthly FutureTalks from disruptive Developers, innovative Technologists and world-changing Creatives. Doors open at 5:30p for food and drinks, and the presentation will begin right at 6p.
