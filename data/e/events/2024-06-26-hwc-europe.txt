{{lazcorp}} has been working on ActivityPub integration for his blog
Don't try to follow it yet on Mastodon etc - it doesn't fully work yet!
* Webfinger endpoint: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/webfinger?resource=acct:artists-notebook@www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk
* Profile (Actor) endpoint: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/activityPub/users/artists-notebook
* Outbox endpoint: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/activityPub/users/artists-notebook/outbox
Based primarily on: https://rknight.me/blog/building-an-activitypub-server/ (and a few other tutorials)
Webfinger endpoint tested with https://feditest.org/ and - after a bit of work - now passes all tests
Once the blog is fully working with ActivityPub the plan is to do Notes and then Artwork as two more ActivityPub enabled accounts/sections
