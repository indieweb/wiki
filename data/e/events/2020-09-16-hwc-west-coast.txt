Chris posting media using [[IFTTT]] to WordPress from his Android phone using [[micropub]]. All the photos he takes with his phone automatically create draft posts with contemporaneous meta data to be posted later. Some details at https://boffosocko.com/2020/01/21/using-ifttt-to-syndicate-pesos-content-from-social-services-to-wordpress-using-micropub/

{{t}} fixed layout bugs on his home page that were causing a horizontal scrollbar, and kept the feature of having his photo posts in his stream extended out to the very edges of the screen on mobile (full bleed).
* {{gwg}} asked for a URL to see photo posts
