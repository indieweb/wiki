* Welcome to a special, weekend edition of HWC!

*  Jason Cosper, faced with comment management, added office hours for when he can accept comments:
** https://jasoncosper.com/no-comments-after-business-hours/
** WordPress, requires blocks editor
* When James designed [[Artemis]], he wanted there to be a log out button on every page.
** The software is designed to read, then log out and do something else.
** Like Club Penguin having a logout button on the main gameplay page.
* Tools make us more likely to do something
* 'Super Log-Off'? Teens Bring Street Smarts to Facebook (2010)
** https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/super-log-off-teens-bring-street-smarts-facebook/story?id=12131071
** "Mikalah, for example, an 18-year-old teenager interviewed by boyd, has already hopped between five high schools, and doesn't just log out of Facebook when she goes offline. She deactivates her account altogether."
* Our interfaces shape our behavior

* Books I've read that significantly influenced how I see the world.

Challenge of writing about politics
* How do you write in a less inflamitory way
* Focus on the issue rather than on the parties
* "This post is three years old" disclaimers on your website; a way to indicate a post is aging.
** The Guardian does this.
* Helpful to have dates on content that can go out of date (e.g. software libraries)

* How do we promote the older articles on our website?
* How do dates impact how we perceive whether a website is active?
* Weekly or annual posts can feel strange if not posted on a consistent schedule
** {{aciccarello}} is currently 2 years behind on an annual birding post
* {{aciccarello}} would still like to post the draft of his trip 5+ years ago
* Dates give context to an article
* Some posts could easily be years old or very new, but are hard to tell
* An old post that is still true can hold more weight than a recent hot take
* Having related links can give context and make it easy to learn more about a topic
* Previous/next links are easy to add navigation but it isn't always topical
* {{aciccarello}} Has had some series (e.g. [https://www.ciccarello.me/travel/2019/italy/ Italy Travel]) and would link back to the series start.

* James noted discomfort from looking back at his old posts
** You may be -- delightfully -- surprised about something you wrote on the past!

Retroactively posting that you didn't post in a month.
* "this month [un]intentionally left blank"

* garden metaphor: how gardens are made of lots of plants
** Just like our websites!
* Comments can be rapidly spreading weeds :(

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_Explainer - uses only the 1000 most common English words

* What is the best way to ask a question and get a response from lots of people, in the context of collaborative building?
** GitHub PRs aren't ideal for a lot of people.
** Depends on the audience.
** "What if I wanted a creative paragraph that doesn't contain the letter E?", and assemble all examples from bloggers and non-bloggers.
** https://www.bulwer-lytton.com/2024 facilitates submissions from lots of people.
** Having an easy way to share the post.
** Communicating how you plan to use the data is essential.
** Copyright is a question; Creative Commons can help. It has 30-40 languages translated.

public domain contains no "e"s

Stream of thought: making collective things.

Projects that come to mind:
    - Collaborative writing with others
    - Internet Phone Book
    - Good Internet Magazine (https://goodinternetmagazine.com/)
    - Alt Text Selfies (https://alttextselfies.net/)

Idea: [https://www.ciccarello.me/posts/2024/02/14/plant-blog/ place to share plant growth online]

* Plants growing through the cracks in the concrete.
* Watching trees grow over long periods of time.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleus_scutellarioides is the tree on {{jo}}'s desk
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poinsettia

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficlets

* Opportunities for exquisite corpse creativity

* https://marigold.town/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habbo
* T-Nature, yes {{Artlung}} has a robot on the theme of nature, (Anthony and Jo and Michael showed off plants of theirs1)
** https://artlung.com/blog/2020/04/30/new-bot-day-welcome-nature-cup_o_teag-gave-this/
** This is great ^^

* User control / curation
** Doomscroll is the opposite -- when the algorithm gives you things that you don't really fully control.
** Tuning the levers should a feature.

* What is the web equivalent of "layers", like in music?
** Is it like a long press or hover?
** Technically: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer
** Graphic maps between web links, like a digital garden map

* Artistic productions have multiple layers of meaning, implicit and explicit.

* Web layers
** Some people go to your homepage
** Some people read often but don't click around every page
** Some people read lots on your site

* We all know our own websites the best

* Layers in terms of keeping your content organised.

* Building your site to award exploration
** Intention for Michael in his website design

* Blog post idea: Your favourite HTTP status code.
* https://http.cat
* James blog post idea: 302 Found

* Do we have a list of IndieWeb Carnival ideas?
** Should we make one on the wiki page?

* Could plants be a topic?
