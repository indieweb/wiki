== Notes ==

=== Let's talk about what we did on our site recently! ===

* {{artlung}} I don't know where this fits but since the last meeting I implemented jwz's hack to import comments from Mastodon into my site. It works by reading my own posts and looking for sites which link to posts which begin https://artlung.com/blog and then for any reply on that post (including my own) will be imported as a comment in my WordPress site. It uses the php https://www.jwz.org/hacks/mastodon-to-wp-comments.php and also the perl file https://www.jwz.org/hacks/mastodon-upload.pl - that had the side effect of importing a nice comment from Al https://artlung.com/blog/2024/01/24/al-my-friendship-as-garden-theory/ which was great. It works as an hourly cron and imports the comments then. The documentation specifically says that it's not an ActivityPub implementation, in some ways it's analgous to how I use IFTTT to import my Instagram posts.

* {{gwg}} wants to write more content and maybe a little less feature enhancement...or maybe more of both

{{gRegor}} I found a dependency conflict in some of my custom plugins that broke my IndieAuth, wee! Currently working on fixing it by scoping dependencies to each plugin.
* I think I got it fixed!

{{nsmsn}} Since two weeks ago, I figured out how I broke ActivityPub on my site: https://nicksimson.com/posts/i-broke-activitypub/ and in response to starrwulfe, shared my plugin settings: https://nicksimson.com/posts/my-activitypub-settings/

{{btrem}} I published a "own your wordles" page on my site https://btrem.com/feed/wordle
And I'm currently trying to make an 11ty plugin to allow others to post wordle scores on their own site.

{{alabut}} is bone tired from a weekly blogging cadence... and another post is due tonight! This is only Week 3 and already forcing me to think about the underlying habits and tools it takes for publishing consistency.

Also I tried to reboot my CSS layout by transitioning from an old version of Bootstrap to newer modern CSS Grid techniques and used the same strategy as {{artlung}} - ripping out all existing styles and layering on new ones. I only got halfway through implementation, it works on desktop but I couldn't figure out how to customize it for mobile.

{{angelo}} I've been working on analyzing the code hosted on my website -- https://ragt.ag/code/projects -- now each project displays the various types of lines of code found and calculates ratios between them to represent documentation coverage and whitespace utilization.

I've also experimented with a gather.town-esque 2d tiled environment to move from one video chat room to another.

Joe, you could participate in https://css-naked-day.github.io/ while updating your CSS - intriguing. I remember seeing this in the past.  And it's April 9. I do have some CSS that's inline in style attributes but this could be fun. adding it to my calendar for my consideration.

Zegnat at the last IWC removed most of the CSS from his page: https://vanderven.se/martijn/ - still works ok

{{aciccarello}} has also played around with Gather with some coworkers.

=== IndieWebCamps ===

* {{aciccarello}} is still looking to post about [[IWC SD]]
* ...so is {{alabut}} and would love to share a draft for feedback when it's ready, before sharing with the larger web

* Need to pick a location for IWC Sacramento [[Planning#Sacramento,_CA]]

* Train from San Diego to LA is currently closed for track repair. Would be fun to do another [[IndieWebTrain]].

I think [[2019/SF]] was the last Bay Area IWC

TODO lists https://ragt.ag/todo
* {{aciccarello}} has a list of draft posts which are explicitly not permalinks https://www.ciccarello.me/drafts/ and sometimes creates [https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22blog+post%22 github issues]. Considering listing potential ideas on the draft page too.
