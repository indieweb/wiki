== Notes ==
* posts vs pages 
** {{artlung}} is collating short old posts into pages
** making lists of posts to combine -- can make it easier for readers to find old posts
*** {{jamesg}} has archive pages that collect all posts on a topic
* feels like "cheating" to revise old posts aside from addendums / corrections
** comparison with digital garden ethos of continually updating pages
** affordance of online publishing versus print -- is possible to update online
** Johnny Decimal is a means to organize your files so you can find them. A lot of writing is looking at research or notes collected over time: https://johnnydecimal.com/
** I want to know what I wrote on this day and will not look at database or git history
* Scrivener: https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview - tool for fiction writing
* switching between pages and posts
** Redirection plugin for WordPress - https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/ {{artlung}} also recommends!
* ways to present older pieces: 
** James wrote a piece about https://jamesg.blog/2024/05/23/sharing-older-blog-posts/ 
** favorite posts, greatest hits, start here 
** end of year round-ups, weekly round-ups
** link to old posts in new posts
** "previously" at bottom of post
* how do people feel about the appropriate number of links in a post? 
** linking style: links in endnotes or footnotes versus directly in the text / inline
** SEO "best practices" versus personal linking style / preferences 
** links as desserts on top of a meal versus "pre-requisites" for understanding
* style guide for bloggers? do bloggers document their styles? do bloggers follow 'official' style guides?
** [[style-guide]]
** {{artlung}} mentioned remembering a style guide for blogging, it's possible I was thinking of "The Web Style Guide" (first edition 2002: https://www.webstyleguide.com/ )
	"A style guide can be a great resource for establishing and supporting style guidelines. A resource like a style guide is particularly useful in a distributed content production environment, where multiple authors across the organization are contributing content to the site."
** specifically considering embeds
** Jamie Tanna: Blogumentation: https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/
** referring to sites by the author's name versus their website's name
** including a description of how to link to you on your website -- "preferences"
*** interacts with author's goals for the site, who they are writing for
* changing opinions about what we want published on our sites
** LLMs don't have the right of removal, unlike search enginges
** possible to opt out of archive.org
** Search Engine Hostility https://dead.garden/blog/search-engine-hostility.html not all of us want to be in search engines and find readers via search engines
** how we feel about older content -- cringe at seeing past opinions we've changed
*** digital doesn't show its age unless it renders poorly
*** including automatic notes to call out older content
** ex: name change of "dark patterns" --> "deceptive patterns"
** shitposting -- ephemeral value
** {{artlung}} knows that he can't shitpost out of some instinct that the web will remember and I can't disclaim responsibility for it
* how do we decide what's good enough quality to go on our blogs / websites?
** having the vague impression of good enough
** is it written for other people or for me
** publish everything finished
** publish what was written for me (it is cool if you like it or if you don't) - and I even wrote a comic about the Zappa quote I was thinking of https://artlung.com/blog/2020/02/02/zappa-comic/
** whatever the feeling of compulsion to share is there
** what I want to refer back to
** depends on the length - longer have higher standard
** purpose - like the short pieces, that can serve to continue the discussion, can be less polished
** depends on the audience - like don't want to piss off people
** the web is forgiving of minor mistakes (e.g. typos) -- people are largely reading for content
* who are we writing for? at what point in the writing process do we consider audience?
** writing for ourselves by default
** e.g. considering an international audience -- avoid local colloquialisms  - down even to if I share a measurement - "I walked 3 miles" there are times where I've included the measurement in kilometers too.
** don't assume the reader knows everything you do -- have an article be something that makes sense on its own
** {{artlung}}: sometimes a post that's a bit like vaguebooking feels like the right thing to write when what Iwant to communicate is more intense than I can do justice too. From dictionary.com: "vaguebooking is the practice of making a post on social media, primarily Facebook, that is intentionally vague but highly personal and emotional"
** considering an audience when choosing between topics -- might be more likely to write about what we think others will also be interested in 
** considering the balance of posts -- don't want to write about the same topic too much
* short posts and notes
