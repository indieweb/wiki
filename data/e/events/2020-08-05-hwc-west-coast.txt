== Possible Topics ==
* naming of [[Indigenous]] - what do people think of advocating for renaming it to something else?
** similar to renaming of sports teams that have indigenous people based names that are unrelated, e.g. Washington Red Skins, Cleveland Indians

* What do name products like X-Ray, Parse This, mf2util that restructure mf2 into a simpler representation for use in things like Microsub

** Parse This, for example
*** Finds the Representative Item
*** Finds the Representative author

* [[JSON Feed]] as a community spec?
** https://gist.githubusercontent.com/manton/7a8e4a7cd295dc2e2bc2dd4afa30583d/raw/6b8ca0ca670b3008f4c0900baeef86b1b80f6ba4/jsonfeed_indieweb.md - Would like to discuss this idea of sponsoring protocols
** If enough people in the community agree we should adopt JSONFeed as a community spec...given the opportunity for feedback against, we should.
** Can we add a vote to the /JSONFeed page for people's +1/0/-1?

* Importance of page speed and website performance?
** (sorry we didn't get to this topic this week, perhaps next?)
