What is the difference between /appearances vs. a bibliography
** [[appearances]]

If someone has published lots of things, should they go on multiple pages?
* https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/fullcv.pdf (Geoffrey Hinton's CV - 44 pages)
* Organize using an inverted pyramid structure?
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)
* The IndieWeb wiki often breaks out big pages into smaller ones

Consider the design principle of progressive disclosure as well

What's the difference between a lexicon and a glossary

Very long word: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Protologisms/Long_words/Titin#Noun
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin
* "However, lexicographers regard generic names of chemical compounds as verbal formulae rather than English words"

Glossary vs references:
* https://tantek.com/2023/037/t1/post-glossary

Very long place name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanfairpwllgwyngyll -
Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch

Very long Hawaiian word — the state fish: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humuhumunukunukuapua'a

Follow Wikipedia practice if an IndieWeb wiki guideline is unspecified is a good rule of thumb.

Out of context: "is the hatnote not more meta [than a headnote]"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hatnote

How about HWCs? Is that speaking? no, because it's not a talk, it's a gathering. would make more sense on an attending or rsvps page, e.g. https://aaronparecki.com/rsvps

{{t}} created [[rsvps-page]] with example of {{aaronpk}}'s /rsvps page

How should we create/name articles on the IndieWeb wiki that are about IndieWeb topics directly vs meta/about the IndieWeb community or wiki itself?

Suggestion by {{t}}:
* use "plain names" for articles about IndieWeb topics directly.
* use "indieweb-*" names for articles about the IndieWeb community or wiki itself
** e.g. [[indieweb-elsewhere]]

Thoughts / opinions?
