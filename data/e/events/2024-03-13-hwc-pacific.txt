=== Demos ===
{{gRegor}}: added lists for movies and TV shows to-watch/watched
* https://gregorlove.com/lists/movies/
* https://gregorlove.com/lists/tv/
* manually maintained, using <code><nowiki><cite class="h-cite"></nowiki></code>  parsed result: https://pin13.net/mf2/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgregorlove.com%2Flists%2Fmovies%2F
* experimenting with a rating scale: üòç loved and highly recommend it, üòÄ liked it, üòê ok/neutral, üò¶ didn‚Äôt like it
** h/t to {{tantek}} for the simplified +1, 0, -1 rating. I think of my "loved it" rating as a +2, kind of similar to [[Netflix]]'s double thumbs up
* [[watch]]
* [[review|reviews]] and [[rating|ratings]]
* what's the best scale to use?
* what's a "middle" score and what does it mean?
* different rating scales
** tomatoes on https://www.rottentomatoes.com/
** Pinnochios on Washington Post Fact Checker: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/about-fact-checker/
** "pants on fire" https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/list/?ruling=pants-fire

{{tracydurnell}} set up a page to collect resources: 
* https://tracydurnell.com/resources/graphic-design-resources/

{{artlung}} added guestbook https://artlung.com/guestbook/
* added blogroll page with view exportable opml https://artlung.com/blogroll/
* I also included a script to run against the WordPress Links database to autodiscover RSS or Atom if it is marked up

GIF pronunciation:
* {{gRegor}}: my favorite "ZHAIF" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmqy-Sp0txY

=== RSS/Atom feeds ===
* {{gRegor}} uses https://granary.io to generate Atom feeds dynamically from the microformats2
** E.g. https://gregorlove.com/stream/feed.atom redirects to granary to handle it
*{{aciccarello}} uses [[11ty]] to generate his atom/RSS feed ([https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/blob/main/_layouts/atom.xml.liquid template code])
* and once it exists, you can validate it using https://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/ or if Atom https://www.feedvalidator.org/ 

=== IWC Sacramento ===
* [[Planning#Sacramento,_CA]]
* still need to firm up the dates
* {{artlung}} created [[Sacramento]] to help manifest the event this year
* several of us would be happy to promote a possible IndieWeb Camp via blog, mastodon, other social media to support {{lifeofpablo}}!

=== Popups ===

=== Webmentions ===
* Evergreen, {{schmarty}}'s post "What we talk about when we're talking about webmentions" https://martymcgui.re/2020/07/15/what-we-talk-about-when-were-talking-about-webmentions/
* Webmentions aren't explicitly tied to microformats but most IndieWeb implementations expect microformats
* [[Ghost]] has its own use of webmentions for [https://ghost.org/docs/recommendations/ recomendations that uses JSON]

[[discuss]]

=== Photos vs screenshots ===
* {{aciccarello}} is backfilling twitter posts but wants to keep his photo gallery focused on quality photos
* what's the best way to distinguish which photos to feature in a gallery, e.g. skipping [[screenshot]]s

{{lifeofpablo}} updated his book section (WIP) https://lifeofpablo.com/lists/books

=== AI ===
* Could have a popup about AI
* [[robots_txt]] has some good examples of blocking some "AI" bots

=== IndieWeb Forums ===
* https://www.indieforums.net/ would be interesting to try out (archived?)
* It does feel like there is a space between chat and wiki for getting feedback
* {{benji}} notes that the wiki isn't great at iliciting feedback/responses
* A forum would help highlight recent posts without needing to be realtime
* Many of us follow the wiki changes (either via #meta or RSS) for changes
* We want to make sure our community is welcoming to people just getting started with a website
* Community moderation/culture would be key
* Yes spam is a concern but could be addressed in the future if it happens
* We would need someone to step up and take ownership
* Several of us are curious about how it would work but not sure
* Moderators would need to encourage the culture that we want (welcoming, on-topic, etc)
* What forum software would we want? Discourse?
* Recommendations feel easier to get in chat (or potentially a forum) than the wiki
* The wiki could provide better recommendations if organized well
* Some recommendations get spread across different pages; Do IndieWeb examples for domain providers go on the domain provider list page or the domain provider itself?
* https://discourse.32bit.cafe/ as an example forum
* Many people are afraid to edit the wiki
* {{aciccarello}} finds wiki editing takes time and some page structure conventions aren't well defined
* We could expand the wiki style guide
* With so much content on the wiki, sometimes it feels like adding stuff is adding more noise
* With most changes in the community, it requires someone to take initiative & ownership (e.g. Paul Robert Lloyd updating the wiki styles)
