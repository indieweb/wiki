* The ways to make yourself write more
** I will only write until I finish this flat wine
** Just write for 5 minues, you can always edit later
** Write on the train
** Write, where there is no stable internet connection
** Treat a blog like the dreams (it does not needs to make sense)
** One could do collection of links - on the monthly basis, that is still 12 posts per year
** https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/autonomy-online-indieweb/ includes an image that tries to clarify how different websites can communicate with each other using webmentions.
