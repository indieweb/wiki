{{artlung}}
I've gone through and updated an older aspect of my site - "blog headers" - I've been creating them since 2001 and I went through and updated them to NOT use tables and spacer gifs and other old (and not-working) markup https://artlung.com/blog/2024/01/09/modernizing-2004-web-design-to-2024/
* Headers themselves: https://artlung.com/headers/-20240103
* Codepen Collection of (most) of them in their final form: https://codepen.io/collection/xKmBxb

* Authorship
** [[authorship]]
** [[authorship-spec]]
** [[rel-author]]

* Making interactive posts https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/interactives/picotron
* https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/discussions/617#discussioncomment-467698
* {{lifeofpablo}} my solution for rich content in a blog post or element is to encapsulate it as much as possible into a chunk of markup. For example: https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/LYaZRwV - all the CSS and JS is integrated. No script tags, no external dependencies. 

Markdown?
* {{t}} is more of a markdown=0 kinda person

What do people think of the whole "Make the IndieWeb easier?" topic being posted about?
I created a page to capture the vibe:
* [[easier]]
* A lot of existing to start websites are confusing / difficult / expensive
* Growing trend toward fun / small communities like https://micro.blog and https://omg.lol.
* Maybe a non-profit equivalent of SquareSpace - there's a long list of orgs that provided free websites that scaled but could not make it work or degraded - diaryland, xanga, livejournal. There's definitely opportunity for my {{artlung}} outlandish non-profit idea.

{{chewie}} - sorry, zoom seems to be eating my battery, so I'll have to log off soon. Hopefully I will join properly next time :) Thanks everyone! :)

* image maps vs css solution
** https://dead.garden/blog/interactive-guide-of-my-jacket.html (image map)
** Jo, how did you determine the coordinates of each item? - James

About image maps - I was wrong - at some point in the last 10 years flcikr put back the mapped image annotations: e.g. https://www.flickr.com/photos/artlung/21367316/ - but it appears that new annotations cannot be added

* Replies
** https://jacky.wtf/2024/1/_p7v
** Maybe Remy Sharp's "No more 404" is handy here? https://remysharp.com/2023/09/26/no-more-404

* Question: when doing reply-to's do any publishers store a copy of the reply context as part of that reply process to reduce the dependency burden -- beyond using Internet Archive to see what an old site said?
** Long term storage: Amazon S3
** Long term backup which doesn't need frequent access https://aws.amazon.com/pm/s3-glacier/ is cheaper
** {{angelo}} I wonder if [[backup]] could use a section on caching content one encounters -- or maybe there's a better term for stashing a copy for a reply context, or just to stash a copy of something that might be ephemeral
