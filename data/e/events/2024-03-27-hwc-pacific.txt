* Considering using date ranges for copyright notices based on post data rather than just using the current date
* It probably doesn't matter
* Copyright is hard to understand: You don't normally need to register, but when DO you register?
* Sharing photos from another site/book is usually not allowed but sometimes is (icons? book covers?)
