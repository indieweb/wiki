Anti-spam on forms
* Making comments section with basic HTML form markup; Netlify serverless functions; and Supabase/Supabase.js: https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2024/01/do-read-the-comments/
* Talking of Captchas: https://doom-captcha.vercel.app/
* {{gRegor}} I've had some success with a honeypot hidden text field with a name like "website2", and checking when the form is submitted that the field is empty; if it's not, discard it as spam. Humans should never see it/fill it out, but a good chunk of bots will try to fill it in.
* Using the page's title, like this: https://zacharykai.net/lists/oceania

* "Our personal websites are not an emergency service" - Ana

* [[database-antipattern:]] definitely a plurality when it comes to db vs flat file usage in the community, no one "right answer" but tradeoffs
* {{gRegor}}: Wait, Excel isn't a database? ;)
* Baked data architectural pattern: https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/ - and related: http://datasette.io/. I wonder if anyone has done indieweb stuff with datasette, it would be well suited for at least some of it.

* https://jamesg.blog is also in rural Scotland, Amelie (thanks!)
* Internet on Legs, Captain Wikipedia, Burning Man (<-- questionable nicknames people have been called. BTW even though the festival is "Burning Man", I was getting called "Burningman", one word, very clearly.)

* {{gRegor}}: I liked this blog post by Dan Sinker about generative AI, creativity, and caring: https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/
** ‚ÄúIn the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care. In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it.‚Äù

{{angelo}} demo of page showing received webmentions:
* https://ragt.ag/mentions
* {{gRegor}} has a similar page, parsing microformats to show names/avatars: https://gregorlove.com/responses/

* {{artlung}} created a page to describe that accepting webmentions can be as minimal as having an endpoint link tag https://lab.artlung.com/webmentions/

Re: Webmention the specification vs the expected user experience, {{schmarty}} had a good post:
* https://martymcgui.re/2020/07/15/what-we-talk-about-when-were-talking-about-webmentions/

* https://artlung.com/blog/2005/08/02/mr-roth-caricature-1987/ is my favorite example of a long lived page with infrequent interactions. 

* We must all decide what to *do* with the webmentions we receive? Are they displayed or not? Are there counts of interactions or not? Every site owner can decide how to handle!
