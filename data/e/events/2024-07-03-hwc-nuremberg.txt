We were happy to host 25 people for this special event, the biggest attendance of HWC Nuremberg ever.
After a short intro talk by Tilman {{bjoern}} gave a talk about the history of IndieWeb and how the idea of HWC was born. This was followed by a presentation on how to start a website, again by Tilman.

As we wrap-up there was a lot of discussion among all participants. Next week HWC Nuremberg will take place on its normal schedule and we hope many of those who were there on this day will join then, too. We had a blast!

All resources are gathered in the [https://tilman.me/post/homebrew-website-club-nurnberg-digital/ blog post about the event] by Tilman.
