* Paul added a text fragments to a quotation on a recent blog post (https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/link-dump-feb-2025)
** Links say "View in context" and link directly to the part of a page that Paul has quoted
** Substack seems to override HTML fragments / highlights in Firefox; the behaviour is inconsistent across browsers.

* Projects in the IndieWeb org on GitHub
** Usually projects are moved if it is collaborative and has community adoption
** We encourage people to start a project in their own GitHub / GitLab / code forge / website.
** We also encourage people to look at existing projects to see what can be improved!

* Starting collaborative projects
** Create a repo, start with a statement of intent of what you want to build / your vision
** Share with others who may be interested!

* Jump into a new project!

* See "Aug 25, 1991"

* A new slashpage - for pizza - https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/pizza
** Now I would like a pizza

* Finding motivation to start new projects
** A project you are thinking about for a while may be a good sign you want to make it
** Setting a direction for yourself -- "I want to walk that way; let's start figuring out things that are involved and the steps I can take."
** inspiration that strikes late at night and won't let you go
** Starting small and building something for yourself.
** If you have an end goal it is easy to tie yourself into the goal and lose track of what it is you wanted to accomplish.
** Don't focus on the bridge five steps away when walking through the forest; focus on what's in front of you -- the immediate thing.
** No premature optimisations.
** You could focus on approaching projects that you can do in a day.
** Working on something when the idea comes, even if it's late at night.

“Reminder for the web devs out there: if you can make a website, you can make a webgame
All of the 2D stuff on my site just uses ordinary HTML/CSS/JS, eg the items in Styscraper are DIVs with background images, there's no framework or special renderer. Browsers are a lot faster nowadays!”

* "analysis paralysis"

* https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/epistolary
* "epistemology" - The Ada Palmer book I recommended is at least partly about epistemology
** Seeing that I made a typo made me laugh :D
* We used two words that start with "epist-"!
* Also epistolary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistolary_novel

* Layers in software development: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
* When you build software, you could create an API for someone to use or make a UI that people can use
* Frameworks take time to learn

* Binary Cmdlets for script-component interoperability: https://github.com/carrvo/BinaryCmdlet-Demos
* Interactive webserver in PowerShell: https://github.com/carrvo/WebHost/blob/master/PowerShellHttpModule/README.md

* What we're planning to do for the next week
** Writing on our websites
** Adding features to https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/cutup/text-mixing-desk
** {{artlung}} Updating MathML page on artlung lab https://lab.artlung.com/mathml/
** After posting to Bluesky, Kevin shared https://www.kevinmarks.com/htmlversustex
** Adding portfolio content to our websites

* Live updating pages
** The page updates if the content on the server has changed
** https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ updates live
*** Uses the background notification API in the browser?

* Pattern: read structured text (i.e. from a wiki) and create a new representation of it.
** https://artlung.com/indieweb/ as an example

* world cafe chat on IRC in internet cafes in 1994/95
* the magic of getting an interaction from somebody who is across the planet
** there is a lot to explore here from a deliberate design perspective
** mental health and joyful experiences should be core considerations in tool design

Notifications
* [[push_notification#Distraction]]
* we (IndieWeb) can focus on mental health and more joyful experiences, rather than services who want to just get your time in front of their app or your passive surveillance data

* what  {{jo}} did on their website during the call: https://dead.garden/art/posts/baranosoretsu.html

* "why is social media not fun anymore?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwIYwsONFes

* {{benji}} is working on an RSS feed for the IndieWeb Movie Club and IndieWeb Carnival
** Has a demo working on localhost right now
** Building websites that interpret raw data and add functionality, etc.

* "mashup" web concept
* "make stuff out of the web"
** Open data
** Having a personal website where you talk to the world is valuable

* https://jamesg.blog/hwc-notes
* https://indiewebforum.eu/

* Communicating URLs to people; the joy of being able to say "go to artlung.com/books" for example that lists the books you looked at.
** WordPress auto-redirects (like http://artlung.com/pizza)
** Being able to open your website to answer a question
*** Others may look something up in their notes; we can look things up on our websites.
*** People IRL may not be interested in your website, but it's still useful to one's self.
*** Digital gardening is related to the idea of all the slash pages we have been talking about.

* RSS is something that younger people don't really know about
** We shouldn't let that get lost!
** Podcasts is a good context -- you don't need to subscribe via Spotify, etc.; you can download the mp4/mp3.
** Many email clients support RSS, like Outlook.
* Sites that support RSS/Atom
** YouTube
** Reddit
** GitHub
** Tumblr
** BlueSky
** Mastodon
** Many news sites have RSS support
* Eric M showed off https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awesome-rss/ at [[Front End Study Hall #022|events/2025-02-25-front-end-study-hall]]
** Unrelated to RSS I learned more about LaTeX yesterday and I added to https://lab.artlung.com/mathml/ with some of what I learned yesterday.

* https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-subscriber-count/
* "Web-headedness"

* A reader could broadcast the number of subscribers on a reader
** This could be done in a user agent

Scraping various home pages for lists of links to turn into a feed - good or bad idea?
* Inoreader has a feature that lets you manually create a feed for a page if one isn't found
* js;dr may be a problem
* Links may be wrapped (like the ones on https://news.google.com/home?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB:en)
* There may be a social media account with RSS support (i.e. Mastodon) for a website that doesn't have an RSS feed

* Instagram is hostile to the web.
** There are many features that are technically possible that Instagram disables / doesn't offer (no feeds, etc.); the reason why many open web technologies are not embraced is because it's not in their interest.
** The IG app supports DMs
** Q: Can you bookmark the URL that lists your most recent DMs?
** Q: Can you bookmark deep links to chats?
** "Why is Instagram limited in annoying ways?": answering this question in a way that gets people thinking about the nature of social networks.

* How can we help the younger generation learn more about RSS / open web standards?

* Send people to indieweb.org if they are tired of the status quo :D

* Not everyone has the tools that we all have.
* Experiences of using Google Drive because we have to for a collaborative project, not because we want to; there being few intuitive experiences.
* Assumptions that someone uses a tool (i.e. asking for someone's IG account to exchange contact info, asking someone to write in a Google Doc who doesn't have an account / doesn't want to use the service).

* Complexities of installing Etherpad.
* "@abc" doesn't include the context of the service that someone uses (did the author assume that someone would look tem up on IG?); what if the author doesn't have the same handle on all services. As more social medias pop up, it is hard to guarantee you can use the same name.

* Configuration as a way for someone to design a solution toward their needs.
** Software that can do many things can do the one thing someone wants.
