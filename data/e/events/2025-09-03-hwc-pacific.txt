IndieAuth discussion
* For benji, maybe this helps? https://stackoverflow.com/a/79396769 tl;dr could encrypt the code_challenge in the authorization_code that you send back. Couldn't use JWT in that case, probably.
* From dev chat, memcache or database suggested https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2025-09-04#t1756956646012800
* Aaron chimed in: "You can also use an encrypted JWT to store stuff. So if your authorization code is actually an encrypted JWT you can store the PKCE code challenge in it to be able to verify later. It's important that it's encrypted not just signed tho"
