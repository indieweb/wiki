'''<dfn>[https://events.indieweb.org/2024/07/homebrew-website-club-nuremberg-germany-mSA17SBkPqdw Homebrew Website Club N체rnberg]</dfn>''' was an IndieWeb meetup in real life that took place on 2024-07-10.
We were once again very happy to be hosted by [https://leonardo-zentrum.de/ LEONARDO - Zentrum f체r Kreativit채t und Innovation].

== Participants ==
* {{bjoern}} - https://bjoern.stierand.org
* Sebastian Feldmann - https://make.sfeld.eu
* Tilman Zitzmann - https://tilman.me
* Max H채sslein - https://www.maxhaesslein.de/

== Notes ==

We hoped that some participants of [[events/2024-07-03-hwc-nuremberg|last weeks event]] would show up today, but in the end it just the usual crew was present. We even forgot to take a picture this time. :(

{{bjoern}} took the chance to improve his website layout using some CSS tips from Max. While Sebastian tried to create an animated image (like {{julieannenoying}} used to do) from last weeks content, were Max and Tilman busy to fix some IndieAuth issues on Tilmans website.

We got some stuff done in the end, enjoyed each others company and look forward to the August meeting.
