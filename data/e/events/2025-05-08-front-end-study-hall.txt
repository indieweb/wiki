== Joe's Zoom Background Today ==
* Joe's background today: jQuery https://web.archive.org/web/20060209035517/http://jquery.com:80/
** Developed by John Resig ... launched with a website, blog, mailing list, and plugin architecture
** jQuery made writing JavaScript more accessible to amatuer programmers
** Used CSS selectors as a means to choose and manipulate items on a page
** Still in wide use, still in development
** Influenced CSS development... and CSS development influenced jQuery's development https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style//2008Oct/0065.html
** Introduced a fluent "chained" programming style
*** $("p.surprise").addClass("ohmy").show("slow");
```
document.querySelectorAll('p.surprise').forEach(function(element) {
     element.classList.add('ohmy');
     element.style.display = 'block';
     element.style.transition = 'all 0.5s ease-in-out';
     element.style.opacity = '1';
});
```
* Eric M: :has() date back to the late 1990s, first widespread implementation of has in jQuery
* Browsers got bettter, efficiency
* "Someone had to do it natively and performantly" (adblocker company hired ogalia to try it)
* querySelectorAll, whole lotta the DOM came from the jQuery

* site on how modern browser APIs do what jquery used to https://github.com/you-dont-need-x/you-dont-need-jquery


== Changes made to web pages this week ==
Michael text shadows removed - largest
Pagespeed performance
Largest contentful paint - PageSpeed
Fancy 12-14 text-shadows
Firefox - to play with the styles

* Joe made a header with a picture element and multiple image ediutions rather than use a Png - 3 light, 3 dark based on user preference and min-width

* https://ryelle.codes/2025/04/typography-troubles-balancing-in-japanese-korean/ nuance for Japanese and Korean text-balance

* hyphenation breaks
* text-wrap: balance vs pretty
** https://adactio.com/journal/21896 
** Something I’m reaching for now is the text-wrap property with its new values of pretty and balance:
ul,ol,dl,dt,dd,p,figure,blockquote {
  hanging-punctuation: first last;
  text-wrap: pretty;
}
And maybe this for headings, if they’re being centred:
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
  text-align: center;
  text-wrap: balance;
}
* we need a better term for "widows and orphans" - words hanging after a headline

This is Reilly: Wi-Fi is down, phone hotspot isn't fast enough to connect to Zoom audio

* Joe has breaks on a tags on home page, text-wrap balance may help on a parent element helps
* problem was pulled in html whioch included very long http links and would cause elements to be too wide


* xhtml - anchors on anything
* html5 - anchors can surround anything and be valid! Blame Eric M!

* MichaelKupietz Page appearance - color modifiucations - color calculations in javascript, used jQuery

* New pope chosen

* ligature - font-variant-ligatures https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-ligatures
