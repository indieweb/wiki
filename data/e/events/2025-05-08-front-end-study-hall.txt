== Joe's Zoom Background Today ==
*  '''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209035517/http://jquery.com:80/ jQuery website], 2006'''
** Developed by John Resig, launched with a website, blog, mailing list, and plugin architecture
** jQuery made writing JavaScript more accessible to amatuer programmers
** Used CSS selectors as a means to choose and manipulate items on a page
** Still very popular library deployed on the web 19 years later. Still in active development [https://jquery.com/ jquery.com]
** Influenced CSS development and improvements; and CSS development influenced jQuery's development (here's [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style//2008Oct/0065.html discussion of CSS selector implementation on www-style mailing list, 2008].
** Introduced a fluent "chained" programming style
*** Example code: 

<pre>$("p.surprise").addClass("ohmy").show("slow");
</pre>

*** In vanilla JS today:
<pre>document.querySelectorAll('p.surprise')
 .forEach(function(element) {
  element.classList.add('ohmy');
  element.style.display = 'block';
  element.style.opacity = '1';
});</pre>
* {{artlung}} posits that we have <code>:has()</code> today because it was implemented in jQuery
* Eric M: <code>:has()</code> date back to the late 1990s, ''although'' the first widespread implementation of <code>:has()</code> may have been in jQuery
* Browsers got better, more efficiently
* "Someone had to do it natively and performantly" (adblocker company hired ogalia to implement has ad proved it could work to the other browser makers)
* We would not have gotten <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code>; we got a whole lot of DOM tools from jQuery
* Notes on how modern browser APIs do what jQuery used to: '''[https://github.com/you-dont-need-x/you-dont-need-jquery You Don't Need jQuery]
* ''See also'' [[jQuery]]

== Grab Bag of Topics ==
=== Text Shadow Performance ===
* {{kupietz}} removed multiple text shadows from home page
** working on improving Google PageSpeed 
** Largest contentful paint - PageSpeed
** was: Fancy 12-14 text-shadows
** Using Firefox - to toggle the styles to see results

=== PNG with Alpha vs light JPG / dark JPG ===
* {{artlung}} Joe made [https://artlung.com/headers/-20250507 a header] with a <picture> element and multiple image editions to avoid a heavy PNG which could do alpha to support light and dark backgrounds - multiple jpeg images with black or white backgrounds were lighter.

=== Color Modifications ===
* [https://webkit.org/blog/16900/p3-and-alpha-color-pickers/ Webkit is shipping] <code><input type=color alpha></code>
* Will also store color using the native color space ''(not reset to srgb)''
* {{kupietz}} has a tool to play with his colors on hit site
* does not use oklch

=== Pope Note 1 ===
* Announced during meeting: '''Habemus papam! And he's American'''

=== Joe Blogged about CSS Battle and FrESH ===
* ''[https://artlung.com/blog/2025/05/06/110-css-battle/ 110 Hours of CSS Battle]''
* ''[https://artlung.com/blog/2025/04/25/study-hall-reflections/ Study Hall Reflections]''

=== Trek ===
* Eric's background? ''Star Trek: TOS''
* LCARS (from ''ST: TNG'') [https://www.thelcars.com thelcars]
* Dan Hon has done some design with LCARS
* Joe attended Dan Hon's Hallway Track ''[https://www.verylittlegravitas.com/hallwaytrack#:~:text=006%20Star%20Trek%20and%20Design 006 Star Trek and Design]'' in January 2024
* In other venues, Mike will happily argue you into the ground that [https://michaelkupietz.com/writing/ideas-perspectives/reviews-cultural-reportage/picard-janeway-star-trek-fandom-fundamentals/ TNG is not Star Trek] 

=== List Item Icon Taking Too Much Memory? ===
* Why are the icons used on the unordered list sometimes registering as taking lots of in-page memory?
* Links page: https://vanderwal.net/links.php
** Caching troubles?
** Not sure if we're replicating the issue
** icon ends up taking more memory? 
** ''Later'', Joe took a stab redoing the icons as <code>conic-gradient()</code> https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/JooaJoK

=== Speaking of Popes, ''Typography!'' ===

* [https://www.ncronline.org/opinion/guest-voices/typographers-react-pope-francis-botched-memorial Typographers react to Pope Francis' botched memorial] (Kerning mishap)

=== Nuance with text-wrap: balance and non-English languages ===
* https://ryelle.codes/2025/04/typography-troubles-balancing-in-japanese-korean/ nuance for Japanese and Korean text-balance
* hyphenation breaks
* <code>text-wrap: balance</code> vs <code>pretty</code>
** https://adactio.com/journal/21896 
** Something I’m reaching for now is the text-wrap property with its new values of pretty and balance:
<pre>
ul,ol,dl,dt,dd,p,figure,blockquote {
  hanging-punctuation: first last;
  text-wrap: pretty;
}
/** And maybe this for headings, 
  * if they’re being centred: */
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
  text-align: center;
  text-wrap: balance;
}
</pre>
* we need a better term for "widows and orphans" - words hanging after a headline

''This is Reilly: Wi-Fi is down, phone hotspot isn't fast enough to connect to Zoom audio''

* Joe has breaks on a <A> tags on home page to force long urls in-line from blowing out elements with a finite width

<pre>
main ul li:has(p) a {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  word-break: break-all;
}
</pre>
** implemeted because pulled in html which included very long http links and would cause elements to be too wide
** <code>text-wrap: balance</code> suggestion on a parent element ''(it works!)''

=== On Linking every element, <a> around larger content ===

* xhtml - allowed anchors on anything
* html5 - anchors can surround anything and be valid!
** Blame Eric M!

* MichaelKupietz showed off https://michaelkupietz.com Page appearance - color modifications - color calculations in javascript, used jQuery

* Michael also encountered problems with an uploaded html resume getting words wrong because of misinterpreted ligatures (maybe in OCR?)
* maybe ligatures could be controlled with <code>font-variant-ligatures</code> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-ligatures

=== Reilly's goal: non JS hierarchical nav menu ===
* Reilly's CSS only menu: https://reillyspitzfaden.com/
* uses <code>pointer-events: none</code> in some states
* hidden checkbox?

* TIL about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within

* https://moderncss.dev/css-only-accessible-dropdown-navigation-menu/ 
** https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/
** https://melsumner.github.io/details-as-a-menu 

==== Joe wants to work on this ====
* NAV MENU:
** WORK ON MOBILE
** TABS SHOULD WORK TO EXPOSE EVERY NAVIGABLE PART OF MENU
** ACCESSIBLE
** NO JAVASCRIPT
** ARROW KEYS (STRETCH GOAL)

=== <code>calc(infinity)</code>''! and beyond!'' ===
* calc(infinity)
* to set maximum z-index?
* or to set a maximum text-indent or margin-left to push things off screen?

* dropdown typeahead Kevin
* One place to look for thoughtful menu code would be https://projects.verou.me/awesomplete/

=== Thanks for coming! ===
Got to go now; thanks everyone
