It's great to start with just plain HTML and worry about automating or tooling later. The principle is called "manual until it hurts": [[manual_until_it_hurts]]

Safer curl one-liners e.g.: 
<pre>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash</pre>
