PESOS vs POSSE
both have advantages for reactions

=== Reposts ===
* Republish UI example: https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors
* Repost challenges, people not liking their content getting reposted
* If you support reposts, you must clearly show that the content is both written by someone else, and from someone else. If you "just" make it look like a note then it will misrepresent the content as if you wrote it, which is both not true, and looks like plagiarizing the original author
