Bridgy Fed
* {{gRegor}} set up [[Bridgy Fed]] with gregorlove.com this past week.
** Set up a redirect in .htaccess similar to https://tantek.com/2022/301/t1/twittermigration-bridgyfed-mastodon-indieweb
** create a note, put https://fed.brid.gy/ in the syndication links temporarily, send a webmention, Bridgy Fed picks up the post and does all the Mastodon/ActivityPub magic. Afterward I remove the syndication link (manual until it hurts!). I've received replies and reposts, even:
** https://gregorlove.com/2022/11/to-toot-or-not-to-toot/
