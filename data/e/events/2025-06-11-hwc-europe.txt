== Notes ==
* Question of the day: "What two different html tags are your favorite?"
** {{kupietz}} details > summary or html > body
** {{reillypascal}} article > section
** {{lazcorp}} body > main
** {{mandaris}} figure > figcaption and blockquote > footer (Example: https://mandarismoore.com/2025/04/28/looks-like-the-mcrib-is.html)
** {{alabut}}: dl > dt > dd
** {{zachary.kai}} details > summary
** {{vanderwal}} I really like the DL stace of markup, but also blockquote with cite
** {{gRegor}}: blink and marquee. or if we're talking politics, del
** {{nsmsn}}: small and &amp;nbsp; (even though that's not a tag.)
** {{artlung}} fav tag is nobr but as a pair of tags, I think I like figure > figcaption

== RIP ==
* Brian Wilson (joe's Beach Boys mix: [https://artlung.com/mixtapes/beachboysessence Beachboysessence]
* Sly Stone (No webpage, but somewhere, ''there's a midget standing tall, and a giant beside him about to fall'' (lyrics from ''Stand'')
*** Strong recommendation for Questlove's recent documentary ''Sly Lives!''

== Al's Updates ==
* {{alabut}} has still been putting up simple single use pages for bikepacking
** Latest is a training log from the first ride into the mountains: http://alabut.com/projects/bikepacking/ridelog1/
** The first was last week and an overview of the route: https://alabut.com/projects/bikepacking/
** Both are based on my skeleton starter template: http://alabut.com/projects/halfnaked/
** I've also been working on my first blog post in a year but wow is it hard to get the rust off of the writing skills. I found I still have the ear for what I want to put out, it's just taking longer to hammer a draft into a final polished edit.

* My recent favorite tags are <picture> and <source> for making responsive images, as I demo and document here: https://alabut.com/drafts/

* My old school favorite html tags are a description list: <nowiki>dl> <dt> <dt></nowiki>
** https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp
** https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dt.asp
** https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dd.asp

== Also ==
* Zachary has audio again yah!

* Speaking of definition lists as code for a script: I have a small text to definition list tool on the lab: https://lab.artlung.com/quote-to-dl/

== ChatGPT, accuracy, etc ==

https://chatgpt.com/share/6849c796-3278-800a-b483-5b20b31a8566

* Ana Tudor recently shared a solid article about the shortcomings of ChatGPT for coding solutions: https://frontendmasters.com/blog/chatgpt-and-old-and-broken-code/
* There's a longer published paper by Apple on the limits of the reasoning abilities of LLM's: https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking
* Artificial Incompetence (AI) will replace human incompetence by 2029

* Baldur Bjarnason's recent piece:
** https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2025/trusting-your-own-judgement-on-ai/
** https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/ 
* https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-knockout-blow-for-llms

* What is your policy or preference for using A.I. tools in your writing?
** {{alabut}} has a "anything except the writing itself" approach, where the chatbot can help with information or feedback, but don't ever write any prose whatsoever.
** {{mandaris}} says he avoids A.I. because of the risks of deskilling:

** https://laetitiaatwork.substack.com/p/ais-battle-of-the-skills-upskilling

* Chicago Sun-Times confirms AI was used to create reading list of books that don’t exist
** https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/chicago-sun-times-ai-summer-reading-list

* One of the reasons to be wary of using A.I. tool replace or even aid creativity is that the tired cliche aesthetic of the look of A.I. generated visuals and writing:
** https://www.fastcompany.com/91001568/one-year-in-the-gen-ai-aesthetic-is-already-a-tired-trope
** Showed examples of physical posters that have the same generic look
    
* {{artlung}} "A.I. is mid"
** https://www.buchman.co.il/readings/opinion__actually_ai_is_pretty_mid_-_the_new_york_times/

* https://reillyspitzfaden.com/ai-policy/
* Nice! Consider adding to [[large_language_model#IndieWeb_Examples]] if you'd like

* GenAI is Our Polyester: https://culture.ghost.io/genai-is-our-polyester/

* Making things "rough" can also have practical benefits in quickly expressing authenticity and handcrafted.

== Art! ==
* Procedural art for what was once called generative art
** "vibe code" is that coding?
** access to ai enshittification
** how to change the verbs?
** 
** Produce vs create as verb? (making distinction as to where the credit goes?) Kupietz uses "generate".

* Question for the group: Are these art? https://michaelkupietz.com/wild-california-studies/ How about these? https://michaelkupietz.com/a-helluva-band/ How about these? https://michaelkupietz.com/gray-ponytails/ These? https://michaelkupietz.com/drooling-ai-assisted-lyrical-illumination/ Who is the author of those images: a machine, or me?
** Answer to {{kupietz}} from {{lazcorp}} (without looking at your URLs):
I'm answering this as someone who graduated with a degree in fine art in 1992, who has been a practicing artist since then:
Yes, they're art. Art is anything presented as art. I say "presented" because not all art is created to be art (a good example being Duchamp's Urinal - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp) ). 
One problem with the term "art" is that, in colloquial English, it has underlying connotations of quality, but I think those connotations are misleading.
A 3-year-old child's drawing is as much art as <insert painting by famous renaissance artist here>. Art is a purpose, not a label of quality.
To answer "who is the author of those images" I'd again refer to Duchamp's Urinal - is Duchamp the _creator_ of the Urinal (no, he found it - it's Found Object art), but he is the artist who presented it as art.
Hope that helps. Thanks for the reply {{lazcorp}}! A lot started with Urinal (and LHOOQ)... when I was in electronic music (before the current Techno age, when it was more in the classical realm) Duchamp was where the History Of Electronic Music classes started, before proceeding to music concréte (yes, the accent is wrong, I can't find the right one) and Pierre Schaeffer. Anyway, I was more interested in a response, not in terms of broad questions of what is art (about which I can pontificate for hours and you and I would probably agree on a lot of points), but whether those people who seem to think AI text-to-image outputs "all look similar" or are "enshittifying" art, or that it's the AI doing the creative work and not the prompt author, find those specific galleries to have any human artistic merit or not, on a more visceral, personal, than philosophical level. I'm not trying to inquire what art is, so much as where people's personal boundaries are.

* There's a generational difference in how most people use ai: https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/articles/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-163151359.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIGkTX03CZbHNHhSF00SbcW25zP1-Cvuj3dgYLjzuaR-k1-zPkHjAcr3kAXMOeLr622EyX-M1_UOJ26nKTYkaVpJzfph-59-D1WB7ZqnxSrVVbfi2jPcaLNuu5uU-Oq-prpOKTRXv2B4ODalaz6eDieTTkmT14L0Fms5VjwWrrkt

I wish I had a chance to comment on how expertise plays into trusting AI content

== Google Sheets as web page source ==

For {{alabut}}: https://tinysubversions.com/projects/ runs off of a Google Sheet
* [[Google_Sheets]]
** {{artlung}}'s https://artlung.com/robots/ page is driven from a Google spreadsheet

== Video in RSS ==
* ((alabut}} asked about how to add video to posts in a way that shows up in feed readers?
** {{fractalkitty}} had good advice about embedding it from a 3rd party service like Vimeo
** {{artlung}} validated concerns about using <cpde>video</code> directly tends to be stripped out in feeds and/or readers, but tends to see embedded youtube clips in posts by others within a reader.
** A good compromise: having a teaser post in the feed that says "click through to view the full post with math experiment or video or etc"

* FreshRSS doesn't render LaTeX by defultt but because of plugin architectures, which many self-hosted RSS readers have:   https://github.com/aledeg/xExtension-LatexSupport
