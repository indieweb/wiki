Changes on our own websites are slow because of the holiday season. However, some small tweaks were made.

Tilman discovered https://www.joshwcomeau.com/ and the nice animation effect of the rainbow on the top.

Max added a new feature to his photo stream at https://www.maxhaesslein.de/visual/photography/moments/2024/ so that you can scroll with your cursor keys and the current photo gets aligned in the center of the browser window. The pictures themselves get loaded by lazy-loading.

We further decided to get rid of our [[Discord]] instance and own our data at the [[Discourse]] instance Tilman set up at https://homebrew-website.club/. That's the platform HWC Nuremberg is going to use for internal communication from now on.

We also did a photo this time, yay!
