== Notes ==

=== Joe ===
* Joe is looking at his mostly-old site and seeing if there's a way to modernize it https://lab.artlung.com/
** It's a site that started in 1999 or so
** Has had additions made over time
** Is a mess, could use tools to organize it
** Code is in private repo in github, take steps for accountability
*** https://github.com/artlung/lab.artlung.com now public
*** tagged the original code, download existing code, commit to repo
*** Cleanup markup - done
*** Continue using disqus  - yes
*** Allow webmentions? added to all pages
*** Make site more navigable? sort of

=== James ===
* James fixed his blog post publishing tool at https://jamesg.blog/create/

=== Reilly ===
* Reilly updated their Eleventy blog posts to use templates (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-template-dir/) for a whole directory instead of needing to specify in each post. This will hopefully make it easier to update things later on
** Also interested in displaying tags as links:
*** Found a useful discussion of this: https://community.piccalil.li/t/calling-all-eleventy-collections-automatically-in-separate-figures/275?u=mathieu-huot
*** How to paginate tag pages: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/tag-pages/
*** Done! Links are clickable and go to separate tag pages: https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2024/11/connecting-notation-programs-to-maxmsp/
* https://reillyspitzfaden.com/tags/indieweb/ the width of the content is a bit narrow
** Problem was `width: fit-content;` in CSS
* Met a stretch goal! Added search with https://pagefind.app/docs/
** Example: https://reillyspitzfaden.com/blog/

=== Tantek ===
* {{t}} did some digging into Nunjucks, and added it to the [[template]] page in a list
* apparently used by https://protocol.mozilla.org/ - design system for Mozilla websites, but open to others to use
* {{t}} found this template linter: https://www.curlylint.org/
* Had coffee with Pablo IRL during the call

=== Morgan: ===
* https://www.morganwebdev.org/urls/ - New page on my website
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API using the speculation rules script tag

=== {{gRegor}} ===
* ✔️ Got inspired by Reilly's project to finally add a tags page: https://gregorlove.com/tags/
* Included a fun bit at the top which loads a random HTML tag, then followed by the actual *post* tags you were probably looking for
* TODO: need to link up tags from individual posts
* TODO: update tag permalinks to show [[event]] posts

=== Misc ===
* COFFEE: Dont buy today, but consider buying... https://us.moccamaster.com/ I got one years ago and its served me so well

* Bellingham 2017 photos that ended up being on Star Wars Day: [[2017/Bellingham#Day_1_Photos]]

* For James: San Diego recommendations: https://www.ciccarello.me/reviews/san-diego/

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index

* https://www.sfgate.com/la/article/norms-24-hour-diner-75th-anniversary-las-vegas-18643439.php
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norms_Restaurants
* James should make a diner moodboard :D

* Example Lab Page https://lab.artlung.com/speech-synthesis/
** {{gRegor}} and {{artlung}} discovered they could hear each other activating speech synthesis through headphones though neither had shared their audio in the stream

=== Thanks for visiting! ===
* Thanks all who participated in IndieWebCreate Day, we of the IndieWeb hope to hold a similar event next year
* [https://artlung.com/images/IndieWebBlackFridayCreateDayBanner.jpg Banner for today's event], potentially reusable in 2025: 

* We cut the event short at 6 hours. 2 hours short of the 8 hour target length - but lots got done!
