Tilman gave a short introduction about the design faculty and all the options that are available to study here. This place will be our homebase for now as LEONARDO will move to a new location. Thanks Tilman (and happy birthday!).

Philip showed us some improvements he made to his website. There was a short discussion about on what point you have to make clear that you link to external content like YouTube or Facebook. Max made the point that (at least on desktop) it's obvious because of the URL hint in the browser and you don't have to make it explicit every time.

René showed his blog nugget29.com and the backend behind it he built. We also talked about the projects he showed on his website (like picoTracker).

{{bjoern}} showed his efforts to add an RSS feed to his static website. There was an error in the code that he fixed during the HWC meeting, that's why the notes are a bit sparse this time.
