== Notes ==
* Welcome! 
* https://www.htmhell.dev/ Advent Calendar! Manny shared that it's giving him joy this year
** First entry is popover 
* https://artlung.com/mixtapes/ worked on Create Day to improve it
** Has transitions from a global set of transition code - Slick!
* Manny is working on search and transitions on his Hugo-based site
* Transitions on Joe's site as of today: https://gist.github.com/artlung/b5800168c3e197e09dd664c40c36643f
* https://blue.mackuba.eu/directory/pdses Directory of PDSes
* Joe discovered a "Fediverse" tab in Threads.
* https://www.recurse.com/ Recurse Center
** community, people apply to be part of it, 6-12 week retreat where you spend full time "working at the edge of your abilities" focus on learning and exploring technology; no money either way; pitch their recruiting services; associated with Y-Combinator somewhat
** Can't find a published schedule, but some Recursers appear periodically at https://meet.jit.si/RandomWalkHaskellTalk
* [[User:Xoxo.zone_@artlung]] (lattice of trust)
* Speaking of LLMs: [[large_language_model_traffic]] is a great page. Thanks {{rossabaker}} for adding yourself to that page!
* Reed is working on a static site generator --
** [[TiddlyWiki]] it's been around a while...
** it was first popular because it all sits in a single html document, entries are called "Tiddlers" -- downloaded tiddlywiki is a single html file - it's the entirety of the wiki
** stored as html, operating system all in JavaScript
** Calling it "HTML Wiki"  - source is markdown, html
** Reed is a fan of HATEOS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS 
** All driven by the server
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/template
** Reminds me {{artlung}} somewhat of old ColdFusion server side tags
** node backend with a few layers:
*** webserver - transforms the request
*** engine which executes the templating

* Today I learned TiddlyWiki can be thought of as a quine: https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Quine.html
* Tired of the mismatch between your templates and what produces them?  Try a Lisp!
** In Scheme, Haunt is a static site generator: https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html
** The $10 word that helps with this is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity
** XSLT is at least adjacent to this concept
** Sometimes this is too powerful.  
*** Functional programming talk, but a classic: "Constraints Liberate, Liberties Constrain" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqmsQeSzMdw

* The [[indiebookclub]] year in review page has started updating daily (and mostly worked automatically from last year, woo!) https://indiebookclub.biz/review/2025

* suggestion: IndieBookClub "Shelved" EOY reports per domain

* December Adventure https://eli.li/december-adventure
** Ross is doing that and is writing a Webmention sender and receiver

* Hashing URIs for deduping.
** Extra credit: normalize them first: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6

* Can our webservers treat each other respectfully?
** Lowest bar: can we treat each other more respectfully than LLM scraper traffic?

* On checking robots.txt, and in general: does it feel like the right thing to do?
* mention of thundering herd (Mastodon preview query slashdotting, I think remediated as of this meeting) on [[microcaching]]
