== Notes ==
* Welcome to HWC!
* Music and rhythm
** Question to think about: what is the rhythm of a website?
*** Some musicians switch between instruments mid-song. What does this mean for a website?
*** What is the tempo of a website?
** Putting two-bar grooves on your website
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_harp
** https://www.youtube.com/@roberttiso
** https://jamesg.blog/search-pages?q=taylor%20swift&page=1
** Background music on your websites
** James thinks his website fits in with a classical vibe (but it was noted that Taylor Swift would be a good fit too!)
** An instrument of browser tabs
** Looking forward to writing more on our websites
*** Writing / editing being an enjoyable, therapeutic process
** Adding an edit section to posts on your website
* ... add notes
* Music fans: Go find and listen to Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of The Moon". Go. Tonight. Turn the lights off and listen to it. (Older folks: Please nobody mention "The Wizard Of Oz" here, we can discuss that after everybody's heard it normally.)
 
** Tom Stoppard's radio play DarkSide for the 40th Anniversary of the Album  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z06tu58oePA
 
** Westworld S3 also used part of DSoM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohMRfCxUKkA (piano version)
 
** Another Pink FLoyd song, with the original Jazz violin solo restored https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm4sDyCW0k8 
 
** sound design in movies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kavxsXhzD48
 
Passing parameters to SVG

* Flow comes up in a lot of places
** Music
** Communication / speech
** Design
** Typography

Csikszentmihalyi on Flow
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow
 
IndieWeb band
* The instruments we know on the call would make for an interesting band
 
What we're doing on our websites this week
* IndieAuth module for Apache (written in C)
* Putting things out there on the web
** Joe shared his mixtapes on Mastodon, someone responded with a UI that looks like a cassette; the serendipity of the web.
* Audio Control with the look of a cassette: https://sheep.horse/2025/3/a_cassette_audio_control_for_the_web.html
** {{mandaris}} still interested in integrating https://libre.fm/ 
*** And interested in reworking the search system on his website
** Experimenting with IndieAuth
*** https://indieweb.org/Vouch_Proxy
 
* Message in a Bottle is a Taylor Swift song
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle_(Taylor_Swift_song)

Talking about things you make can help you find people interested in working on something you're building
 
* https://jamesg.blog/coffee-songs
** I'm also thinking about a Garfield coffee index, definitely featuring https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/2021/07/18
 
"My website is my omnibus of everything"
* Mike's page "Mikesplaining" page on time signatures: "A Young Person's Guide To Common Time Signatures" https://michaelkupietz.com/writing/mikesplaining/young-persons-common-signatures/ (while we're at it, a little on harmonic theory: "Why are two notes an octave apart considered the same note?" https://michaelkupietz.com/writing/mikesplaining/musical-notes-octave-considered/)
 
* https://sive.rs/music
** Thinking about how our styles evolve on our websites
** You can make a web page that lists the designs you have had on your website
 
Versions of a website
- https://arielsalminen.com/faq/#:~:text=Do%20you%20have%20old%20versions%20of%20your%20website%20still%20around
* Kupietz's first-ever professional web site: https://web.archive.org/web/19980129091309/http://www.greentortoise.com:80/ (archive.org is corrupting the image map on that page, the map actually looked as it appears on the top of the next version of the site at https://web.archive.org/web/19980627072713/http://www.greentortoise.com:80/)
 
Being aware of what we share on our websites
 
* "Here’s the last 30 days." section on https://artlung.com
 
Making pages with their own, distinct layout on your website
** Can be jarring, but allows experimentation in design
** Having a common section -- like a navigation bar! -- would be useful
*** This could also be a hamburger menu in the bottom corner that is distinct from everything else on the site; works well with light-dark mode
*** Could web components be used here?
*** A marker of "Here's where you are!" (like the lowercase "i" button)
*** Loading screen between pages with an interstitial that says "And now for a new design!" :D
 
"Recapitulate"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory
"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"
Idea for an Etherpad extension: sign in with your domain name so you can persist the colour of your text
 
* KM the pie chart reminds me of my now-immortal Bip Bop test sequence https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD4emXqHCsE
 
CSS transitions API
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API
* https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions
 
Information design on websites
* Is information design more intuitive to people newer to the web because there has been so much work done?
* James observation: it would be fun to try and make an information architecture as different as possible to what exists already. (A digital garden that has a garden background and lots of images that connect things; image map navigation; what link structures could exist?)
* It's hard to make consistent navigation on an old site with lots of pages
* Experimenting with different types of content / structures can help you find one that you like
* Wikipedia proved that a flat information architecture works well for large numbers of documents
** Premature heirarchy can create a lot of overhead.
** Wikipedia has noted that language subdomains (i.e. de.wikipedia) was a mistake
*** Domains cause a need for SSO / auth cookies / lots of technical overhead
*** Showing contributions across language wikis is hard
** Sitemaps can help people find their way through a website
*** Mini maps are a spatial representation of a sitemap
*** Visual distinctions can help people remember where things are // things being in their own place on the website.
** "Related pages" section on your website
*** James is interested in doing hybrid category list / wiki pages
** How can video game design influence the information architecture of your website?
** Tantek's advice: start flat.
** I have a Digital Weedpatch

*** https://melonking.net/free/software/flood is funny :D

* "CSS is incredible!"
 
* Where the apostophe goes in the plural for James
** James's - per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James%27s
 
* James (https://jamesbrierly.com/) uses Univers font on his website
** Found via https://jero.zone/
** Considerations for testing your website: make sure the fonts work on different OSes
 
* Making your website without AI
 
* The IndieWeb being a more raw way to express yourself
** Exciting to look back in a year and see what *you* have been writing about
 
* Websites as a way to connect with people
* The personal website community is fun; you don't need to worry about follower counts. Lots of people to meet.
 
* https://lu.ma/foclondon
* https://futureofcoding.org/
 
* https://photos.jamesbrierly.com/ has a cool design feature where when you scroll the information about the photo persists.
** Philosophy is intentional design; less is more.

All the auths: authorization, authorship.
 
https://slashpages.net#nope "a list of things you don't like or don't want to do"
* https://fyr.io/nope
* A meta /nope page which only sais "No"
* And /yeah pages exist too
* /yes and /nope pages relate to the idea of site principles, like https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/21/guiding-principles-for-my-website/ and https://sarajaksa.eu/2025/02/in-reply-to-tracys-guiding-principles-for-my-website/ and https://jamesg.blog/2025/03/05/philosophy-of-james-coffee-blog

Jo's radio station: https://dead.garden/radio/
** https://kingposs.com/radio
** Collaborative radio
** https://sdf.org/?tutorials/anonradio
** What would it look like to have an open mic night on your own radio station?
** https://onsug.com/ is a collaborative podcast
 
 
 
https://blog.avas.space/ noted the question of what it would be like to have others write a post for your website (maybe just a friend)
** Jo, you're welcome to post on my website! - James (jamesg.blog)
 
* https://indieweb.org/representative_h-card
** {{mandaris}} The initial goal was to make things work with https://webmention.rocks/ and https://indieweb.org/
** https://indieweb.org/authorship 
** {{mandaris}}: Still confused in how it works as the validators do not show the author
 
"ombudsman"
* another idea: /words-of-hwc; a running list of unique words we mention on HWC
 
* {{artlung}}'s site updates this week:
** https://artlung.com/rsvp/ I have a spot to do my webmention rsvps now
** https://artlung.com/cssbattles/ is a new official page to track my css battles
** I've added more mixtapes at https://artlung.com/mixtapes/

* Reminders of other IndieWeb This Week!

** Front End Study Hall 024 is tomorrow https://events.indieweb.org/2025/03/front-end-study-hall-024-j8dtucnWT7Iz
 
* A (snarky) idea for a /yes page: something you can share with people in heated discussions
** "What do you think?" "https://example.com/yes"
 
Neat idea: adding an editing interface on your web pages at the bottom so you don't need to transition to a different editing UI.
 
You can change the details/summary icons in CSS. Michael has done this on his website.
