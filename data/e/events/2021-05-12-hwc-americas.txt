== Notes ==
* James has restarted writing his website software - "Nginx is kicking my butt 'cause I was always an Apache guy"
* Discussion of Nginx X-ACCEL-REDIRECT for protection of static assets leads to talk of private webmentions - length of time to store a token, for instance
* Private WM vs AutoAuth
* Private posts - what considerations change if your implementation accomodates users who don't have websites by offering logins, etc.?
** Imagine sending a private webmention to logged-in users who have a webmenton endpoint on their own site, but instead sending an email, a Twitter DM, etc notification if the user has one of those accounts
* Jeff's Gourmet Sausage Factory, 8930 W Pico Blvd https://www.jeffsgourmet.com/
** Will Dave write Dave's Guide to Restaurants? and post it on his website? time will tell...

Lengthy discussion of privacy, biometric data, children using the web, and literal "shit posting" led to the three remaining HWC participants ({{maxwelljoslyn}}, {{lahacker}}, {{KartikPrabhu}}) putting a popup session proposal into the wiki:
