== Joe's Zoom Background ==
* 
* [https://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page Microformats.org] codifies ways to embed data into documents.
** Originally I wanted to use an original 1995 Dublin Core page of some kind as a backdrop but reading the history  in a way that builds on previous work adding metadata to documents. I originally was thinking about Dublin Core https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core https://www.dublincore.org/resources/metadata-basics/ https://schema.org/ https://ogp.me/ and earlier ideas such as ICBM metadata https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICBM_address or PICS labels https://www.w3.org/PICS/labels.html ...the goal of making documents on the web richer, more discoverable, more findable, better indexed and cross-refer

* Taylor Swift JSON-LD example: https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph

* Rel Edit https://jamesg.blog/2025/05/09/extending-my-edit-web-page-bookmarklet

* educational institutions, libraries, library information technologies
* MARC format. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_standards)
* OCLC (Ohio College Library Consoritum, the creators of Dublin Core): https://www.oclc.org/en/home.html
*Citing a book what it is, edited contribution

* Folksonomy - tagging and tag views on twitter is how {{gregorlove}} connected with {{artlung}} on Twitter
* James found the IndieWeb via Chris Aldrich using hashtags on Twitter.
* Link tags connect to things like stylesheets but are invisible to the user
** James: I love stylesheets :D
* Link tags have the capacity to denote a "next" or "prev" or "index" to create relationships between pages in a set, much of that is unimplemented in browsers
* I want my orange browser-based RSS button back. ''AMEN!''
* At one time [[RSS]] / [[Atom]] icons were built into browsers to display that icon and make it clickable via auto discovery

* HTML "rev" history - In an HTML 2 document I spottedan idea of not just link rel but the reverse of that link, link rev

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF_Schema RDF Schema - Wikipedia] 
** Failed promise: https://artlung.com/blog/2024/05/31/goodbye-foaf/
* RDF lots of parameters, computationally expensive
* Tom Guber ontologies of folksonomies -  - smallest viable ontology - being able to explain - https://tomgruber.org/writing/ontology-of-folksonomy.htm
* Having triples within RDF - relationhips in RDF are action, subject, 
* XRD is more flexible - https://docs.oasis-open.org/xri/xrd/v1.0/xrd-1.0.html, https://equalsdrummond.name/2008/09/06/xri-in-a-nutshell/

== Burning Questions 1 ==
* From Jo Editing things on a canvas?
* Form data is edited on an image
* given a document with no server, and only client-side code, can a section of page or a canvas element update in real time?

* yes, with event handlers to listen to form elements, and then update the target section:

** James' code: https://gist.github.com/capjamesg/8e848debf2d89e5b5f910f7bb81f81b4
** Claude example of drawing input text to a canvas: https://poe.com/chat/kr50o8zlvszldw1zsp
** Taylor Swift example: https://gist.github.com/capjamesg/eee8640d41d5d9272f1052086c049346

== Burning Questions 2: Performance on iOS ==
* JavaScript animation which updates based on user input on a slider range element has terrible performance
* Performance transform with keyframes
* iOS 15 is slow, visual display janky
=== Answer ===
* '''debounce!'''
** a function that runs too frequently can be the cause of performance issues of this
** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Debounce Debounce] on MDN
** Some check to assure that if the function is running not to start another
** time based programming with setTimeout or setInteval can be useful - to create an event loop that will do an action under certain conditions

==Joe's Green Lined Paper Demo==

* The chat on Bluesky  https://bsky.app/profile/artlung.com/post/3lpkgdxhszk25
* Dot matrix printer playing "Eye of the Tiger": https://youtu.be/u8I6qt_Z0Cg

* https://lab.vanderwal.net/
* Personal infocloud! Places where we can experiment with web pages are good! Putting up interim versions for experimentation is part of learning "the grain of the web" https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/ also mentioned in Matthias Ott's recent talk "Painting with the Web" at Beyond Tellerand

== Try ==

* Followup From [[events/2025-05-08-front-end-study-hall|Fresh #027]]
** {{artlung}} spent some time on a JavaScript-less version of {{reillypascal}}'s nav and hamburger menu which uses zero-height elements, has() and :focus-within to take a stab at an accessible, JavaScript-less menu
** Codepen: https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/raagwmm

== Catch ==

* [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awesome-rss/ ''Awesome RSS''] toolbar icon he uses remains compelling and a demonstration of the utility of making link rels visible!
** First spotted by the crew of [[events/2025-02-25-front-end-study-hall|Fresh #022]]
** RSS and Atom don't get enough love from browsers


* Safari on Mac doesn't allow setting webmail as the target for mailto: Joe made a bookmarklet to rewrite them this past week https://lab.artlung.com/safari-mailto-webmail/

== Finally ==

* GO MAKE A WEB PAGE
