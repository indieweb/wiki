== Notes ==
===Happy Thursday, everyone :) ===
* https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/RwXmXYw a Codepen showing a radio button to set state for a layout and has() to read the radio button
* https://artlung.com/ uses that technique to do hamburger-style sidebars
** Joe uses the transform() function to display his sidebar, it starts at -100% (outside the viewport) and scaled down to 10% of the size, and then slides into view as it grows.
*** We changed the transition from .5s(?) to 12s to see it go slower (and it looked similar to the old MacOS genie effect!)
*** On the topic of accessibility of menus and sidebars, Jira shows a popup on the top left corner when you're tabbing through the page to allow users to switch between areas of the screen: https://ibb.co/qjjt9Rn
