Huffduffer:

* {{gRegor}} uses this to bookmark individual episodes of podcasts that I want to check out without subscribing to the full feed. I add a to-listen tag, then I subscribe to the RSS feed of that tag in my podcatcher and voila.

More history: {{t}}'s Box Model Hack - http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html the bad old days where we had to code things twice and hide some CSS from browsers with hacks in the code

Site search:
* [[search]]
* {{capjamesg}} set up a search form for DuckDuckGo. The form submits a GET request and a hidden field that sends the value `site:example.com`, so it will search only his domain.

Kind of related to the USB idea, I recently came across this idea of a Digital Free Library, like Little Free Library but a small server on a Raspberry Pi

Mark Martin was a creator who {{artlung}} followed in the 90s and acquired a comic from 1991 https://www.amazon.com/20-Nude-Dancers-Year-Two/dp/B0006RNX1K https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Martin_(cartoonist) - his website is now defunct. He was one of the first cartoonists {{artlung}} encountered with a website and he posted comics there
