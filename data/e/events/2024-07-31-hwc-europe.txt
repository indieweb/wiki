** How about a collection of movies (books, whatever) that we didn't like? (Kind of like https://baty.net/nope)

* Feed readers that we use
** Fresh RSS reader with Full Text Feed to extract the full text of articles
*** http://ftr.fivefilters.org/ is a demo service that takes a feed and returns another feed you can subscribe to that has the full article.  You can also run this as a docker container on a self hosted site
*** https://freshrss.org/index.html the freshrss home page - this is also available as a docker container to run self hosted.  It installs as a PWA app on your phone so your read/unread markers are synced between desktop and mobile.
