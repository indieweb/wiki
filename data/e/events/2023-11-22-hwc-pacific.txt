WebMentions
* Matt tried to add webmentions: https://mattcool.tech/posts/adding-web-mentions
* He doesn't think he succeded- Joe is helping test. Here's my attempt to webmention: https://artlung.com/blog/2023/11/22/testing-webmentions-with-matt-cool/ 
** It appears it was received by webmention.io: https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=https://mattcool.tech/posts/adding-web-mentions but Matt's site may not be parsing it yet. Is it a static site that needs to regenerate?

We learned from Pablo that this exists: https://hastingsmuseum.org/exhibit/kool-aid/

[[Gravatar]] has rolled out account verification to external accounts like Instagram and GitHub and others - maybe attempting to be a pivot point for digital identity. For example my own profile has a few links which link out and provide the classic Twitter-style "verified" icon to those which I've done an OAuth flow with: https://gravatar.com/artlung 
* interesting their page advertises `<link rel="profile" href="https://microformats.org/profile/hcard" />` but has no hcard on it?

https://defaults.rknight.me/ -- 164 bloggers have participated in this posting "meme" 
* If we participate we should link to Tracy to create an awesome node graph.

I noticed rknight has their entire game collection here: https://rknight.me/collections/games/

San Diego Planning
* [[Planning#San_Diego]]
* Might be worth sending a note to SD PHP Meetup group: https://www.meetup.com/SanDiegoPHP/, might get some interest
** {{gRegor}} has attended (and presented about microformats once!) in the Before Times. I can reach out to https://johncongdon.com/ once the date/venue is settled.
*** ✔️ sent a message via meetup.com, couldn't find contact info on his site
** Mitch Wagner has said he would RSVP via micro.blog - {{artlung}} has known Mitch https://micro.blog/MitchW/26606911  ~ 20 years. Was on the radio talking about blogging back in 2002. https://artlung.com/blog/2018/03/15/transcript-kpbs-the-lounge-on-blogging/ 
** Blackmarket Bakery is the venue: https://www.blackmarketbakery.com/

... prompted a lot of discussion on interesting frontend things - animation, css graphics, page transitions and other fun creative websites...

* Made by https://lynnandtonic.com/ (great domain) and they have several other fun sites listed there
* Like https://thedusting.zone/

What are folks working on on their websites?
* {{artlung}} updated a page for a visualization with bar graphs based on the number of posts per month https://artlung.com/visualization/ 
* {{aciccarello}} got a micropub server up running [[Indiekit]]. Most of the configuration was mapping post data to file text.
* {{gRegor}}: thinking about locking down [[local comment]]s on my site 12 months after published date, requiring sign-in with email to leave a comment. [[Akismet]] is catching a lot of spam but missing a few each week; reporting them manually as spam is getting old / not sure Akismet is even doing anything with the reports.
