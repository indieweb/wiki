* Bootstrap might have some useful CSS to borrow as a baseline: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/tables/#overview including responsive tables that can scroll left/right on desktop

* HTML table design considerations
** Column widths could be different so columns with narrow data take up less space
** Alternating row colours
** Left/right scroll?
** Sticky headers for persistence
*** I first read about sticky table headers here - https://btxx.org/posts/Please_Make_Your_Table_Headings_Sticky/

The Ultimate Guide to Designing Data Tables
https://medium.com/design-with-figma/the-ultimate-guide-to-designing-data-tables-7db29713a85a
** Best approach for huge data tables https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/100786/best-approach-for-huge-data-tables-currently-using-scrolls

** Data design: who is your audience? will they be interested in all the data at once, or want to explore into different areas? how will the table expand over time?
** You could use cards that let people compare each item one at a time on mobile
** If the data is going to grow to be big, you could embed a spreadsheet?
** you may want to use graphs too; graphs can help make data easier to understand.
** using as few words as possible is important in information design
** focus on contrasts between the data

** digital vs. physical reading differences; it can be harder to focus on reading on digital devices
** tts can be helpful for reading blog posts
** molly white records versions of her blog posts on Citation Needed (example: https://www.citationneeded.news/it-matters-i-care/)

** recording audio versions of your blog post
** poetry has cadence, so tts isn't as effective
** what does an interface for showing the audio look like?

* Public records departments have lots of civic data that you can use!
* The indie web has the power of doing things with civic data
* Personal websites + civics
