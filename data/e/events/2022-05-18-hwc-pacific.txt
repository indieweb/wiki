== Notes ==
Adding indieweb [[building blocks]] to static site generators
* [[webmention.io]] with javascript to load in webmentions
* https://webmention.herokuapp.com [[webmention.herokuapp.com]]

[[Mastodon]]
* Hollie wants to view streams from multiple Mastodon servers, has had to create an alt account on separate ones
* iOS app that handles multiaccounts well: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451 Toot!]
* https://mastodon.art curates and boosts accounts so helps discovery with other networks

{{gwg}} disappointed he missed meeting new people0
* It's not too late. turn on your video and say hi :)

Books
* [[BookWyrm]]
* {{fncll}} on BookWyrm: https://bookwyrm.social/user/fncll
* [[micro.blog]] bookshelves
* [[indiebookclub]]
* See [[read]] and [[book]]

Micro.blog
* Custom theming: https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59
* uses the [[Hugo]] engine, so I think that's what you really need to learn: https://gohugo.io/ (I need to do this myself for a project!)

Photo posting
* {{angelo}} would like to upload an album of photos to view them on desktop then select certain ones to publish
** {{gRegor}} might be possible to use a micropub client to upload multiple photos to an endpoint but not embed them in a post. Would need some sort of custom admin interface to browse/select, perhaps access control

nginx OAuth
* https://www.nginx.com/blog/validating-oauth-2-0-access-tokens-nginx/
* https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html
* https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/08/28/nginx-auth-request 
* [[Vouch Proxy]]

{{gRegor}}: GWG earned the "First Time Eating an Ear of Corn at Homebrew Website Club" badge, dubbed by me. So now I need to draw him this badge -- no guarantees on quality.
