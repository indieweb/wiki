** how do you make a sustainable website that goes beyond the performance aspects
** there are lots written up about how to make a fast / small website
*** there is incentive to do that - helps users, search results, usability
** what can I do to make my website more sustainable that has nothing to do with web performance
** usability is part of sustainability?
*** easier for users to navigate around the website?
*** but how would you quantify this?
*** usefulness of a given site? (is the signal/noise ratio high - does the site publish a lot of unnecessary content)
* graphical representations of discovery
** zoom into circles - an interesting way to navigate content on a website
*** bookmarks are really interesting
*** RSS feeds by circle?
*** how do you categorise things that don't have existing tags
