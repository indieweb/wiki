== Topics ==
=== Does webspeed matter for personal websites ===
See: https://indieweb.org/performance

Multiple fonts? They load very slowly.

Bootstrap was 50x the size of the HTML he was trying to communicate

* Reasons why to have better speed
** Readers with poor bandwidth
** Saving website/server resources

=== Archive ===
To ascend or to descend, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

* [[archive]] page design
* chronological or reverse-chronological?
* see chat for more discussion early that day

Eric Meyer has an article referenced from {{kartik}}'s article find them here: https://kartikprabhu.com/articles/webs-arrow-time#notes
<blockquote>Eric Meyer has written about this before in <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/200403.html#d29t1415">Weblog Weirdness</a> and <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/200403.html#d31">First-Order Solutions</a>. Notice that those pages have posts in a proper chronological order though his homepage is in reverse-chronological order. He also uses the “older to left” pattern on his archive pages.</blockquote>

Accessiblity and language/cultural preferences

From a UI perspective, language may affect how people perceive and think about time in various settings:
