We have lots of search-centric code, idioms, tech around finding things!

== Other Notes about Search, google, etc! ==

* I still hide my email address on my website using javascript: https://github.com/btrem/create-mailto
So it's visible in plain text (so a user can copy and paste it into their email client of choice) or, if javascript is on, it will turn the email address into a link.

* Logotypes with exclamation marks! Google! did have that at one time, as did Yahoo!

* Findability of text on a page
* Drop caps using a GIF - would the string be visible
* If we created the Google! logo from the past in HTML & CSS we'd need to bring it out 
* https://greenbankplants.com/  The logo is an SVG element where the text "Greenbank Plant Nursery" is actual text for better searchability. Fun fact: there's microformats markup for that logo. Write up here: https://btrem.com/2021/04-svg-microformats
* text node in svg, tspan is a kind of span inside text
* DOM tree
* Search prior to Google was tough, Google made natural language search work far better - 
* "Mother of all searches"
* Google was far easier - dealt with misspellings and other variations in a way what worked well for finding text
* Digital library search where the "dash" version was findable, but the same search minus a dash did not work - too brittle
* Search is hard!
* featured snippets used to be a thing - justify
* classnames and attributes at one time were things to add to opt-out of Google summaries
* https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag#data-nosnippet-attr
* Perlfect CGI Search had a way to block certain parts of pages using html comments.

* Search engines influence what we expect of other search engines
* SAAB - why is the key entry there in the center console?!
* Standard controls - usabilty vs novelty
* Principle of Least Surprise https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment

* Usability - links want to be links
* Human factors! UX, Human Interface Guidelines
* Skeumorphic
* Ground something in a metaphor people understand
* Should icons and common metaphors be easily understood?
* Probably easier before the explosion/fracturing of media; so when there was only broadcast tv, it was more plausible for people to recognize the IBM logo with the actual "IBM" letters It might be harder today without the repetition of logs in limited media outlets..

* https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/introducing-apple-creator-studio-an-inspiring-collection-of-creative-apps/
* Expectations for understandability for logos

* "A search box will disappoint me"
** Either they are using Google search
** Not relevancy weighted, too often 
** MDN search is actually good

* "Site search for search"
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=search 
* Searching for things in date order - I want to be able to sift by date
* News sites ought to be orderadble (sortable?) by date
* Slack internal app search is good
** https://personalinfocloud.com/blog/2015/08/25/slack-is-more-than-chat-why-chat-is-the-trojan-horse-to-better-enterprise/ 
* backend databases often have a limitation on the minimum search string length - notably MySQL and others

* citation UI that uses popover:
** https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/link-dump-january-2026
** excellent use of popover and of dl / dt / 

* another DL / DT / DD example, with nested DLs, and multiple DLs grouped with divs and headings for each
** https://gmpg.org/xfn/11

* citation UI / e.g. for the user to copy to the clipboard
** use a read only text area
** on focus, select the text
** break out a button that invokes a copy to clipboard

// example of copying to the clipboard

const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
// when clicked, select the text in the h1, and copy t to clipboard
h1.addEventListener('click', function () {
    const range = document.createRange();
    range.selectNode(h1);
    const sel = window.getSelection();
    sel.removeAllRanges();
    sel.addRange(range);
    document.execCommand('copy');
});


* Example citation UI, bottom of this post:
** https://tantek.com/2025/122/b1/more-steps-indieweb-cybersecurity 
** uses "input type=text" element, and sets up handlers on them to select all upon clicking in the input element.
** point was to give users a more "obvious" click target for text to select to copy out
** could also use a "textarea" if it was multiline
** explicitly does NOT do a "Copy", because that could/would be suprising and may cause the user to unexpectedly lose what's in their clipboard

* Molly vs Gates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag once went on a tirade, apparently at  Gates during a meeting
* Web Standards Project WaSP
* Browser engineers were on the side of WaSP - can you be more harsh on us to amplify, be fair and be accurate
* "The web just works" these days. CSS exists for things and that's great. - James
