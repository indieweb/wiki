== Notes ==
* is now a good time to say that one thing missing from IndieAuth is some kind of fallback for when your (Authorization Server) AS or wherever goes AWOL?

* IndieAuth.com IndieLogin.com 
* Wasn't one of those meant to be EOL by now
* Decentralized to a single point
* Remember to take good notes for James to read - James :)
* We should document what the "participants" list refers to (as in, what the username corresponds to)

* Would be nice to include IndieWeb Carnival ([[indieweb-carnival]]) in the newsletter because I completely missed it. Or a Carnival deadline for submissions for people who aren't very active in the wiki/chats.
