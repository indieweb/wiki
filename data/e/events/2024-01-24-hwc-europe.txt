{{lazcorp}} added a Tag Cloud: https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/tagged

lots of hashtag discussion

clustering hashtags results on your site

auto-suggest / auto-complete hashtags

suggest additional hashtags, like "when you post with #runner you usually also post #running" and then being able to tab-complete accept adding that hashtag to your post

indicate trending of hashtags you typed via sparkline or n/d n/w n/m n/y etc.

hashtag UX: "this tag is trending on ..."

sneak follow a blocked domain to gather possibly undesirable hashtags
