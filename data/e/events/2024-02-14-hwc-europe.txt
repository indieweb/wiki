== Notes ==

The traditions connected with this week:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Shrovetide_Football

Since we did not have the time to go over everything we did last week for most people, I suggest we all write in the eatherpad what we did, and we can discuss the ones that are of interest to somebody else?
* {{sarajaksa}}
** I have added the filtering to my books page - since I already collect some metadata for my own purpose it made sense to just allow for filtering: https://sarajaksa.eu/books
** I have changed the filtering for my movie project from JavaScript to CSS and added James as another participant: https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/posters.html
** Finished the entries for this month carnivals: for IndieWebhttps://sarajaksa.eu/2024/02/indieweb-carnival-february-2024-the-technology-mediated-relationships/ and Aro https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/02/the-carnival-of-aros-february-2024-personal-understanding-of-romance-and-marriage-in-slovenia/ (if somebody have some thoughs about the Romance in their own culture, please participate in the later as well)
* {{jamesg}}

There is a community of folks on Instagram that like to post photos of their bookshelves
* They call it: bookstagram
* And individual photos: shelfies

https://joinbookwyrm.com/ - Activitypub-based equivalent of GoodReads

POSSE or PESOS to GoodReads?
* API access was dropped in 2020 (https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/Does-Goodreads-support-the-use-of-APIs) to "to continually improve our data management"
* The Goodreads still provides the RSS feeds of the updates and added/finished books

https://www.66books.co.uk/monthly-book-club - "Where 66 Books is open one weekend a month to members of the public & not businesses. 
Come alone, with a friend or bring your kids (no booking required) - it's 70% off all books for everyone!"

Feed for the Mastodon
* The problem with the duplication of the material - reader would need to check for the canonical and make sure to only show one

https://silentbook.club/ - List of meetups

{{artlung}} joined from the beach in San Diego https://flic.kr/p/2pyen8E  - this week I updated my custom theme to allow (limited) threading by adding replies to individual comments which required gutting all my custom code including the "walker" in the comment lister in WordPress. 
- had to drop off thanks everyone!
** That beach looks really nice

Book club
* Do we want a book club - in the similar style as the indieweb carnival? - we could do one book each month
* There is a book club that does the Terry Pracher books - quater of the book wach two weeks
* The Chicaago manual as in the Dracula daily style
* What would be a good format for the book like Powerbroker (?)?
* We could also have topic and each one reads the book on the topic

* Puzzles where at one point there's a challenge that combines Taylor Swift + ML: https://feats.aigrant.com/

How are people finding the IndieWeb home page?

Should we put the "Join" mini section above the "three big points"?

Should we copy edit the "three big points" to better reflect our modern audience that finds the IndieWeb site?
