| event_description = This talk presents an empirical study of Bridgy — a tool for engaging with social media without surrendering ownership of one’s content to platforms. Jack Jamieson will describe how Bridgy’s developers attempt (and sometimes fail) to maintain a service that is simultaneously antagonistic and dependent upon corporate platforms. This study presents a glimpse at what the Web might look like in the future, and identifies challenges and strategies for getting there.
