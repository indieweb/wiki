* Any suggestions of good, privacy-friendly polls platform for static sites?
** Google Forms, TypeForms, SurveyMonkey
** flatfiles + Perl/CGI
** Cryptpad might be an option https://cryptpad.fr/, thinking of a more privacy-focused 1:1 alternative to Google Forms, without getting into programming something or running some other open source software
*** Ross uses their other offerings in open source and it's great. +1 to this idea.
** Ross has used https://civs1.civs.us/ for _elections_, which isn't quite the same as surveys.  Good privacy and good political science, though!
** Found two open source options: https://github.com/LimeSurvey/LimeSurvey and https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks

* Database
* https://phinx.org/
** +1, it's great. I've also used https://github.com/odan/phinx-migrations-generator with it -- gRegor

* Migrations
** Django has the migrations
** Joe is using https://phinx.org/
** DBmate https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate

* HTMX - send html up and down the wire - Aaron and Morgan both use it
** JavaScript - include as simple as possible 
** Lightweight up and down html
