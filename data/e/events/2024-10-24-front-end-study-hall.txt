* {{artlung}}'s background today is of [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ The W3C CSS Validation Service] - it's been around [https://www.w3.org/wiki/CssValidator 21 years or so]
** How does {{artlung}}'s editor prevent validation errors? Uses PHPStorm for editing and keeps SCSS for any CSS. In so doing some validation occurs because missing or extra braces tend not to compile from SASS to CSS
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ln-8QM8KhQ Wes Bos Video "How is this website so fast?"] worth a watch about web performance with the case of an "old" looking site that is nonetheless very fast and explores *why* it's so fast?

=== Styling Links in 2024! ===
* Topic today prompted by {{alabut}} examining how to quantify whether the contrast of the links on his blog are adequate from an accessibility perspective
* {{mat.tl}} is now an accessiblity expert at his workplace has access to Cypress based testing tools
* [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ WebAIM color checker] can take two colors to get an initial determination of contrast, does not account for type weight, font size, other background element such as images or text shadows
* Nick remembers seeing a color contrast checker that uses background, text, and link colors...to check contrast of all 3... will share the link if I find it again. It wasn't this, but: https://contrastwizard.com/
* Contrast Grid also lets you measure multiple colors: https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/
* Brainstorming alternatives to underline links
** <code>text-decoration-color</code>
** sub-pixel length <code>text-decoration-width</code>
** light color behind only links?
** underlining may be unattractive, clash with other design and typographical goals, see tweaks to these less well-known CSS attributes, showed off by Eric Meyer:
*** <code>text-underline-offset: 0.15em</code>
*** <code>text-decoration-skip-ink</code>
*** <code>text-decoration-thickness</code>
*** <code>text-decoration-color</code>
** See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration
* [https://www.cypress.io Cypress] testing for accessibility, node-based page testing tooling, they allow for 1 free project, potentially useful for doing automated testing against actual web pages as they run in a browser

* Here's {{artlung}}'s [https://codepen.io/artlung/pen/qBeVxLL codepen] to explore some styling options for Al, which was a starting point, we then transitioned to...
* [[Firefox]] has excellent development tools, several Eric Meyer reminded us of and showed off in further exploring the style options for links for Al's page, and more:
** '''Animation Tab''' - in DevTools, shows animations that are running
** '''Changes Tab''' - to see a list of all CSS edits made against the current document's CSS
** '''Transition Editor''' is a tool to interactively manipulate a transition using a timeline graph, vs using keywords like <code>linear</code>, <code>ease-out-in</code>
** '''Polygon Editor''' - The polygons for <code>shape-outside</code> and for <code>clip-path</code> can be edited point by point. Look for the icon next to those attributes in Firefox
** MDN for <code>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/shape-outside shape-outside]</code> and <code>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path clip-path]</code>
* When will we get '''sound''' synthesis in the browser?
** We do have speech synthesis: <code>window.speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("front end study hall"))</code>

** Gradient background for links, example: <code>background:linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,0.5), rgba(128,128,128,0.5));</code>
** <code>text-decoration-offset</code> to move the link text-decoration underline around.
