* {{capjamesg}} had an idea for an indieweb contribution based zine, and another for a zine based on ones website and Benjamin Parry has made zines before and is working on such a thing. Showed a video of an piece of paper folded ina. classic 6 page with outer cover zine. He used Paper CSS: https://www.getpapercss.com/ - and is experimenting with generative art and illustration

* Ros completed the CSS for the CV on her website, and has an idea for a visualization of the time she spends programming
* {{capjamesg}} has worked out a layout for his poetry which is a bit more sparse; he's also created a blog posting interface for himself at https://jamesg.blog/create/ which is open to view, and secured because adding to the site requires adding to a private github respository.
* {{marksuth}} has done some dark and light mode adjustments, and is working on more tooling around uploading photos on mobile to make the experience more app-y (progress indicators for upload speed under restricted bandwidth conditions)
