== Theme: Validation! ==
Welcome to the last FrESH of 2025!

* Theme today! "Validators" 
** HTML https://validator.w3.org/nu, Atom/RSS feeds: https://validator.w3.org/feed/
** Joe's background is the HTML Validator?

* Why validate? When last validate? 
** {{gRegor}}: I definitely validate HTML less often, but in the past it's been crucial to making sure a site rendered similarly in all browsers, especially IE6 and IE versions up until about 10, iirc. IE11 and Edge onward, things seemed to get a lot more uniform. Nowadays I do still like to validate HTML5 just to make sure any edge cases likely are not due to our markup.

* markdown validation? https://babelmark.github.io/ 
* red on yellow error xhtml 
* error recovery in html rendering

* at all costs do your best to render the content

**Quote:
*** Adam Bosworth: The other issue was sloppy — HTML is really sloppy. In fact when we were building IE4 we had this very simple mantra. It doesn’t matter what you give us: we will render it. And every so often we sort of choke and we would stare at something we go “no no we will render this”– if table rows overlap table rows: we’d render if ‘s intersected with forms: we’d render. We didn’t care. Basically the general theory was it takes a licking and it keeps on ticking. And because we did that it meant that people could be very flexible and very sloppy about how they generated their content.

* XHTML 2: Electric Boogaloo
** 5>2 t-shirt by Maciej when HTML5 was battling XHTML2 https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/503088578
* XHTML2 was a failed attempt to make html MORE strict and less able to be authored by regular human beings

* Postel's Law:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle - from Jon Postel, "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others". It is often reworded as: "be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept".
** https://lawsofux.com/postels-law/
** Counterpoint: the more liberal you are in what you accept, the more undefined behavior comes to be relied upon.

* Networking must be error tolerant!
* "Infrastructure is great until it breaks, so we try not to let it break" - Kevin Marks

* HTML parsers ignore tags they don't recognize
* CSS is also fault tolerant - it ignores what it doesn't understand

* Fragile - conditionals / if / then and programming will it make CSS more fragile?

* uh oh my network froze 
* layers can get isolation
* iframe sandboxing
* CORS / fencedframe https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/fencedframe
* layers can make it possible to reduce organizational fragility

* grid - debugging
* JavaScript vs TypeScript

* xml / xhtml were draconian - proclaimed as a benefit
* html5 camp started with a conception of "every html page is valid" - take Postel's Law seriously.
* quirks mode / strict mode - behaviors - defining how the language worked
* html is now specified in a more organized way
* markdown has a lot of magic characters, exceptions
* The push for standardadization in markdown (https://commonmark.org/) 
** comparing markdown parsers https://babelmark.github.io/
* JavaScript: The Good Parts, by Douglas Crockford https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-good/9780596517748/

* there is a thing called 'standard js' which doesn't approve of semicolons https://standardjs.com/

== RSS, Interop, Extensions, Validations ==
* RSS Feeds / enclosures?
** Podcast RSS2 - other stuff into podcasts?
** RSS/Atom validation of included HTML - the Universal Feed Parser basically tries to deny enything that can run javascript in the browser  https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/html-sanitization/

** Apple defined their own podcast extensions and built a validator - it links to some 3rd party ones too https://podcasters.apple.com/support/829-validate-your-podcast

* There is no interop test suite for the add ons in RSS
* Monetization
* Dynamic and programmatic ad insertion?
* Adtech is not a good space, often deliberately breaks things

== Year in Review: What did you learn this year? ==
* Every Layout book https://every-layout.dev/

* calc can do operations like calc(1ch + 1rem) or calc(100vw - 1rem)
* 75ch can be used for widths
* pow is good for "harmonic ratios" in header sizes
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/pow
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/calc
* rem vs em
** em never released an album as good as "Fables of the Reconstruction".  rem all day, every day. (lol)
* page level rem
* https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html

* Positive stuff - at the highest level, the world is getting better, even as our reading of it gets worse https://fixthenews.com/p/the-telemetry
* Programming principles for self taught front-end developers https://piccalil.li/blog/programming-principles-for-self-taught-front-end-developers/
* Javascript Dos and Don'ts
https://muan.co/posts/javascript

== Do HTML forms allow for other HTTP verbs? ==
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST

* CalDav API
** 2 sides of the contract - server valid request - how do resolve when there are conflicts between for example the gmail address book and an iphone address book? Ultimately there must be a contract about what the resulting behavior ought to be

* a more detailed discussion of the difference between client worldviews recently https://ploum.net/2025-12-15-communication-entertainment.html

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type - (CRDT)
** I'll bet my bottom dollar there's a CRDT behind this Etherpad
*** It might still be an Operational Transform, which is what we used before CRDT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation
HTTP Verb "PATCH"
* Registry of many HTTP verbs you probably haven't heard of: https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml

* Douglas Crockford in his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg YUI Talk: JavaScript The Early Years] mentions the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270 IBM 3270] as a terminal which takes a "page" of data with user enterable fields which a user could take a chunk of, then hit a "SUBMIT" button to send it back to a mainframe, of which he says "does that sound like a form application?" (See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg?t=41m29s 41:29]

== What is recent good stuff, recently or in the past few years? ==
* CSS Day in Amsterdam
* moving things out of JS and into HTML/CSS

* Joe's good stuff - 
** HTML and CSS and support in browsers has gotten so much better was inspired to do more, and start [[FrESH]]
** Doing CSS Battles has helped him focus on writing the minimal code to accomplish the desired target

* "The shorter the code the fewer places for bugs to hide" - {{t}}
