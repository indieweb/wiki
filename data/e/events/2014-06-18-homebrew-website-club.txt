=== San Francisco notes ===
* [[User:Snarfed.org|Ryan]] hosted [http://brainnewstuff.com/ Brian], [[User:Kevinmarks.com|Kevin]], [http://walteryu.com/ Walter], and Charles at [http://quip.com/ Quip].
* Brian and the rest of us talked about full stack vs frontend development.
* Walter discussed StormSavvy, the webapp he's building that helps civil engineering projects manage different kinds of compliance. (He's a civil engineer by day.)
* Charles is primarily interested in owning quantified self type data - Strava, GPS, etc. We discussed lifestreaming/lifelogging platforms, ThinkUp, and Socialsafe.
* Kevin said he's still hoping to get NoterLive working again. We discussed Heroku deployment woes, Paas vs IaaS, etc.

=== Portland notes ===
* Aaron showed his latest work on [[indieauth.com]] and demonstrated posting with [[Quill]]
* Bret posted a photo on Instagram which was [[PESOS|PESOS'd]] to his site with [[OwnYourGram]]
* Discussion about what an alternative DNS system would look like. Possibly based on a web of trust, with no single registry of domains.
** Similar to how a group of people can refer to each other by first name, and don't need to disambiguate until someone with the same first name shows up. 
* Definitely a need for making domain name registration easier
* [[User:Jasonwoj.com|jasonwoj.com]] set up IndieAuth on his domain and signed in to the wiki!
* Jason also demo'd https://getclef.com/ as an auth mechanism
* Jason and Aaron talked briefly about news.indiewebcamp.com, wanting to further refine it and see how it could be adapted to serve other communities 
* ...

=== Chicago notes ===
* {{gRegor}} began working on adding [[notes]] to his site. See his [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes|notes implementation]].
* Kartik worked on a top-secret-ish project.
* ...

=== Minneapolis notes ===
* {{tantek}} gave an introduction to the IndieWeb, how frustrations with [[silos]] has led folks to start (re)building their own sites and solutions to create content on their own site first. 
** demonstrated tantek.com home page as similar to a stream of tweets
** showed individual permalink notes along with note prev/next navigation (UX beyond Twitter)
** showed [http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/25/indiewebcamps_create_tools_for_a_new_internet.html Dan Gillmor Slate article] from [[Posts about the IndieWeb]]
** clicked through to show [http://dangillmor.com/2014/04/25/indie-web-important/ original on Dan's blog]
** scrolled to show interactions from [[Twitter]], [[Google+]] all collected back to his own site thanks to [[Bridgy]]
** pointed out how Dan's original posts are richer and more comprehensive than on any silo.
* did introductions
* Tantek - works for Mozilla, growing the open independent web. Has notes (tweets) and replies working on his site, working on [[reposts]] (retweets) on his own site, figuring out good UX for that.
* Kurt Froehlich - web developer. does not have his own website, but his band has a website. It was made by a fan, but wants to take it back and rebuild it. Show band concert dates by integrating it with [[Google Calendar]], and bring together images and posts from [[Instagram]].
* Ben - grabara.com. Nothing there today - just wanted to own it for an easy email address.
* Annette - has two websites annettediana.com and annettedianadesign.com - both are down at the moment. cobbler's children problem. 
** Would like to use it more for photo blogging. Does not have anything to say - "I don't tweet at all". [[Instagram]] like crazy though. But Instagram is too small - would like the pictures that she takes to be bigger. 
** annettedianadesign is just her portfolio. gets frustrated with [[WordPress]]. does not do enough dev to be able to figure out how to restyle it. frustrated with comment problem. too many robots commenting on all pages of her portfolio. feels overwhelmed because not a developer. just wants to make things that are beautiful
* Scott Parker - tech writer. have been studying HTML5 and CSS3 for a few months. trying to get back into it. haven't had a website since let his University account expire. likes the idea of the indieweb movement.
* Nicole - nicoletollefson.com - nothing there right now. would like to have blog posts there. would like to use it for music, blogging.
* discussed challenges with WordPress, but also how there's a good set of WordPress folks in the IndieWeb community building plugins for IndieWeb functionality.
* encouraged everyone to figure out what is the next itch they want to scratch, whether getting (renewing) their domain, or a web host, putting up a static contact page that links to other profiles etc.
* demonstrated using [[IndieAuth]] to log-in to the IndieWebCamp wiki, and briefly discussed how [[rel=me]] makes that possible.
