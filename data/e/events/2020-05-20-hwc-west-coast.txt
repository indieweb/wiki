=== Media libraries and playlists ===
Goals:
* organize my media so I can find things
** e.g. music collection (LPs, mp3, CDs)
** big on meta data, artists, when released

Challenges: 
* metadata attempts are inconsistent, e.g. composer vs performer, movements in classical music
** {{jgmac1106}} example: https://jgregorymcverry.com/musiccollection.txt list of 1,000s folders (realized OwnCloud doesn't allow more than 1,000 files and figured out why half his music was missing)
*** unkown artist my most popular

Structured data for that:
* MusicBrainz.org https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema
* Discogs.com
* https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q169226 WikiData of Sgt Peppers Album
* Musicbrainz equivalent https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/9f7a4c28-8fa2-3113-929c-c47a9f7982c3

Another current example https://timstwitterlisteningparty.com/

[[radio|Radio]] station of media posts from your friends

See [[Huffduffer]]

Brainstorming
* https://indieweb.org/podcast#How_to_podcast_with_h-feed

What is the media equivalent of author?
* executive producer? (joke...)

Specifically for music, who is the "author"?
* performer
* composer
* lyric writer
* producer
* MP3 ID3 tag has only one field for this

Is there markup on the sites for ASCAP or BMI who handle payments to creators?

fuzzy matching graphs of media content https://fornax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Status property = https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/18

Who is the author for a video?
* e.g. a Zoom meeting recording?
* Author is the person who recorded it in simple video/audio
* contributor for people involved - is part of the podcast spec

=== Best of lists ===

Examples:
* Bass players: http://longthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/doku.php?id=musichour
** Use-case: toward creating something
* Favorite films:  http://tantek.com/w/WatchFilms#Favoritemoviesyoushouldsee

How about list to experience?
* Films/movies to watch:  http://tantek.com/w/WatchFilms#MoviesIwanttosee
 

=== Streaming from your own site ===
* real time a/v for streaming, hosting & active progress watch, active realtime watch posts

What {{aaronpk}} showed up last week
* Facebook Live like streaming
* aaronpk built this setup for someone else
* aaronpk said he hacked up a chat for his live stream

How do you have live reactions
* Send a webmention from a site
* you in-reply-to the moment in the media
* You need both the time of published and to the reply time in the media
** [[media fragment]] JS  https://aaronparecki.com/2017/02/19/4/day-61-media-fragments
** working example:
<code><audio src="https://feedproxy.google.com/~r/SingularityWeblogPodcasts/~5/4471ZdmO-Go/821277562-singularity1on1-ada-palmer.mp3#t=02:17:30" controls />
</code>

=== Media storage alternatives ===
E.g. storing images on IPFS instead of git
for http://www.shimmy1996.com/
Tried a few other git extension 
* GitLFS, requires special support on the host server
* GitAnnex can sync between a few sources you know, but no way to go beyond the number of devices you have
With IPFS it can mount as a filesystem on your computer. 
No special headers like HTTP
To have compatibility with user space file system at /ipfs.
Can then keep images as symlinks to their /ipfs location.
Makes the whole blog git repo more portable, size is not that large.
DNSLink offers compatibility with existing domain names, and HTTP gateways allows accessing IPFS contents via regular web browsers, i.e. http://ipfs.io/ipns/shimmy1996.com
