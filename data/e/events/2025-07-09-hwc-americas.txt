*** css:

* Internationalized sites
** Can route directly on things like Accept-Language header, but what if your sites don't have parity?  Do you want to send a user to their default preference or to your best work?
** The <q> element quotes smartly per language!  (e.g., German gets â€žthis", English gets "this")

Transit json feeds (GTFS) and open licensing
 * Attempting to add LA Metro route info to Traewelling https://traewelling.de/
 * Traewelling only allows open data licenses https://help.traewelling.de/en/features/timetable/
 * Traewelling pulls from transitious , https://github.com/public-transport/transitous/
 * Transit Land appears to be the source of truth for licensing, e.g. https://www.transit.land/routes/r-9q5c-2
 * LA Metro does not clearly define an open license ...
 * ...although it is recommended by the state at https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp/california-transit-data-guidelines-faqs#faq-howToSelectLicense
 * Next step, write my friendly government contact at LA Metro to define open license!
