* What would an IndieWeb forecast be like?
** Sunny with a chance of websiting
** Cloudy with a chance of webs

*** Accessibility considerations of websites that change depending on time of day
** https://mxb.dev/ has a cool theme picker
** What would it look like for a user to bring their own stylesheet to your website?
** You could use microformats to get a preferred stylesheet that a site could use
*** There are security considerations.
** <meta> theme tag is standardised that could be retrieved https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color
* User agents have the capacity to set their own styles
** Browsers can set preferred styles for things like font size minimums
** High contrast mode, dark mode -- examples of preferences
** CSS color-mix for mixing colors together

* Themes

* James recommends WAVE for accessibility testing
* https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ is good for color contrast checking
** https://www.oddcontrast.com/#p3__color(display-p3_0.95396_0.90414_0.82164)__color(display-p3_0.29951_0.22348_0.20055)
** https://randoma11y.com/
** https://lab.artlung.com/root-color-properties-editor/ allows you (in FF or Safari) to edit :root color properties such as on Zachary's site
** App for Windows + Mac https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/
* input[type=range] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range
* Michael has a tool on his site that adjusts a style attribute on the HTML element to set the filter: filter: brightness(101%) contrast(107%) sepia(0) brightness(100%) hue-rotate(-8.4deg)
* https://coolors.co/ was mentioned in the most recent FrESH as a tool to explore color palettes
* Named colors have consistent RBG definitions https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color - but the appearance of color on an individual screen depends on eveything in your operating system, monitor hardware, monitor settings, ambient light in the room, and is also affected by the visual abilities of the viewer

* James wants to experiment with a pink theme one day
* James also wants to do a cherry blossom theme

* How many colors do we have in our site themes?

Needs more documentation, but this was the origin of my thoughts to bring a custom spreadsheet to websites: https://github.com/carrvo/BinaryCmdlet-Demos/tree/master/PSGUITest

* Being a user of your own website; pride in how your site looks

* Browsers are good at working with incorrect / not semantically valid code

Validation: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmandarismoore.com%2F

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle 
** ''In computing, the robustness principle is a design guideline for software that states: "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others". It is often reworded as: "be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept". The principle is also known as *Postel's law*, after Jon Postel, who used the wording in an early specification of TCP.''

* There are tensions in designing technologies: security, customisability, extensibility, user preferences, etc.

* https://www.cssbed.com/ was mentioned in FrESH #019 as "classless" CSS. [[events/2025-01-16-front-end-study-hall#Options_for_setting_up_a_site_quickly?]]?

* James appreciated https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/11/18/foundations-types-of-disability/ as an introduction to considering disabilities users may have when designing web pages.

* Pop up on publishing workflows
** Blocker of posting on website vs. Mastodon vs. elsewhere
** How do we choose what to write and where
** May relate to the idea of audiences: who do you want to see the post?
** RSS only posts?
** Everyone has a different approach to their publishing workflows
