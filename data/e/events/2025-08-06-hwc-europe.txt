== Notes ==
* Welcome to Homebrew Website Club!
* https://http.cat
* [[POSSE]]
* Jon is using Astro and Laravel
** https://marksuth.dev/ uses Laravel
* https://github.com/capjamesg/aurora
* The tools we use to make our websites
** James uses Ghost and Aurora
** Jo uses HTML, SFTP, and the command line with https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog (fork here https://github.com/deathcomestotime/indieweb-bashblog)
** {{zachary.kai}} just uses static html files uploaded via SFTP to the web host (also has a VPS)
** {{alabut}} uses Astro to build a static website (with one new experimental section that pulls in data from Notion's API) and triggers builds by pushing up commits to GitHub which triggers a new build where it's hosted on Netlify
** {{reillypascal}} uses 11ty; pushes to GitHub, which triggers Netlify build.
** {{rossabaker}} uses Hugo, pushes to his self-hosted Forgejo, which triggers Nix build
** {{pjg1}} uses Jekyll to build files locally, and hosts on GitHub Pages
** {{vanderwal}} uses home rolled PHP CMS from 2000, but also has another site on WordPress

* Previewing posts before we publish them
* Hosting images on Flickr to use on our websites (Michael does this)
* https://hetzner.com
* https://contabo.com/en/
* https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/
* https://git-lfs.com/ for large file storage on Git [[Git_Large_File_Storage]]

* James' website likes to take an unscheduled holiday on Christmas

* The decision to use a server vs. not use a server
** Trade-off between having more control / limiting maintenance costs

* if "laziness is the mother of invention" then "necessity is the father"
* Authoring HTML on our phones?

* The IndieWeb Movie Club for the month is Local Hero (https://vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=2128)

* "if it's not in etherpad it doesn't exist" :D

* Loura, you may like the https://magicalgurll.com/ website. I (James) saw it this week and loved the design! It reminds me a bit of your video game theme.
** I missed the full conversation but similar video game feeling: https://ellesho.me

* XSLT for styling feeds [[XSLT]]
** https://reillyspitzfaden.com/feed.xml 
*** https://reillyspitzfaden.com/styles/rss-styles.xsl
*** inspired by https://rachsmith.com/feed.xml 
*** Someone found the link before me :D - James
** https://www.kupietz.com/filemaker-ddr-analyzer/ - not really a website thing, generated by doing an XSL transform on FileMaker's giant XML database design reports to turn them into a CSV of entity relations, then analyzed in a database to map dependencies between any two entities, which then spits out a .DOT directed graph file for a webassembly port of GraphViz to display online.

* Ways to make RSS more approachable / interesting

* James uses https://subscribeopenly.net/subscribe/?url=https://jamesg.blog/feeds/posts.xml to link to his feed, so people don't see the XML.

[[SubToMe]]
* https://www.subtome.com

* {{alabut}} is building a site to keep track of library books he has checked out, and which ones are due soon.
** Data is collected in Notion and then turned into a website: https://alabut.com/projects/library/list
** Data is also collected from the automated emails and scraped into a google sheet, which then imports or updates records in Notion.
* James' vinyl project: https://jamesg.blog/2024/03/16/vinyl-record-indexing
* IndieWeb Book Club for keeping track of books: http://indiebookclub.biz/

* Notion MCP, for use with AI tools: https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp
* https://help.obsidian.md/bases (in beta right now, coming soon) are like Notion databases but in Obsidian
* https://library.jamesg.blog/

* Have we sent a website to space?
* https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/esrs/hdev/
* WWW but intergalactic

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/tim-peake-parents-stem-astro-pi-raspberry-pi-computers-space-launch/
* How to brew coffee in space: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvIT3l9QYnQ
* Al's blog post about the coffee brand that's been to space, Death Wish Coffee: https://alabut.com/writing/coffeeforpics/
* Death Wish's press release about their trip to the ISS: https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Death-Wish-Coffee-returning-to-International-13935222.php

* Zachary edited his website from his phone during the call!

* {{reillypascal}} looking for accessible but visually distinct code comment colors
* E.g., https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2025/05/databending-part-4/ 
* https://catppuccin.com/ colour theme
* https://rosepinetheme.com/
* Prot's Emacs themes
** more contrast: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes
** more colorful: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes
** more monochromatic: https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes
** Tools to figure out colors
*** https://accessiblepalette.com/
*** https://randoma11y.com/
*** https://huetone.ardov.me/
*** https://developer.paciellogroup.com/color-contrast-checker/ (just saw this on the Fediverse!)
** Editing colours and checking accessibility using Firefox: https://editor.jamesg.blog/content/images/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-20.17.31.png
*** The colour picker lets you see, in real time, the contrast between the colour you have selected and the background.
** James uses the https://pygments.org/ Python package to generate syntax highlighting. It has a few colour schemes you can choose from. 

* IndieWeb Carnival for this month https://marisabel.nl/public/blog/IndieWeb_Carnival_August_2025_:_Colors

* {{artlung}} misspoke. Flash compatibility library is Ruffle. 
* https://ruffle.rs/ (not Flutter)
* Dunstan Orchard's old blog, which used a Flash header that showed the weather, sun moving across the sky, sheep moving in the field - https://1976design.com/blog/
* Information about the panorama: https://www.1976design.com/blog/colophon/#the-pano
* There are 90 variations of the header of his site, static images, it appears: https://www.1976design.com/blog/colophon/panoramas/

* {{jo}} is thinking about colour schemes for her website.

* [[digital_garden]]
* Some naming ideas for slash pages: slash pages, "shelf", digital garden, "wiki-like"

* https://valentine.bearblog.dev/
** "have a look through the shelves:"

* Tracking movies on our websites
** {{vanderwal}} is working on this!
** https://jamesg.blog/movies
** Letterboxd, lists we maintain ourselves
** https://www.benji.dog/watched
** [[movie]]
** https://dead.garden/films/ (I get the letterboxd rss for my reviews and let https://rss.bloople.net/ render it)

** Benji's micropub client for publishing movie posts: https://sparkles.sploot.com
** Benji demo'd how he publishes movies to his website with Sparkles then syndicates them to Letterboxd (using POSSE)
** http://github.com/benjifs/micropub

* Using Python and beautifulsoup to find broken links
* https://ahrefs.com/broken-link-checker is great for finding broken links too
** James and Michael have used this for their personal websites
* If a link is broken on your website you may replace it with an Internet Archive link
** Waybackify is a WordPress/Perl script combo
** https://www.jwz.org/blog/2019/02/waybackify/ https://www.jwz.org/hacks/ is an older set of files to implement forcing older links to point at Internet Archive
** I believe {{GWG}} is looking for solutions to this common problem
** Linkrot is endemic and has a solid wikipedia entry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot

* https://subethaedit.net/ ("Google Docs before Google Docs") with powerful collaborative text editing

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave

* https://jamesg.blog/cool-designs

* {{Angelo}} demoed a really cool project and led to a few "Angeloisms" that were worth capturing
* "you made a useful 404 page! that's so cool!"
* Re: Al's "write down the idea"; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVeAuwU-uuU

* "i'm routinely amazed by my past work"
* "it's gold, it's gone" (the rollercoaster of emotions around finding and immediately losing a great idea)
* "python restricts my ability to introspect"
* "the minutes got spicy, as they do"
* "sometimes just a pinch of markdown is enough"
* Angelo's approach to making his website infinitely malleable reminds of several important concepts:
    ** Logo turtles as a way to program/create/think
    ** Tim Berners-Lee's book on "read/write/web" origins of the initial concepts of the web
    ** Donald Knuth's literate programming - code should be not just readable but heavily documented and narrative in nature, more like language than just purely math and equations
    *** {{rossabaker}}'s configs section is based on this concept.
    **** Favorite implementation: https://orgmode.org/
    ** Standing on the shoulders of giants

* Angelo made https://ragt.ag/books
* The web as a combined browser/composer -- a vision of TBL

* https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI

* "you're an old soul clinging onto the wisdom of yesterdecades greats"

* http://www.rememberaaronsw.com/memories/We-have-lost-a-fighter.html
** "And so here was this person who, on the face of it, was a coder. He knew that by writing code that was one way of changing the world. You could change the world directly by giving somebody a hug. You could write a piece of code that would make life easy for a whole lot of people. You could build a website which would make it easier for people to communicate, to work together."

Combining ideas to build a new web

* "Seeing people use Netlify makes my stomach churn."

* Making personal websites with the idea that the website could be used by a friend
* Having friends around to help you with your website makes it fun / easy to build collaborative primitaves for your website
* You need collaboration to write collaborative tools
* Questions help us think through problems (and others' questions help us form our ideas)
* When you think about websites as for friends, you can focus on the creative parts rather than the spam parts.

* "Remove people from the room who's first response/mindset to a new idea are all the reasons why of “it can't work”. - Steve Blank
** and bring them back in when you need to validate it

* "Opinions aren't ideas" - Jony Ive at a Stripe session on creativity
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLb9g_8r-mE

* James: "how can we make our websites more collaborative and social spaces, like the intent of the original web?"

** James' question and Angelo's creativity was a great example of "a force dyad" - two people who push each other's boundaries that are individually unique and yet complimentary in ways that couldn't create the same levels of insight on it's own.
** Super nerdy explanation of a force dyad in Star Wars: https://star-wars-canon.fandom.com/wiki/Force_dyad

* "the devil's in the details" - Taylor Swift https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxX4ZE4KWE
* "read write web"

* Compounding complexity in collaborative software is a problem. But if you start small you can make cool things!

* {{benji}} shared his experience with HTML Day and how hard it was for people to put their website up on the web
** "I love helping people 1-on-1, but I can't help the world put their website up"
** {{alabut}} saw this same obstacle point whenever teaching people html basics - making the page on their local computer is fun and easy, sharing and hosting is insanely hard (and scary)
** So what would a service to host HTML (maybe not even CSS) look like in a simple scalable way?
** {{Angelo}} "what I want is neocities but with php, your own personal little nginx."
** Like a shared codepen?
* You can invite more contributors to Ghost

* https://dead.garden/blog/this-post-was-typewritten.html
** https://dead.garden/blog/space-news-to-look-forward-to.html
* Printing out our blog posts
* https://goodinternetmagazine.com/

* https://boston-html-day.neocities.org/collab -- HTML written on paper

* Print out a page, add hand-written edits, then get those computers back into an Etherpad box
* Print out code and write on it -- annotate, share ideas!

* "bounce between what each medium is good at" -- combining the paper and the digital (and, by extension, using static and dynamic)
* hand-written annotations on a website would be cool!
** or little doodles on the sides

* "i'm waiting for the day your website has marginalia"

* https://youtu.be/0lL3PODLf_A?t=7 -- Blues Brothers apartment

* https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/28/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech/
** {{alabut}} has been gestating a post called "people not protocols"
** {{capjamesg}} also noodled "decentralization only won't solve everything"

* Jo's photo from HWC: https://dead.garden/photos/hwc.webp
* https://dead.garden/art/posts/pruefung.html

* Al misses drawing in sketchbooks and on whiteboards in the office environment
** His article on how to do group brainstorming with sketch pads: https://zapier.com/blog/run-a-design-studio/

* "group collaborativeness"

* {{capjamesg}} There are really interesting spheres to the social relationships in the indieweb (text, video, in person, audio), and you can assemble your own experience.

* {{alabut}} keeps threatening to make a physical magazine documenting the indieweb community or even smaller social circlesindee

* The military phrase for redundancy for important things, like coffee: "Two is one, one is none." 3-2-1 backup plan?

* Gutting a book: https://vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=2125
