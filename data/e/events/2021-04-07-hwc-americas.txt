	discussion of logo design process - would be OK with hiring someone if there was someone who could explain how things worked to interface with them 
	suggestion: document on the wiki what language we would use to explain the different standards to a graphic designer
		Jacob suggested this would be helpful for people new to the indieweb / non-technical folks - Tracy echoes this as a non-technical person
* discussion about replacing Gravatar with h-card - how to "syndicate" or "patch" changes to h-card (e.g. name, pronouns)
