=== Opening Prompt ===

* What do you like to write about?

=== Exploring Distance Through Writing ===

* Re: distance
** Distance and Alternative Signals of Status: A Unifying Framework by Silvia Bellezza 
** https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/50/2/322/6769896?login=false - abstract
** https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/citation_file_upload/Bellezza%20Distance%20Framework%20JCR%202023.pdf - PDF
*** "The proposed framework organizes alternative signals in terms of their distance from traditional status symbols and categorizes them along six focal dimensions: time (new/old), quantity (many possessions/few possessions), conspicuousness (conspicuous/inconspicuous), aesthetics (beautiful/ugly), culture (highbrow/lowbrow), and pace of life (slow/fast)"
* Real vs percived distance
* Exploring distance through writing as a penpal exchange with a person who lives far away from you
* distance can also be across time, short or long
* I'm diggin the idea of distance, aand the tension that I find in that as a writer and reader
* The internet made distance almost negilable: making writing and publishing easier
* Distance also can become a barrier: how easy/hard you make writing and publishing for yourself
* It also depends on the medium or difficulty as 'distance' (how formal the form is, how good do you want the end product to be)
* Words can create distance and also intimacy -- and that can change between words, sentences, pieces.
* Writing as performance: vulnerability and intimacy can change depending on how you write a piece
* Distance as 'confusion' --- how far into uninteligablity or coherence writing travels
* Internet texting patterns: using periods/all lowercase/clap emojis for emphasis as a way of creating distance, often useful, yet rarely used outside that context

=== Writing As An Art Form ===

* A painting doesn't need to have a specific meaning; it can be pretty. How does this relate to writing?
* Absurdism and expressive writing breaks boundaries 
* Some poems use line breaks as an art form in themselves: whitespace as art
* e e cummings' work / utilizing unique whitespace
** example work: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/49493/i-carry-your-heart-with-mei-carry-it-in
* comparing to the Obfuscated Perl contest which turns computer programs into weird layouts that are functional programs as well
* also are similar to early 20th C. artists who use typewriters to create art in a pointilist style, later 
* Distance created by whitespace?
** yes, distance can absolutely be implied by whitespace between words - graphic designers can use that to create meaning in a layout
* Are there bloggers that use more casual whitespace / style in blog posts?
** nocaps is seen occasionally
* Can typographical choice be an art form, however subtle?

=== Using Emojis In Writing ===

** emojis communicative effect in blog posts -- why do we / don't we use them
* Chat language patterns better represent dialogue and blogging better represents monologues
* Emojis as subtle iconography, symbolism, and potentially providing context through colors
* Emojis are colourful -- does that make them more distracting in prose?
* emoticons such as older school :D ;) etc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon <-- rather rich with history! includes notes about japanese emoticons and typographic arts dating back more than 100 years
** Seemingly these have fallen out of fashion in writing? Is it our need for more visual stimulus?
** Japanese symbolism seem to be more focused on strokes rather than visuals
* Emojis are very subjective and also sometimes difficult to commicate, as symbols have very different  meanings across cultures and contexts. What does it sound like? How can you 'translate' it?
* Poetry is often written with ambiguity in mind, so perhaps that can be an advantage of emojis
* Emojis can also provide hints to tones in writing
* An emoji as a means to convey that a statement is satirical
* What does an emoji sound like when we say it?
* Emojis have ambiguity, and meaning can change
* Technical note: emojis appear differently on different systems
* e.g,. "grimace: https://emojipedia.org/grimacing-face#designs this page shows a number of different designs across systems and time

=== The Perhaps False Dicotomy Between Visual Art & Writing ===

* The written word is literally visual -- it is / can be art (think typography!)
** Words are lines, space, negative space

=== 'Internet' Writing ===

* Obligatory mention of Gretchen McCulloch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_McCulloch and her book "Because Internet" which gets into the means of communicating on the internet and discusses that kind of ambiguity, change over time
* Amercian-centricity in use of language on the web

=== Expression Vs Interpretability ===

* Regionalisms and colloqiaul language: do you write with these? Do you make the assumption people will understand? Do you use it in context so it's clearer or provide a definition? 
* How catering does your writing need to be for your audience
* words across time https://www.bard.org/study-guides/twelfth-night-vocabularyglossary-of-terms/
* Fun of discovery in regional words
* Steven King's "On Writing" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing:_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft
** "swifties" was a word
*** https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQEAxDMyxigl4KWNU8XyjjR6OgNEt0YLH1k8w&s (I can't find a quote, but that's a photo :D)
* Three Body Problem book has footnotes to explain cultural references
** Footnotes for allusions, context, and references, but have fallen out of favor
* If the reference isn't understandable, doesn't it lose its affect?
** {{artlung}} intends to improve his usage of allusion and seek out old footnotes and give them proper annotations

=== How Words Change Over Time ===

* "semantic drift"
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change -- "Semantic change (also semantic shift, semantic progression, semantic development, or semantic drift) is a form of language change regarding the evolution of word usage—usually to the point that the modern meaning is radically different from the original usage."
*** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/euphemism_treadmill
* "Word Slut" about gender in language https://amandamontell.com/wordslut/

=== Considering (Or Not) Your Audience ===

* re: what james said about noticing when a sentence has the flavor of a cultural reference, but you don't get it: 
    ** "When I am reading a sentence in a book that references something unknown to me (as when I have inadvertently skipped a passage), I feel as though I'm reading a syntactically correct but semantically meaningless "nonsense" sentence. The sentence feels meaningful -- it has the flavor of meaning -- and the structure of its grammar thrusts me forward through the sentence and on to the next, though in truth I understand (and picture) nothing" -- 'What We See When We Read' by Peter Mendelsund
* Re: "reading too much" (our strengths are often also our weaknesses)
* Thinking about your audience is a part of being a good writer.
* How essential is a reference?
* Museum plaques sometimes introduce terms from other languages.

=== How Reading Feeds Into Writing ===

* Re-reading gives you a chance to experience something again. It's like two pieces of writing in one -- poetry especially is like this.
* Writing is different every time as a reader because you are different every time you read it.
* We may not re-read because we are looking for something new that's appropriate for the moment.
* We may read a word and then try to bring it into our work because it feels right.

=== International Understanding In Writing ===

* Digital publication allows us to share our own cultures.
* Cultures influence writing styles 
* Thanks for that perspective Sara! I suspected you would have a take on that international perspective
* Australian publishing (in English) collapsing into American settings, language and cultural references --- why is one country expected to understand another's identity when the other is exempt?
* James enjoys writing about nature, which means writing about nature in Scotland since that is where he is. I love the idea that my writing may help someone build an image of the place I live in.
* Translated blog posts

=== A Writer's Responsibility Vs A Reader's ===

* Writers' responsibility is to distill / convey
* Writing can absolutely have a goal of "challenging" the reader to an extent intended
* (I think in technical writing that's typically not the case but I'm sure there are exceptions)
* "low context culture" vs "high context culture"
* Culture of being more explicit vs. leaving more to the interpretation of the reader.
* "tl;dr" is itself a kind of alternate version
* Wikipedia has simple English that's easier to read, more limited vocabulary to allow for a broader set of people to understand
* Could more writing accomodate that kind of versions
* Choose your own adventure books!
* The seriousness with which we approach writing.
* There is also a freedom to be wild in writing, which is not at odds with approaching your writing with seriousness/conviction.
* Some of Elliots instincts remind me of Bruce Sterling's talk "The Wonderful Power of Storytelling" from 1991 https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/bruce-sterling/comp_game_designers.article/
* When blogging, we may ask "what if my [boss, parents, friends, etc.] reads this?"
* Writing for yourself, but during editing asking yourself if everything makes sense.
* The courage of writing.
