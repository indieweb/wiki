Not sure if this one has been discussed before: https://piperhaywood.com/ I dig Piper's use of tags: https://piperhaywood.com/index/

Check out this post from 2020 on her Commonplace WordPress theme: https://piperhaywood.com/commonplace-wordpress-theme/ inspired by commonplace books (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book and [[commonplace_book]])

Check out Commonplace theme on GitHub too: https://github.com/piperhaywood/commonplace-wp-theme

I also keep a curated collection of personal websites I stumble across (not necessarily all IndieWeb) via Are.na: https://www.are.na/nick-simson/the-art-of-the-personal-website

http://yooooo.ooo -> personal website alias

http://yoo.ooo -> serendipitous

^^ love both of these

TOPIC: make a post about a garden pest, then "remind me in 10 months"

TOPIC: distributed search
* shared indices
* delegate searches
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_flooding ("simple and scales very poorly" -- sounds perfect for the IW!)

I'd like to think more about how to display images on my website. Right now I have a post type called "photo," which just means that the primary content of focus is an image. I plan on having photo posts that have n photos, and even videos mixed in ("instagram style"). My general philosophy has been to define my own intended behavior, test it, and then start to mix in IndieWeb tech on my own terms, so I'm feeling like I need to imagine what I want out of these photo posts before I spend time integrating the micropub side of things for example.

ideas for gallery
* I want a sort of gallery overlay that can be opened by clicking on the image previews displayed in the post.
* Captions for each image
* Accessibility concerns for homebrew image gallery?
* I reckon I might use some Javascript to liven the experience up, but I want it to also be navigable for those who disable Javascript. Maybe I should default to a very basic flexbox of images, and then Javascript would create a slide deck of sorts if enabled
* That reminds me that I may also want to develop a sort of "slide deck" wrapper for general use, and then tailor it for image galleries, actual slideshows, zines/books

Webmentions - interested in doing emoji reactions

MicroPub - codepen/codesandbox-like posts for a micropub server, and a micropub client to develop them
Server setup - Ubuntu and Docker Compose

I've thought a bit about code formatting and text animations, which might be related to the codepen idea above:
* https://jacobhall.net/2020/code-highlighting-vim/
* https://jacobhall.net/2020/taking-notes-latex/
* I love the idea of displaying code output in a post. Maybe this could be done with RMarkdown or Jupyter, though formatting the output for your own site might be difficult.
