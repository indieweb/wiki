* Do we want to outreach to get more new-to-indieweb people to attend this?
* How do you handle concerns about backlash to discussing controversial topics?
* Should you have a plan to lock down your website and public profiles to wait till conversations cool down?
* Fast web vs slow web: easy posting interfaces can lead to faster, louder, less nuanced conversations
* community expectations for communication -- culture shock between platforms (e.g. Twitter --> Mastodon conflicts over content warnings) -- bridging between communities has "culture collapse"
* twitter threads allow people to jump in to the conversation with same authority as OP
* making comments less visible than main content can reduce incentives for negative comments
* hyperlocal information -- opportunity to pull oral history online to make it accessible -- break in oral history between pre-internet and internet generations
* value of preserving local information / archiving -- twitter records not  -- public records and private company data only required to be retained for certain periods
* social web meets civic engagement / local politics
