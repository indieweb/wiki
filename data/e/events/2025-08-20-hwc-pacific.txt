== How to choose right "right" stack? ==
* Be ready to ask the questions for what *your* needs are for *your* expectations for your website
* Hard to keep track of the capabilities of each platform and compare them fully
* Align our business needs
* Obsidian, Notion - absolutely ways to drive a website from it - content first, knowledge management
* Thomas: "It can be really important when selecting tools to first figure out how you're going to get out of it."
* Data portability: [[data_portability]]

== Knowledge Management ==
* AppSheet ~ Google Sheets
* https://help.obsidian.md/bases
** https://help.obsidian.md/bases/syntax
* Org mode.  Pointy edges everywhere, severe learning curve, but it's all yours: https://orgmode.org/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_Merer the oldest written documents are 4500 years old and essentially spreadsheets
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux
** Spreadsheets and whiteboards are core to being a human being, maybe? ({{artlung}} weakly claimed ðŸ˜‚
* "Small apps, loosely joined." Data portability means you can use different tools optimized for various use cases, e.g. organizing in Obisidian while writing in IA Writer.
