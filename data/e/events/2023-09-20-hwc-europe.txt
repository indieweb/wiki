Welcome to Homebrew Website Club!

Homebrew Website Club is a growing world-wide network of meetups for everyone who wants to take back their web experience from social media silos, and own their online identities & content, or just want support with blogging!

In the meetup, we will do a round of introductions then open the floor for you to share what they have been work on, what they want to work on, or anything else about the web that is on your mind!
