== Notes ==

We talked about [https://octothorp.es/ Octothorpes] (looks like a modern web ring) and its use during [https://weirdweboctober.website/ Wired Web October]. From a german point of view, Octothorpes doesn't seem to be [[GDPR]] compliant, though. :)

Max talked about his experience as pen & paper game master. They do sessions over normal video chat, but this has issues due to lag. So he implemented his own solution using [[WebRTC]] with a viewer and a presenter component. Players can use the viewer component, the game master starts the presenter component. You can then drag images to the presenter component, and if you click on a picture it gets pushed through a websocket to the viewer component. He encountered some interoperability issues between [[Firefox]] and [[Chrome]], the whole thing is still WIP. See the code on https://github.com/maxhaesslein/image-push.

Björn set up his own [[ActivityPub]] instance using [[GoToSocial]]. He set this up using split-domain deployment, so the server is available at ''social.stierand.org'', but the accounts are just on ''stierand.org''. He documents the still ongoing process at https://bjoern.stierand.org/notes/socialmedia/gotosocial/ and plans to move his current [[Mastodon]] account from [https://mastodon.social/users/egoexpress @egoexpress@mastodon.social] to the new account [https://social.stierand.org/@bjoern @bjoern@stierand.org].

Tilman talked about a cooperation he plans with local web hosting provider [https://hetzner.de Hetzner]. They plan to provide web space and even [[Nextcloud]] instances for all students and teachers at Technische Hochschule Nürnberg. He created a web site for this at https://join-the-web.net/ using animated SVGs.

Alex re-started application development using [[Swift]] and showed up what he's currently up to. He showed a rough draft of a workout app he's currently creating. As he stopped iOS development when Swift came along, he currently has a steep learning curve. Later he also showed up some of his latest non-IndieWeb art projects.
