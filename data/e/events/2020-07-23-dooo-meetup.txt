== Regrets ==
* [https://cogdog.info/ Alan Levine] wanted to join us, but has limited connectivity. As a consolation, he's shared a Domains-related project he's been working on: https://domains.eduhack.eu/


=== Agenda ===
* Welcome
* Introductions: short 2 minute introductions of attendees with an optional brief demonstration of something you've done on your domain or purpose for which you're using your domain.
* Group photo for those who wish to participate
* Main meetup: Ideally everyone should bring a topic, demonstration, question, or problem to discuss with the group. Depending on time and interest, we can try to spend 5-10 minutes discussing and providing feedback on each of these. If questions go over this time limitation, we can extend the conversation in smaller groups as necessary after the meetup.


== Notes ==

===Introductions ===
* Katie Hartraft

* Tim Owens has a site running Ghost 
** frequently changes systems so has an issue with linkrot over time
** Virtual VSTE 2020 site runs a SPLOT which collects resources submitted by users without an account https://vste.org/vstevirtual2020/

* Chris Aldrich
** Demo of Microsub reader, Micropub posting to his own site, and Webmention to the original site

** Getting VLE to work is taking more time

* John Stewart

** created [https://mesee.oucreate.com|a mapping website] using Google tools like sheets and AwesomeTables and embed them in our own domain via js

* Kimberly Hirsh
** UNC Chapel Hill
** Uses her site as a blog and open research/journal

** She's moving from [[MailChimp]] to something else for herself and didn't want to have to pay for it; using phpList on Installatron provided by [[Reclaim Hosting]] (uses domain name kimberlyhirsh.net on Reclaim)

* Tim Clarke (he/him)
** Instructional designer at Muhlenberg overseeing their [[DoOO]] program
** mappingreligion.website with a glossary for a textbook
** Tim Clarke here, my long-neglected personal domain is https://simulacrumbly.com.  I have a super simple but really positive use of [[WordPress]] in this past spring semester.  I co-taught a Mapping Religion with the awesome Sharon Albert.  Our class that integrated Religion Studies and Geographic Information Systems/Science.  I used the Escapade theme (https://wordpress.org/themes/escapade/),  and the A-Z Listing plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/a-z-listing/) to make our discussion work happen around the creation of a crowdsourced glossary for our readings.  I created accounts for everyone within a wordpress site on my own DoOO, and bought a $5 domain name to drop on top.  You can see the results at http://mappingreligion.website .  If you're looking to get away from the conventional discussion board in a [[Learning Management System]], and also to model how to find organizing themes and concepts across readings, this might be a fun thing to try.  Thanks! Please reach out if I can be helpful.
** Tim, Did you and your students create the map that's linked in the header also? TC: that header is borrowed from a really cool DH project, the Agas Map of Early Modern London - https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/agas.htm.  I highlighted some churches and took a screenshot for the banner of our glossary.
