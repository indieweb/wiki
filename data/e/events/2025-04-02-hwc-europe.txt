* James is working on a spot so share "moments of joy" - short phrases and sentences on things which create(d) joy
* Michael K is working on uptime stats as a result of some downtime he had which he was not notified about last week.
* How Mike K makes his oatmeal: https://michaelkupietz.com/works-in-progress/writing-works-in-progress/the-five-ingredient-cookbook/oatmeal-a-la-k/
* Joe is showcasing updates to his mixtapes page (https://artlung.com/mixtapes) that sync to his Spotify playlists
** And a /likes page with a semi-automated, CLI-based tool for sending webmentions to site authors
** And the same with /rsvp for webmention RSVPs
* Updating contact pages to use the contact means we now prefer

* Goal: make a smooth segue between each of our demos.
* James idea: /cinnamon-songs page
* From last week: Cassette control look and feel https://sheep.horse/2025/3/a_cassette_audio_control_for_the_web.html

Contact pages
* {{t}} will be updating his, dropping Skype, FBM
* see: [[contact]]
* {{t}} would prefer if he could put icons for everyone's contact pages on his mobile and use that to get in touch
* see: https://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience for more thoughts on this
* Joe doesn't like IG dms, but {{artlung}} admits that we try to communicate with people using the modes they prefer
** https://www.beeper.com/ -- a way to connect several chat networks in an app (includes better search than insta dms)
** https://www.benji.dog/contact/
*** https://www.benji.dog/verify
** https://balintmagyar.com/contact
*** Mobile view has a vCard
** https://anhvn.com/about/
*** Not a contact page but shows different "contexts"

* Joe says use separate domains if you want separate contacts for personal vs professional
* {{t}}: contact URLs should be speakable, listenable, and typable
* domains: short to type doesnâ€™t matter as much as understandability

* James has https://jamesg.blog/contact/
** It currently redirects to /email

* Why .net/... vs. .com?
* hi@ or hello@ can be confusing as an email when said to someone
* tea@tantek
* Role-based emails may be a problem where platforms may struggle like support@ or admin@

* Make sure you have DKIM /DMARC / SPIF set up to make sure your emails don't go into spam
** Recent post about those technology, some interesting conversation in the comments .https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/03/dmarc-and-spf/

* James made https://jamesg.blog/cinnamon-songs
* He wishes that there was a case-insensitive "in" operator in Python
* Python case insensitive string comparisons on StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579876/how-to-match-a-substring-in-a-string-ignoring-case

* Radio by Lana Del Rey

* Private document sharing

* https://www.are.na/ Like a combination of Tumblr & Pinterest - quiet interface, financially independent, good search engine
** {{artlung}} signed a guestbook hosted on Are.na and found it interesting
