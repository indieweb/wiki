== Notes ==
* The [[alt]] tags in the pictures - does a person uses the large language models for the description? The langauge models do not know the context, so it is easier for a person to provide the context depended description. The ALT tags can also provide the additional information, than what is on the picture.
** Example https://marksuth.dev/photos/2023/08/forth-bridge - Is it the bridge on the sunny day, or is it a specific bridge, that is a cultural monument and when the picture was taken...

* Does the post needs the title? 
** Better for the summary and extracts
** The tweet type posts do not need the title
** There is a cultural aspects - in the Tumblr it is normal ro have 1000+ words posts without the titles
** Is the example the note or a music type? (I think we were talking about this post: https://mandarismoore.com/2024/01/30/cmb-color-me.html )
