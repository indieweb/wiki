** "Writing into the void"
** Articulating your thoughts is always useful
** It can be nice to have readers who give feedback / start conversations
** https://tracydurnell.com/2024/12/01/gift-to-the-indie-web-i-will-edit-your-blog-post/

** https://www.netgalley.com/
** https://booksirens.com/
** In the event I attended today they described writers exchanging manuscripts for feedback as "beta readers"
* https://turner.enemyterritory.org/user/carrvo/index
** could use comparisons for workflow: https://turner.enemyterritory.org/shared/repo/user/carrvo/webpages/Journey-to-MIndie.html
** (sign in as anonymous and the link will explain more as to why that limitation is there)
* James note: I really should get back to my HTML element of the day project.
** Being open to edit others' blog posts?
** James has found it helpful to share blog posts with people to build confidence that something is worth publishing.
* {{artlung}} added redirects from /tea and /coffee to https://artlung.com/starbucks/
** James has https://jamesg.blog/starbucks too!

** You can email any of the people below to ask for feedback on a blog post (if you attended the meeting):

* Oat review blog - "oat-vote.com"
* Dual language websites
** Brandon has English and Spanish on his website
** Some browers have automatic translation features that users can enable
** Q: When you translate posts, does it make you think more about the post contents?

Thinking about removing box shadow filters

** inset came up

* The web is viewed in all kinds of different ways; by people in light mode, dark mode; people with full vision, partially sighted, blind; people on a train, people at home.
** It is unlikely your website will be seen by everyone exactly in the way you design.

* Cookies, bread rolls, and regional understandings of concepts
** Jaffa Cakes were determined to be a cake in the eyes of the US authorities by proving that the food went hard when stale rather than soft.
** https://myanimelist.net/anime/28/Yakitate_Japan

* Challenge: come up with a song that embodies your favourite web browser.
* "Surfin' Safari" Beach Boys (Joe in California)

** https://www.benji.dog/articles/my-favorite-mugs/

* Michael demo'd a Star Trek cup where the characters fade/show as warm water is added / water cools.
* The first webcam was of a coffee pot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy
** Does the IndieWeb wiki have an equivalent? Webmention page?
** https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/
*** https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/?source=kevin+bacon&target=Philosophy
*** https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/?source=coffee&target=IndieWebCamp
*** "Found 189 paths with 4 degrees of separation from Coffee to IndieWebCamp in 4.14 seconds!"
*** You can, for example, get from IWC to Coffee by: IndieWebCamp -> Lightning talk -> Aristotle -> Europe -> Coffee
*** "plonk"

* https://github.com/crgimenes/neko
** "cat" google easter egg
*** James' equivalent would be clicking and leaving a coffee stain

* https://www.techdif.co.uk/

* plonk http://catb.org/jargon/html/P/plonk.html
** It's still in Wiktionary! https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plonk
** Internet Archive last copy before deletion: https://web.archive.org/web/20210804203828/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plonk_(Usenet)
*** Interestingly, Etherpad doesn't include the last ) in the link, so you have to add it manually.
**** Auto-linker bug. Classic.
** Book that uses "plonk" in prose without defining it: https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Rough_Guide_to_the_Internet/umvBESswHH8C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=plonk+usenet&pg=PA242&printsec=frontcover

* Letterboxd imports into our websites
** You can parse the RSS and upload to your website

* If you follow an RSS feed and a Mastodon feed, you may see the contents twice.
** Do we have a wiki page on solving this problem?
*** Related to responses but same idea applies to a feed: [[deduplication]]
