'''<dfn>export</dfn>''' (specifically, <dfn>How to export your data</dfn>) in the context of the indieweb refers to the ability to download some or all of your data from a site, typically from a [[silo]], though also for CMS or site [[migration]].

Many [[silos]] offer the ability to download a copy of some of/all of your data. If this is of a high enough quality, it can be used as the basis of an indieweb site, or be imported into an existing indieweb site.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Indiewebcamp Creators who have imported previously siloed content into their own sites:

* [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] imported all his old [[Twitter]] content and (?) some of his [[Tumblr]] content into tommorris.org
* [[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] imported all his old [[Diaspora]] content into waterpigs.co.uk/notes
* {{snarfed}} imported many of his old [[Facebook]] posts with [https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/facebook_to_wordpress.py facebook_to_wordpress.py] after he started POSSEing. [http://snarfed.org/2012-11-30_facebook_to_wordpress Details.]
* {{chrisaldrich}} has exported his data from [[WordPress.com]], [[Tumblr]], [[Twitpic]], and [[Posterous]] to [[import]] back into his own personal website. He's also exported data from [[Twitter]], [[delicious]], and others for future import potential.
* In July 2018 {{cleverdevil}} created a [[micropub]] tool to export data from his wife's [[Facebook]] account and import it to [[micro.blog]].

== Code to assist with data export/import ==

* [https://github.com/barnabywalters/diaspora-export diaspora-export] — a python script for downloading all of your public Diaspora content (as the diaspora exporter doesn’t include your posts for some reason)
* [http://freedom.io freedom.io] transfers your siloed posts to a blog or cloud storage provider with structure and formatting intact, including comments, pictures, tags/mentions, links, etc. It's ''very'' immature and incomplete, especially the UI, which is horrible, but the functionality largely works. It migrates from [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]], and [[Instagram]] to [[Dropbox]], [[Tumblr]], [[Blogger]], or [[WordPress]] (self hosted and .com).
