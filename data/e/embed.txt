{{stub}}

'''<dfn>embed</dfn>''' is code (usually just HTML like an iframe, sometimes with [[JavaScript|JS]]) for showing content from another website on your website or inside a post that is included by viewer’s browser and typically has some interactive aspect (more than a static [[photo|image]] / [[audio]] / [[video]] file).

Related spec:
* [[rel-embed]]

== Why ==
There are lots of reasons to embed content (transclude) from another website into your posts. E.g. some common use-cases:
* Embedding a [[note]] (or a [[tweet]] or [[toot]]) as a pull-quote or citation
* Add a CC-licensed image from Flickr to your post to illustrate a point
* ...

== How to ==
=== How to display other embeds ===
Use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or similar markup recommended by the person (or service) publishing the original content you want to embed.

* If you use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag to embed, be sure to provide accessible alternative text in its <code>aria-label</code> attribute (see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label MDN docs], [https://dev.opera.com/articles/ux-accessibility-aria-label/#accessible-name-calculation dev opera article]) as it’s better for alt text than the <code>title</code> attribute which has other presentational effects.

* If you want to explicitly mark up your embeds for discovery, indexing, etc., use [[h-cite]] to to indicate the presence of the embed, with at least a <code>u-url</code> on the element that does the literal embedding of the content, e.g. <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.

(actual minimal HTML + h-cite example would be good here)

WARNING:
* DO NOT use properties like <code>u-photo</code> or <code>u-video</code> on an embedding element without wrapping it in an h-cite. Doing so associates that content directly with your own <code>h-entry</code>, which presumably lists you as a <code>p-author</code>, thereby erroneously claiming that you took and/or own the content being embedded which is unlikely if you are embedding it from another site.

=== How to publish embed URLs ===
Publish URLs to embed versions of your permalinks at similar URLs, e.g. a canonical permalink suffixed with <samp>/embed</samp>.
	
To enable <span id="rel_embed_discovery">rel embed discovery</span> on post permalink pages:
* link from a post permalink to the embed thereof with <code>rel=embed</code> e.g.:
** <code>&lt;link rel="embed" href="{permalink}/embed" /&gt;</code>
** where {permalink} is the post permalink URL

On each embed page:
* put [[rel-canonical]] on the link back to the postpermalink, e.g. the linked published (or updated) datetime.

=== How to discover embed URLs ===
{{main|rel-embed}}
Consuming code should look for a <code>rel</code> with <code>embed</code> value and use that to auto-discover the embedding URL to present as a UI to publishers etc.

Do you support such "embed" URLs on your site? Add yourself below!

Sorted roughly by date implemented/published (write a blog post about it when you implement it and cite that!)

=== Benji ===
{{benji}} -- Support by adding '''/embed''' to any post, since 2024-10-24. See https://www.benji.dog/notes/1729739188/ 

=== Kupietz ===
{{kupietz}} -- Support by adding '''/embed''' or '''?embed''' to any post or page, since 2024-10-30. Renders content without any Wordpress template features (more accurately, renders it using a template that consists solely of a call to the '''the_content();''' function within the Wordpress loop.) Also implements '''?title''', '''?author''', and '''?tags''' URL parameters to optionally include post title, author, and/or tags in embed content. See https://michaelkupietz.com/?p=10887 (As an example, this page includes "The Infinity Iframe", an iframe embed of its own content. Don't follow it too far down or you may never return. Also: addresses some apache Content Security Header configuration concerns, also mentioned below in [[#Content_Security_Policy_Rule_Concerns_—_Mike_Kupietz|Brainstorming — Content Security Policy Rule Concerns]].)

=== Add yourself! ===

== Service Examples ==
=== LibreFM ===
{{mat.tl}} -- added embeds to [[libre.fm]] permalinks since 2024-10-23, see https://github.com/foocorp/hacienda/issues/53
* 2024-10-27 blog post announcing the embed feature: https://blog.libre.fm/2024/10/libre-fm-blog-launches-update-for-october-27th-2024/

== Software Examples ==
=== Mastodon ===
Since version (???), Mastodon supports putting <kbd>/embed</kbd> on the end of a post permalink to retrieve an ultra-minimal (no JS required) HTML version of a post, suitable for embedding via an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.

Examples:
* Mastodon 4.3.x: https://indieweb.social/@brettk/111413186987516565/embed (unfortunatley now [[js;dr]])
* Mastodon 4.2.x: https://social.coop/@mattl/112018447716032177/embed (with actual text content marked up with HTML)

{{needs-screenshots}}

== Embedding Examples ==
Good and interesting examples of embedding content from others.
=== The Guardian ===
When The Guardian embeds a TikTok video, they show a consent banner in place of the embed, that allows you to opt-in to load that specific TikTok video.

[[File:theguardianembed.jpeg|200px]]

=== BBC ===

When the BBC embeds a Tweet (and media from other sites [citation required]), they show a consente banner. You must opt in to load the third-party embedded media before it renders on the page.

== Silo Issues ==
=== tracking ===
When you embed a resource from a silo inside a post on your site, your are exposing people using your site to being tracked by that silo.

=== Instagram ===
* AVOID Instagram’s embed code because adding it will lower your page ranking due to norobots from IG https://www.seroundtable.com/google-warns-about-instagram-embeds-indexing-28036.html
* ^^^ more details: https://twitter.com/glenngabe/status/1160881702211936256
** "Via @johnmu: Switch from normal embedded images to Instagram embeds & see a big drop in image search traffic? That's because IG uses iframes & the meta robots tag using noimageindex. That's a big problem. John tested this & I just ran a quick test too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm7mn2sGuyw&t=29m38s" [https://www.gsqi.com @glenngabe] August 12, 2019

=== Twitter ===
(stub)

As of 2022-??? Twitter tweet embeds show awkward empty blocks when the tweet is deleted.

== Brainstorming ==
=== HTML fragment embed markup ===
What is the minimum necessary for the HTML at an embed URL?

Perhaps just a <code>&lt;div class="h-entry"&gt;</code> with visible properties for:
* author (name, photo)
* content (or summary)
* date published/updated hyperlinked to u-url permalink (with also [[rel-canonical]] perhaps for converse discovery)

Needs full example.

==== brainstorming idea #1 from {{lazcorp}}  ====
<code>&lt;blockquote class="h-embed" cite="https://example.org/permalink-url/embed"&gt;
&lt;div class="h-entry"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>

# basic markup - a blockquote element containing the above content (author name, text content, date of publication) as of the time of embedding, marked up with relevant microformats, and a URL to the {permalink}/embed URL in the cite attribute - this content is visible in embedding site even if embedded site dies
# Embedding site can choose to implement some JavaScript that overwrites some/all embedded content by fetching the latest content (inc. embedded images/media) available at {permalink}/embed URL, perhaps in an iframe inside the blockquote element
# Embedding site can choose to to implement some JavaScript to pull in extra metadata (replies/likes/reposts, profile pic, last updated date, CSS/style info etc) from {permalink}/embed URL 

This puts the level of trust of the live content of the embedded site in the hands of the embedding site.

An implementation could display the basic markup by default (what the embedder was actually mentioning/quoting/replying to at time of embedding) and present an option to the reader to view the enhanced version (latest updated version, remote content such as images, etc) at the click of a link via JS or choose to display the current version from the embeddee's site by default (and display a JS link to view the original version, if they choose).

=== redirection to embed rather than framebusting ===
If your site supports embed versions of your posts:

Instead of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framekiller framebusting] someone using an iframe to embed one of your permalinks, use such framing-detection techniques to redirect framing of your post permalink to the embed of that permalink!

=== How to embed content from other sites ===

Thoughts and concerns about embedding:
==== site death ====
* If the site supplying the embedded content dies, what should remain visible on the site embedding that content? 

{{lazcorp}}: I'd suggest author name, summary/text content (no remote images or media), date published/updated, and the hyperlink

==== live updates concerns ====
* Potential problems with live updates of embedded content

From [https://blog.dave.org.uk/2015/04/quoted-by-the-daily-mail.html Quoted by the Daily Mail]

<blockquote>"You can’t edit the content of tweets once they had been published. But you can change some of the material that is displayed – specifically your profile picture and your display name.

So, over lunch I took a few minutes to create a new profile picture and I changed my display name to “The Mail Lies”. And now my tweet looks how you see it above. It looks the same on the Mail article.

...

So remember boys and girls, publishing unfiltered user-generated content on your web site is always a dangerous prospect."</blockquote>

=== Standards on including title/tags? by {{kupietz}}  ===

Should there be a standard as to whether an embed includes or title (and maybe tags) in the embedded content, or just the content? Obviously, with something like embedding a tweet, title is irrelevant. But embedding a post, title and tags are relevant. Should there be a recommended standard? I'm thinking, for simplicity, we should say embeds are content only, and title and tags are metadata.  Wonder what others think though, whether this is even worth having a recommended standard on or not. UPDATE: Perhaps moot. I've implemented these, and author, as optional URL parameters.

=== Content Security Policy Rule Concerns (Embedded Content site) — {{kupietz}} ===

I had some issues today that I thought were germane enough to the topic to be worth mentioning here. 

After getting the stuff described higher up on the page implemented, I realized my CSP rules were blocking iframe embeds of the content I was specifically advertising as embeddable. I didn't want to open my whole site up to iframing, so I wanted to set up some rules in .htaccess to check the URL and allow '''frame-ancestors *''' ''only'' for urls ending in '''/embed/''' or containing an '''?embed''' parameter, the two ways I'd chosed to make the embed content accessible. Well, long story short: the obvious (simplest) way to do this was to replace my .htaccess file's original <code>Header set Content-Security-Policy "[all my original rules]; frame-ancestors 'self'" </code> line with:

<pre>    
<If "%{REQUEST_URI} =~ m#embed# || %{QUERY_STRING} =~ m#(?:^|&)embed(?:&|$|=)#">
Header set Content-Security-Policy "[all my original rules]; frame-ancestors 'self' *"    
</If>    
<Else>    
Header set Content-Security-Policy "[all my original rules]; frame-ancestors 'self'"    
</Else>    
</pre>    

(I actually used <code>m#/embed/#</code> for the first regex but I'm trying to show the simplest-case example here.)

Well, as it turns out, this is ''wrong, wrong, wrong'' because of an apparent bug in apache mentioned at https://processwire.com/talk/topic/23000-apache2-blocks-dont-work-with-regex-matches-against-the-request_uri-variable/ which says that <code><If></code> blocks don't work with <code>%{REQUEST_URI}</code> (actually, that page says regex comparisons don't work, but even direct string comparisons didn't work for me). 

The fix was pretty simple: compare against <code>%{THE_REQUEST}</code> instead of <code>%{REQUEST_URI}</code>. The regex had to be slightly different as there's more characters in <code>%{THE_REQUEST}</code> after the URL, but it was trivial, I just used <code><If "%{THE_REQUEST} =~ m|/embed/?(?:[ ?#])| || %{QUERY_STRING} =~ m#(?:^|&)embed(?:&|$|=)#"></code> (Much appreciation to {{gRegor}} for spotting this, as well as {{lazcorp}} for putting some cogitation in as well.)

Hopefully this will save someone in the future the five consarned hours I spent trying to figure out what in sam hill was going on with this thing today.

=== Content Security Policy Rule Concerns (Embedding Content site) — {{lazcorp}} ===

After considering the above from {{kupietz}} it should also be noted that it's not just the embedded-content-owner's CSP rules that need opening up, but also those on the site that is embedding the content.

For example, I have the frame-src directive restricted to just a handful of sites that I allow to embed content (archive.org, vimeo, and a few others).

I'd either have to add new domains to the frame-src directive every time I wanted to embed a piece of content from a site I hadn't embedded content from before, or I'd have to drop any frame-src restrictions altogether, with all the security implications that come with that.
