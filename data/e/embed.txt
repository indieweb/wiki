'''<dfn>embed</dfn>''' is code (usually just HTML like an iframe, sometimes with JS) for showing content from another website on your website or inside a post that is included by viewer’s browser and typically has some interactive aspect (more than just a static image / audio / video file).

== Why ==
There are lots of reasons to embed content (transclude if you fancy yourself a fancy hypertexter) from another website into your posts. E.g. some common use-cases:

* Embedding a [[tweet]] as a pull-quote or citation
* Add a CC-licensed image from Flickr to your post to illustrate a point
* ...

== How to ==
* At a minimum, just use the recommended iframe or similar markup recommended by the person (or service) publishing the original content you want to embed.

* If you want to explicitly mark up your embeds for discovery, indexing, etc., use [[h-cite]] to to indicate the presence of the embed, with at least a <code>u-url</code> on the element that does the literal embedding of the content, e.g. img or iframe.

* If you use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag to embed, be sure to provide accessible alternative text in its <code>aria-label</code> attribute (see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label MDN docs], [https://dev.opera.com/articles/ux-accessibility-aria-label/#accessible-name-calculation dev opera article]) as it’s better for alt text than the <code>title</code> attribute which has other presentational effects.

(actual minimal HTML + h-cite example would be good here)

WARNING:
* DO NOT use properties like <code>u-photo</code> or <code>u-video</code> on an embedding element without wrapping it in an h-cite. Doing so associates that content directly with your own <code>h-entry</code>, which presumably lists you as a <code>p-author</code>, thereby erroneously claiming that you took and/or own the content being embedded which is unlikely if you are embedding it from another site.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{section-stub}}
No known examples of personal sites providing special "embed" URLs of [[post permalink]]s for others to embed in their posts or other web content.

Do you support such "embed" URLs on your site?

== Software Examples ==
=== Mastodon ===
Since version (???), Mastodon supports putting <kbd>/embed</kbd> on the end of a post permalink to retrieve an ultra-minimal (no JS required) HTML version of a post, suitable for embedding via an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.

Examples:
* Mastodon 4.3.x: https://indieweb.social/@brettk/111413186987516565/embed (unfortunatley now [[js;dr]])
* Mastodon 4.2.x: https://social.coop/@mattl/112018447716032177/embed (with actual text content marked up with HTML)

== Embedding Examples ==
Good and interesting examples of embedding content from others.
=== The Guardian ===
When The Guardian embeds a TikTok video, they show a consent banner in place of the embed, that allows you to opt-in to load that specific TikTok video.

=== BBC ===

When the BBC embeds a Tweet (and media from other sites [citation required]), they show a consente banner. You must opt in to load the third-party embedded media before it renders on the page.

== Silo Issues ==
=== tracking ===
When you embed a resource from a silo inside a post on your site, your are exposing people using your site to being tracked by that silo.

=== Instagram ===
* AVOID Instagram’s embed code because adding it will lower your page ranking due to norobots from IG https://www.seroundtable.com/google-warns-about-instagram-embeds-indexing-28036.html

** "Via @johnmu: Switch from normal embedded images to Instagram embeds & see a big drop in image search traffic? That's because IG uses iframes & the meta robots tag using noimageindex. That's a big problem. John tested this & I just ran a quick test too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm7mn2sGuyw&t=29m38s" [https://www.gsqi.com @glenngabe] August 12, 2019

=== Twitter ===
(stub)

As of 2022-??? Twitter tweet embeds show awkward empty blocks when the tweet is deleted.

== Brainstorming ==
=== rel embed discovery ===
Modest proposal for publishing:
* link from a post permalink to the embed thereof with <code>rel=embed</code> e.g.:
** <code>&lt;link rel="embed" href="{permalink}/embed" /&gt;</code>
** where {permalink} is the post permalink URL

Consuming code would look for a rel with <code>embed</code> value and use that to auto-discover the embedding URL to present as a UI to publishers etc.

=== HTML fragment embed markup ===
What is the minimum necessary for the HTML at an embed URL?

Perhaps just a <code>&lt;div class="h-entry"&gt;</code> with visible properties for:
* author (name, photo)
* content (or summary)
* date published/updated hyperlinked to u-url permalink (with also [[rel-canonical]] perhaps for converse discovery)

Needs full example.

==== brainstorming idea #1 from {{lazcorp}}  ====
<code>&lt;blockquote class="h-embed" cite="https://example.org/permalink-url/embed"&gt;
&lt;div class="h-entry"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>

# basic markup - a blockquote element containing the above content (author name, text content, date of publication) as of the time of embedding, marked up with relevant microformats, and a URL to the {permalink}/embed URL in the cite attribute - this content is visible in embedding site even if embedded site dies
# Embedding site can choose to implement some JavaScript that overwrites some/all embedded content by fetching the latest content (inc. embedded images/media) available at {permalink}/embed URL, perhaps in an iframe inside the blockquote element
# Embedding site can choose to to implement some JavaScript to pull in extra metadata (replies/likes/reposts, profile pic, last updated date, CSS/style info etc) from {permalink}/embed URL 

This puts the level of trust of the live content of the embedded site in the hands of the embedding site.

An implementation could display the basic markup by default (what the embedder was actually mentioning/quoting/replying to at time of embedding) and present an option to the reader to view the enhanced version (latest updated version, remote content such as images, etc) at the click of a link via JS or choose to display the current version from the embeddee's site by default (and display a JS link to view the original version, if they choose).

=== redirection to embed rather than framebusting ===
If your site supports embed versions of your posts:

Instead of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framekiller framebusting] someone using an iframe to embed one of your permalinks, use such framing-detection techniques to redirect framing of your post permalink to the embed of that permalink!

=== How to embed content from other sites ===

Thoughts and concerns about embedding:
==== site death ====
* If the site supplying the embedded content dies, what should remain visible on the site embedding that content? 

{{lazcorp}}: I'd suggest author name, summary/text content (no remote images or media), date published/updated, and the hyperlink

==== live updates concerns ====
* Potential problems with live updates of embedded content

From [https://blog.dave.org.uk/2015/04/quoted-by-the-daily-mail.html Quoted by the Daily Mail]

<blockquote>"You can’t edit the content of tweets once they had been published. But you can change some of the material that is displayed – specifically your profile picture and your display name.

So, over lunch I took a few minutes to create a new profile picture and I changed my display name to “The Mail Lies”. And now my tweet looks how you see it above. It looks the same on the Mail article.

...

So remember boys and girls, publishing unfiltered user-generated content on your web site is always a dangerous prospect."</blockquote>
