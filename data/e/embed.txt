'''<dfn>embed</dfn>''' is code (usually just HTML like an iframe, sometimes with JS) for showing content from another website on your website or inside a post that is included by viewer’s browser and typically has some interactive aspect (more than just a static image / audio / video file).

== Why ==
There are lots of reasons to embed content (transclude if you fancy yourself a fancy hypertexter) from another website into your posts. E.g. some common use-cases:

* Embedding a [[tweet]] as a pull-quote or citation
* Add a CC-licensed image from Flickr to your post to illustrate a point
* ...

== How to ==
* At a minimum, just use the recommended iframe or similar markup recommended by the person (or service) publishing the original content you want to embed.

* If you want to explicitly mark up your embeds for discovery, indexing, etc., use [[h-cite]] to to indicate the presence of the embed, with at least a <code>u-url</code> on the element that does the literal embedding of the content, e.g. img or iframe.

(actual minimal HTML + h-cite example would be good here)

WARNING:
* DO NOT use properties like <code>u-photo</code> or <code>u-video</code> on an embedding element without wrapping it in an h-cite. Doing so associates that content directly with your own <code>h-entry</code>, which presumably lists you as a <code>p-author</code>, thereby erroneously claiming that you took and/or own the content being embedded which is unlikely if you are embedding it from another site.

== Silo Issues ==
=== Instagram ===
* AVOID Instagram’s embed code because adding it will lower your page ranking due to norobots from IG https://www.seroundtable.com/google-warns-about-instagram-embeds-indexing-28036.html

** "Via @johnmu: Switch from normal embedded images to Instagram embeds & see a big drop in image search traffic? That's because IG uses iframes & the meta robots tag using noimageindex. That's a big problem. John tested this & I just ran a quick test too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm7mn2sGuyw&t=29m38s" [https://www.gsqi.com @glenngabe] August 12, 2019

=== Twitter ===

As of 2022-??? Twitter tweet embeds show awkward empty blocks when the tweet is deleted.
