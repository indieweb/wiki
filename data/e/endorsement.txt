An '''<dfn>endorsement</dfn>''' is the approval/support of someone or something, typically used to endorse someone's skills in an area.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} started experimenting with endorsements by manually POSSE-ing an endorsement for a colleague on [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/07/17/2/reply/ 2018-07-17] to LinkedIn.
** The approach for this first post was to treat the endorsement as a public reply to the other person's URL (in this case LinkedIn profile since it was a POSSE and the person didn't have a personal domain).
