'''<dfn>egg</dfn>''' is either a reference to an [[easter egg]] or the default profile [[icon]] on [[Twitter]] from September 2010 until 2017-03-30 which was abandoned because it had become associated with [[troll]]s and [[bot]]s.

* 2017-04-04 WIRED: [https://www.wired.com/2017/04/rip-twitter-eggs-video/ RIP, Twitter Egg. It Was Good Knowing You, However Anonymously] / With the social-media platform killing off its infamous avatar, we pay our respects to the departed. <blockquote>â€¦ the egg's super-harassy reputation, which has only grown during its seven-year life. So good job, Twitter! Way to change the abstraction that people associate with drive-by racism and spammy group DMs!</blockquote>
