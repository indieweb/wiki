'''<dfn>Expiring content</dfn>''' is content that is only temporarily (ephemerally) relevant, and also part of a larger post, that can and should be (preferably automatically) removed once a particular datetime has passed (the expiration date).

== Why ==
=== Why ephemeral content ===
Why post ephemeral content? 

If you're writing a post that has both long term relevance, and bits that only matter in the immediate day or perhaps week afterwards, it makes sense to designate / markup those bits as ephemeral content, and have your site automatically remove them or switch to something else after the fact.

=== Why ephemeral posts ===
Why publish an ephemeral post?

From existing examples, there appears to be two types of ephemeral posts:
# Posts that expire as of a particular date and time due to no longer being relevant after that time (e.g. discounts, invitations, announcements)
# Posts that expire within a certain period of time after posting (e.g. 24h like [[Snapchat]]).

The first are similar to the ephemeral content example above.

The second type of ephemeral post, popularized by the [[Snapchat]] silo and copied by [[Instagram]] [[story|stories]] and others, seems to make it easier to "just post" something without worrying as much about presentation, details, refinements, since there is an expectation that it won't be (publicly) archived/shown/discovered for all time.

== Real World Needs Examples ==
Examples of IndieWeb sites/posts with content that would benefit from automatic expiry.

=== Tantek ===
This post: http://tantek.com/2014/308/b2/my-first-year-november-project#half-marathon-hills-track has a couple of pieces of temporal content I would have liked to have expire automatically:
* " (Reminder: NovemberProject 2014 Yearbook Photos Are Tomorrow!) " - an entire paragraph I'd have liked to have disappear automatically once the referenced event had passed.
* "hopefully this Sunday at the Berkeley Half. " - have it expire and be replaced by a placeholder of some sort until I update it with my finishing time and other info.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Last.fm ===
[[Last.fm]] allows one to set [[jam|jam-like]] posts. Any [[scrobble|scrobbled]] song can be set as a current obsession which will be shown on the user's profile page similar to a [[pinned post]]. Current obsessions can be deleted or changed at any time, but are set to automatically [[expiring_content|expire]] within a week.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Creating ===
What would be a good way (UX) for the user to select and indicate that some content should be expired when?
=== Storage ===
What would be a good way to store that certain sections of content should be expired?
=== Updating ===
What would be a good way(UX) for the user to select and indicate that some content should be replaced by some other content automatically when?
