'''<dfn>explore</dfn>''' is a common feature of [[social media]] sites and [[silos]], often display on a [[search]] page by default or sometimes on a [[home page]], that typically displays popular content and trends on a site, or in some cases (like [[Mastodon]] instances), posts across connected sites that users on a site are interacting with ([[reply]]ing or [[react]]ing to).

* to-do: figure out overlap & differences with [[discovery]], and document that in both places, cross-linking accordingly
* Service example: https://indieweb.social/explore (and perhaps most/default Mastodon instances)
* Software example / issue: Mastodon under some conditions will show an "empty" /explore page with nothing but placeholder text stating "Nothing is trending right now. Check back later!", despite there being recent posts on the instance, and from other servers followed by users on the instance.
