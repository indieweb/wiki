'''<dfn>Email</dfn>''' is a decentralized, non-web messaging transport, with user interfaces that enable a wide range of message formats and styles, and commonly used for [[account recovery]] by web sites and [[application]]s.

== Why ==
Email can be <span id="Use_cases">useful</span> for:
* Asynchronous posting to your website.
* A [[POSSE]] destination to reach people who use email as a reader

Older reasons to use email:
* One on one or one to many [[messaging]] among older internet users, some professions, and academia.
* Messaging to a (often self-)selected group, i.e. [[email list]]

== How to ==
(stub)
=== How to POSSE ===
How to POSSE to email:

This section is a stub. For now, see the [[#IndieWeb_Examples|examples]] below and analyze how individuals are POSSEing from their personal sites to email.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Indiewebcamp creators currently posting to their sites via email, and/or POSSEing to email:
=== Nick Doty ===
{{npdoty}} occasionally publishes emails on bcc.npdoty.name that he also sends to mailing lists since [http://bcc.npdoty.name/Re-programmatic-typesetting 2009-01-22], e.g.:
* http://bcc.npdoty.name/Re-programmatic-typesetting
* he also occasionally publishes emails sent to an [[email list]]

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] has been posting to his site occasionally via email [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1441/ since 2013-05-22]. Example:
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1441/

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has occasionally syndicated posts from his site to email lists since [https://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/11/18/1/ 2014-11-18]. Example:
* https://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/11/18/1/

=== ... more posting POSSEing here ... ===

=== PESOS ===
It's also possible to [[PESOS]] your email that you send to people or [[email list]]s to your own site. Examples of IndieWeb creators that have PESOSed email to their site.

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has at least once PESOSed an email sent to co-workers, to his own site, with some bits redacted for public consumption, [http://tantek.com/log/2004/06.html#d29t1850 since 2004-06-29]:
* http://tantek.com/log/2004/06.html#d29t1850


== Support ==
Due to its popularity and ubiquity email is extremely widely supported.
=== Application integration ===
Of particular interest is the fact that many native applications (especially on iOS) include it in their share/export/action menus by default. This could be an excellent UI to piggyback on for quick and easy posting to our own sites.

=== Webmention ===
[[questo.email]] is an indieweb/email bridge that aims to be a hub for all kinds of interactions between indie sites and email addresses, including email-to-webmention and webmentions-to-email.

__TOC__

== Brainstorming ==
=== Redirect to public issues ===
One possible approach is to redirect incoming email to public issues, hosted on your own site, or [[GitHub]], per:

* http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/01/07/1/email-lifehack <blockquote>I wonder what would happen if I set an email auto-responder that instructed people to open an issue on github.com/aaronpk/self instead of send me an email. #email #lifehack</blockquote>

== Criticism ==
=== Bad for more than two people ===
Whilst adequate for some one to one conversation it scales extremely badly to conversations with more than two people. 
=== Bad for collaboration ===
It is also appallingly bad for collaboration ([[wiki]]s or version control systems are much better for this[http://microformats.org/wiki/wiki-better-than-email]).

=== Not web ===
* URLs == web
* email addresses != web.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-08-21/line/1377127301]
=== Not web identifiers ===
* email addresses are internet identifiers, not web identifiers, by definition.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-08-21/line/1377127333]
=== Maintenance disinterest ===
* "I would rather futz with a domain and shared hosting than my own SMTP server any day"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-08-21/line/1377129620]
=== Bad for identity ===
* [[Why_web_sign-in#Why_not_email|Why not email for identity]]
=== Encourages Constant Distraction ===
* http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/opinion/end-the-tyranny-of-24-7-email.html

=== Unreliable Delivery ===
Email delivery, especially with your own domain, has shown to be anecdotally unreliable due to overzealous spam filters' false positives, e.g.: https://twitter.com/dangillmor/status/579770619367170049 <blockquote>Is there a way to find out if my email is ending up semi-routinely in spam filters? Several folks recently said they didn't get my messages</blockquote>

=== Ecosystem discriminates against indie servers ===
The email server ecosystem has evolved to a small handful of very large (100s of millions of accounts) services that peer with each other, and are actively hostile to indie servers sending their own mail with the excuse that those indie servers lack "reputation" (an ineffable an ill-defined requirement) for the larger servers to accept email from them.

For more details see:

== FAQ ==
'''Can I point my domain to my VPS(/web server) but still use hosted email services? I don’t want to run a mailserver'''

Yes, your domain name can resolve to the IP address of your web server for HTTP traffic, but direct mail agents to look elsewhere. See also [[DNS]].

== Email Services by Type ==
Here are various levels of email services available from different providers, roughly ordered from easiest/cheapest/friendliest to most powerful/technical. 

=== Custom domain email providers ===
Custom domain email providers have the ability to set up an email account to send email as if it is from your own personal domain. 

You have to separately configure your domain (perhaps at your DNS provider or [[web hosting]] provider) to forward domain sent to your domain (e.g. example@example.com) to whatever email provider you use.

Advantages:

Disadvantages:
* ...

IndieWeb community members using this approach: 
* [[User:Jonnybarnes.net|Jonny Barnes]] is using Fastmail's service for receiving/reading/sending jonnybarnes.net emails. Fastmail works by setting up a custom domain as an alias for your fastmail inbox.
* [[User:Tantek|Tantek Çelik]] is using Gmail for receiving/reading/sending tantek.com emails.
* {{kylewm}} is a Fastmail user too. They recommend letting fastmail be your actual nameserver, but I opted to continue using my registrar's nameserver and just copy/paste MX, DKIM, and SPF records from Fastmail.
* {{voxpelli}} is using Soverin for his newest set up domain and an old free G-Suite/Google Apps account for his other account (also using a calendar on the G-Suite account).
* ...

Specific services:

==== Gmail ====
{{main|Gmail}}
[[Gmail]] (gmail.com run by [[Google]]) is a free email service that has the ability to set it up to send email as if it is from your own personal domain, optionally using the SMTP server from your domain host ([[web host]]).

==== FastMail ====
[[FastMail]] is a paid email service that has a range of options from only giving you a @fastmail address to others that allow you to have your own personal domain. Other differentiators are with how much email you can store.

==== Pobox ====
[[Pobox]](http://pobox.com/pricing) is a paid email service that has two types of accounts: mailstore and forwarding. All of their plans allow for personal domains.

==== Zoho Mail ====
[[Zoho Mail]](https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html) has a free account plan that allows you to receive mail in your own domain (1 per account, in the free plan).

==== Pawnmail ====
[[Pawnmail]](https://pawnmail.com/) is a service dedicated to provide "Email hosting for custom domains" that gives 2GB storage "free forever" to anyone. It provides a webmail client along with SMTP, IMAP and POP3 access.

==== Soverin ====

[[Soverin]](https://soverin.net/) is a paid one-plan only email service that provides a "private mailbox that’s truly yours". It's a European service, based in Amsterdam, that focuses on privacy and making it simple to get up and running with e-mail on a personal domain. Makes it easy to conf

=== Mail as a Service ===
==== Mandrill ====

Mandrill is a service for sending and receiving emails run by Mailchimp. It formerly had a generous free plan, but will require a paid MailChimp account [http://blog.mandrill.com/important-changes-to-mandrill.html beginning 2016-04-27] and paid e-mail volume, now starting at [https://mandrill.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217467117 30$ a month].

Greyed-out information below probably not correct any more -> '''if you still use Mandrill, please update it!'''
<div style="color:#aaa;">
'''Note''': Madrill '''does not charge''' for inbound email. See: https://twitter.com/sandeepshetty/status/463330411636994048

# Register at http://mandrillapp.com
# Create a new inbound domain and set up MX records for the domain you’ve chosen [http://help.mandrill.com/entries/21699367-Inbound-Email-Processing-Overview detailed here]
# Set up your web server to accept POST requests to the URL you configured
#* Make sure you verify the origin of the request as detailed [http://help.mandrill.com/entries/23704122-Authenticating-webhook-requests here]. You can see the key for your webhook [https://mandrillapp.com/settings/webhooks here]
#* The format of the POST request is detailed [http://help.mandrill.com/entries/22092308-What-is-the-format-of-inbound-email-webhooks- here]. Send some test emails to yourself and store the results to learn about the format

Beware: I have experienced some inconsistencies in the mandrill responses. Namely that sometimes attachments are in the msg.attachments key, but I have also seen them in msg.images. I am currently using <code>attachments = msg.attachments || msg.images || []</code> to cater for both cases. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 10:26, 24 May 2013 (PDT)

==== Other Inbound Email Providers ====

There are other email PaaS companies which offer similar inbound POST request hooks instead of using Mandrill. More details coming soon.

* MailGun - [http://mailgun.com] 
* PostMark - [http://postmarkapp.com]
* Comparison of several providers - [https://github.com/opennorth/multi_mail/wiki/Incoming-email-APIs]

=== Mail Forwarding Services ===

Advantages:
* The service provider handles all of the issues that are involved with mail delivery such as spam filtering, DKIM and SPF support and will also cache your mail if your MTA goes offline
* ...
Disadvantages:
* You still need to setup a MTA to receive the email being forwarded by the vendor
* ...

IndieWeb community members using this approach: 
* [[User:Bear.im|Bear]] is using MailRoute for receiving/sending bear.im emails.
* ...

==== MailRoute ====

[http://mailroute.net/services.html MailRoute] allows you to specify its mail servers in your domain's MX records and then specify what server domain or IP Address to forward sanitized emails to. It offers spam filtering, greylisting and a number of other features. Once you have an account and have configured it for your domain you are then ready to setup your local MTA.

=== Handling it Yourself ===

==== Mail in a Box ====
[https://mailinabox.email Mail in a Box] is a script that [http://razor.occams.info/ Josh Tauberer] has put together to turn a VPS into a functioning mail server.

==== Running your own mail server  ====

A MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) is a process that runs on your server and accepts incoming SMTP (port 25 generally) connections for mail delivery. Running your own MTA is fraught with trouble and can be so very time consuming that even people who run servers for a living generally use a forwarding service to handle all of the messy bits.

The example I give here will be to use Mailroute as the forwarding service and Postfix as the local MTA, but other combinations can be used.

*Note* this is a draft work-in-progress - I'll be filling in more concrete examples and other suggestions as I get time.

I use Postfix primarily because it comes from all of the OS Distros with a very sane set of defaults that you enter during setup and it just works. The reason Postfix becomes a drop-in tool is because of the work that is being done by the Mail Forwarder you setup in the prior step.

The key bits to configure is to tell the installer that you are using Postfix as "[http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html#stand_alone Stand-alone Internet Host]" and then make sure the main.cf entries for mydestination contains your domain and relayhost contains the domain name for your Mail Forwarder.

===== Indieweb examples =====
[[User:Petermolnar.eu]] had been running his own mail stack; the current setup is postfix ( with postscreen ) + dovecot + dspam + opendkim + opendmarc.
A few tutorials on petermolnar.eu about the topic:
* [https://petermolnar.eu/howto-spf-dkim-dmarc-postfix Getting DKIM, DMARC and SPF to work with Postfix, OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC] 
* [https://petermolnar.eu/debian-lightweight-mailserver-postfix-dovecot-dspam/ Lightweight, secure, database-free, spamfiltering mail server with Postfix, Dovecot, openDKIM and dspam on Debian 7]

=== Security Issues ===

Anyone can send fake email from any email address. You need some way of determining that inbound email does indeed come from who it appears to. Possible solutions include:

* Make sure you’re verifying the authenticity of the request sent to your webhook
* Using “secret” email addresses by embedding the password in the address, e.g. myreallysecurepasswordorrandomkey@example.com — then store it in a private address book to save typing
** [[Flickr]] does this - to let you upload [[photos]] by email - and the email address are pretty short too.
* Use a mechanism such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework SPF] to determine the authenticity of an email

==== phishing ====
'''<dfn>phishing</dfn>''' is the act of sending an email (a <dfn>phish</dfn>) with both a forged from address and HTML contents that pretend to be from a popular service provider (often [[silo]]), and usually have some sort of fear-invoking subject like "Account Termination", or greed-invoking like "Transfer Notification" from a bank, with a link or button to "Log in", "Verify Account", "Initiate Transfer" which appears to go to the service provider but actually goes to an attacker's website that looks very similar (if not identical) to the service provider in order to trick you into entering your username and password, so the attacker can gain access to your service provider account.

The term "phish" comes from the attacker "fishing" for your username and password, which if you enter,  then you've been "<dfn>phished</dfn>".

E.g. (documented examples of phishing emails)
* [[Apple ID]]: https://bear.im/bearlog/2017/297/apple-phishing-email.html
* ...

==== spearphishing ====
'''<dfn>spearphishing</dfn>''' is the act of tailoring a "phish" specifically for a particular individual, sometimes seeming to come from a trusted contact, friend, co-worker.

== As Commenting ==
In 2015, when shutting down their comment section, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/section/tech Motherboard] recommended people to take discussions to email rather than getting them burried in public discourse:

<blockquote>Comment sections inspire quick, potent remarks, which too easily veer into being useless or worse. Sending an email knowing that a human will actually see it tends to foster thought, which is what we want.</blockquote>
