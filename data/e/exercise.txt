'''<dfn>exercise</dfn>''' is a (typically) ''passive'' [[post]] type that represents some form of physical activity. Its content is often similar to a [[note]] or can easily be represented as plain text.

__TOC__
=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses his open source HTML+CSS+JS [http://waterpigs.co.uk/pushups/ Pushups web app] (download to clone) to track (nose touch activated) and post (via [[Taproot]]'s [[micropub]] support) pushups as a [[note]] variant to waterpigs.co.uk since [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SYJit/ at least 2013-10-14]. Example:
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SYJit/

=== Aaron Parecki ===
==== Pushups ====
{{aaronpk}} uses his open source [http://marvelouslabs.com/pushup-counter pushup-counter iOS app] to track (nose touch activated) and post (via [[p3k]]'s [[micropub]] support) pushups to aaronparecki.com (through [[p3k#Pushups]]) since [http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2013/11/28/143242/ at least 2013-11-28](or earlier?). Example:
* http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2013/11/28/143242/

==== Runs / Walks / Bike Rides ====
* [http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2014/08/10/070547/ bike ride]
* [http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2014/08/21/063245/ run]
* [http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2014/04/07/075930/ walk]

==== Sleep ====
Sleep isn't really exercise, but I wasn't sure where else to list it. Example:
* http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2014/08/25/070033/

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has posted some [http://boffosocko.com/tag/exercise/ exercise related posts with a particular exercise tag] and data as [[checkins]] at a particular exercise location. On [http://boffosocko.com/2018/03/18/exercise-morning-walk-with-the-dog/ 2018-03-18] he enabled the Exercise post type within [[Post Kinds Plugin]] to create exercise specific posts which he keeps at http://boffosocko.com/kind/exercise/. 

=== John Johnson ===
[http://johnjohnston.info John Johnson] maintains a [http://johnjohnston.info/walks/ list of walks] he takes including gps data and photos. He describes on the page his set up for posting them.

== POSSE ==
See [[microsyntax#metrics_and_exercise]] for some ideas on how to POSSE exercise posts into plain text destinations.

A POSSE service exists for the many exercise silos called [http://tapiriik.com Tapiriik] - which has an interesting option to put all your "activities" into Dropbox as TCX files (a Garmin file format that covers activity, calories burned, altitude, etc that's captured from a variety of devices).  It also pushes activities to other silos.  It would be interesting to add Micropub to their sync services.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Jawbone ===
[[Jawbone]]'s [[API]] has a lot of stuff:
* https://jawbone.com/up/developer/endpoints

=== MapMyFitness ===
[[MapMyFitness]] has an app and website:
* [[MapMyRun]], mapmyrun.com which claims to be able to aggregate fitness posts/activities from nearly all other fitness silos, and then provides access to them with an API.
**  https://www.mapmyapi.com/Standard_API
** It may be interesting to explore mapmyrun.com to [[PESETAS]] fitness information and then use their open API to feed it all into your own site.

=== Nike ===
[[Nike]] has various fitness tracking applications (iOS, Android, ???)
* [[Nike+]] Running
* ...

=== Strava ===
[[Strava]] tracks bicycle rides and runs.

It's possible to setup Strava to push into Jawbone
* [[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] is doing this since ????-??-??

Strava allows you to download an export of all your data, which includes all the trips as individual [[GPX]] files.

Before GPS recording on the app one can choose between 'Run' and 'Ride' modes. After uploading you can choose the following exercise type names: 
* Ride, Run, Swim, Hike, Walk, AlpineSki, BackcountrySki, Canoeing, Crossfit, EBikeRide, Elliptical, IceSkate, InlineSkate, Kayaking, Kitesurf, NordicSki, RockClimbing, RollerSki, Rowing, Snowboard, Snowshoe, StairStepper, StandUpPaddling, Surfing, VirtualRide, WeightTraining, Windsurf, Workout, Yoga

=== RunKeeper ===
[[RunKeeper]] tracks bicycle rides and runs and other types of exercise.

=== Apple ===
[[Apple]] appears to be adding a "Health" API for iOS to centralize health & exercise related activities:
* http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5772074/apple-healthkit-ios-8-announcement

=== Fitbit ===
[[Fitbit]] make a number of fitness/activity trackers.

* [http://dev.fitbit.com/ Dev program]
* [https://www.fitbit.com/export/user/data Export] lets you get XLS or CSV data for your own personal account for food, exercise/activity, sleep and body/weight data.
* [[ifttt]] has [https://ifttt.com/fitbit Fitbit triggers]

=== Tapiriik ===
[http://tapiriik.com/ Tapiriik] is an open source syncing software. Because of it‚Äôs purpose of syncing across multiple silos it has a set of ‚Äústandard attributes that might be useful while deterring mf2 for exercise posts. The attributes Tapiriik tracks are:
* StartTime (similar to h-event)
* EndTime (similar to h-event)
* Name (standard mf2 title attribute)
* Notes (standard mf2 content)
* Type
* Distance (experimented in with [[trip]])
* Stationary
* Private (would be used through Micropub visibility Extension)

== Challenges ==
* Too much hassle (AKA "high friction data collection") http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/10/28/1/low-friction-personal-data-collection
* Miles vs kilometer: how do you display your runs and rides?
** On silos like [[Strava]], the display of the distance is based on the user's preferences. A visitor on an IndieWeb website will just see the distance that is preferred by the publisher (owner of the site). Might be solvable with [[Microformats]] in a [[reader]], but harder on the site itself.

== Brainstorming ==
Some brainstorming about exercise posts, including simple text-only syntaxes that could be used in notes:

=== Step Tracking ===
Syntax: number-of-steps #steps anything-extra

Examples:

* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes?tagged=steps

==== BMI Tracking ====
Syntax: number #bmi

Examples:

* http://evan.status.net/tag/bmi

== Issues ==
=== Privacy ===
Depending on what device you use and circumstances, you may not own the data, and it may be retrievable by others to then infer (or disinfer) other things about you:
* 2015-06-29 [http://fusion.net/story/158292/fitbit-data-just-undermined-a-womans-rape-claim/ Fitbit data just undermined a woman‚Äôs rape claim] <blockquote>For Risley, fitness-tracking may have backfired, tracking something she didn‚Äôt necessarily want committed to the record. It‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll see more Fitbits being trotted out in court in the future, as the wearable trend takes hold, and self-tracking leads to self-incrimination.</blockquote>

== Sessions ==
IndieWebCamp sessions about exercise and other physical activities.
* [[2012/Quantified_Self]]
* [[2012/UK/Hosted_API]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== Specific Exercise Types ===
You may want to post and display different kinds of exercise differently, and thus give them specialized post types that are like an exercise post but with more specific details
* üö∂ walk
* üèÉ run
* üö≤ bicycle
* üõ¥ scooter
* üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è yoga
* ...
