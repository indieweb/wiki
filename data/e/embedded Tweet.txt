An '''<dfn>[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-embed-a-tweet embedded Tweet]</dfn>''' is the display of a [[tweet]] on a website other than Twitter, though with a similar presentation, and typically some ability to interact with the tweet directly. .

== Why ==
Embedding a tweet provides a UX familiar to users of Twitter, and is less surprising for authors of tweets when they see their tweet on a site other than Twitter.

== How to ==
See Twitter's instructions:
* https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-embed-a-tweet

== IndieWeb Examples ===
=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} uses embedded tweets to show them in [[reply-context]]s since YYYY-MM-DD, e.g.:
* (needs link to a snarfed.org reply to a tweet)

== Silo Examples ==
=== Substack ===
[[Substack]] supports embedding tweets in posts by pasting in the tweet URL. Notably, the visual style for the embedded tweet does not rely on [[javascript]] being enabled.

From the [https://on.substack.com/p/how-to-use-the-substack-editor?s=r How to use the Substack editor] documentation:

<blockquote>To embed a tweet, Instagram photo; YouTube or Vimeo video; Spotify, SoundCloud, or Bandcamp audio track; or GitHub Gist, just paste the relevant link on a new line (don’t grab the embed code; it won’t work).</blockquote>

Javascript was disabled for this screenshot:
