'''<dfn>OwnYourSwarm</dfn>''' is a service which sends your [[Swarm]] checkins to your own website via [[Micropub]].

== Why ==
Swarm has nice native mobile apps for checking in, so if you're already a user of those, it's quite convenient to setup OwnYourSwarm to post your checkins automatically to your own website!

Posting your checkins to your own website (instead of just on Swarm) has all the usual [[ownyourdata]] benefits.


== How to ==
* See https://aaronparecki.com/2017/03/19/7/day-89-ownyourswarm for links and information on setting up OwnYourSwarm to post to your website.

== Where ==
https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io

== Person Tags ==
OwnYourSwarm detects when a checkin has [[person-tag|person tags]], and then passes those along in the Micropub request. The person-tags are sent as JSON h-cards, including the Swarm user's first name as reported by the service, along with the profile photo of the user. If the tagged user also uses OwnYourSwarm, then their own website URL is used in addition to their Swarm profile URL.
