'''<dfn>OpenAI</dfn>''' is the creator of many notable AI tools, including an Embeddings API and the GPT series of models that, combined, can be used to create a generative search index for your website.

== How To ==

You can create a chatbot that generates answers to questions about content on your website using OpenAI's Embeddings API and GPT models. GPT-3.5-turbo performs well for this purpose, and for a lower cost than prior generative text models offered by OpenAI.

<blockquote>
I use Facebook's faiss vector store for storing the embeddings.

I then keep a JSON file that maps the index associated with each embedding in the faiss store with a record I create during data ingestion. That record includes a URL at minimum and may also include a title, a date, and other meta info.

I ingest my:

* blog posts
* docs from libraries I have written
* personal wiki pages
* breakfast and coffee wiki pages
* readmes for all my public github repos
* my bio
* and some technical writing I have done
