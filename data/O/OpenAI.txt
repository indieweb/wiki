'''<dfn>[https://openai.com/ OpenAI]</dfn>''' is the creator of many notable AI tools, both for users like ChatGPT, and APIs for developers that can be used to create a generative search index for a personal website, that at least one community member has implemented.

== How To ==

You can create a chatbot that generates answers to questions about content on your website using OpenAI's Embeddings API and GPT models. GPT-3.5-turbo performs well for this purpose, and for a lower cost than prior generative text models offered by OpenAI.

<blockquote>
I use Facebook's faiss vector store for storing the embeddings.

I then keep a JSON file that maps the index associated with each embedding in the faiss store with a record I create during data ingestion. That record includes a URL at minimum and may also include a title, a date, and other meta info.

I ingest my:

* blog posts
* docs from libraries I have written
* personal wiki pages
* breakfast and coffee wiki pages
* readmes for all my public github repos
* my bio
* and some technical writing I have done
