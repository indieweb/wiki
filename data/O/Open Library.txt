'''<dfn>[https://openlibrary.org Open Library]</dfn>''' is an [[Internet Archive]] project to create a page for every book, and provide cover images and the ability to borrow or [[read]] as many as possible.

== How To ==
=== Build an ISBN link ===
If you would like to link books you mention to their page on Open Library, append the ISBN to:

<pre>https://openlibrary.org/isbn/</pre>

This should work with either ISBN-13 or ISBN-10. Open Library will redirect to their permalink for the book using their own internal ID. 

In some cases, a book may not be on Open Library yet, but you can add them. See [[#Edit pages]].

=== Edit pages ===
You can sign in with your [[Internet Archive]] account to edit pages on Open Library.

See the Open Library FAQs: https://openlibrary.org/help/faq/editing#editing-rights

=== Import / Export ===
The library allows for [[import]] of one's [[Goodreads]] reading lists: https://openlibrary.org/account/import as well as downloading a .csv export of your reading list.

=== Scan Barcodes ===
OpenLibrary has a browser-based, mobile-friendly barcode scanner in beta at: https://openlibrary.org/barcodescanner

== IndieWeb Examples ==
