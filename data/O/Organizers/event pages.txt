https://indieweb.org/Organizers/event_pages

Event pages on the wiki have been a source of friction, but replacements have also been difficult. This page tracks various efforts and discussions on how to improve this.

== 2018 meetup pages update ==
Proposal: Give individual meetups in individual locations individual pages, which are easier to edit and create. Automate weekly roll-ups and links in various locations. Decision to test this at [[2018/Berlin/Organizers]].

=== 2018-11-07 ===

{{aaronpk}}, {{schmarty}} and {{sknebel}} prepared examples:

* Instead of https://indieweb.org/events/2018-11-14-homebrew-website-club there's individual pages for events that week: [[events/2018-11-13-homebrew-website-club-baltimore|Baltimore]], [[/events/2018-11-14-virtual-homebrew-website-club|Virtual]] and [events/2018-11-14-homebrew-website-club-sf|San Francisco]]. 
* a weekly summary page at https://indieweb.org/events/2018-11-2nd-week-meetups
** example for a page for a past week, with images/articles: https://indieweb.org/events/2018-10-3rd-week-meetups
* new display on /[[Events]], pointing now to individual pages (tiny hidden h-cards for days with multiple events - again, the intention is to automate this)
** <div class="h-event">'''<span class="dt-start">2018-11-13</span> <a class="u-url p-name" href="/events/2018-11-13-homebrew-website-club-baltimore">ðŸ¦€ Homebrew Website Club Baltimore</a>'''<br/>Where: Digital Harbor Foundation, Baltimore, MD<br/>Join us for an evening of quiet writing, wiki editing, IndieWeb demos and discussions! </div>
** '''[[events/2018-11-2nd-week-meetups#Wednesday.2C_14th|2018-11-14 IndieWeb Meetups]]'''<br/>Where: <a class="h-event" href="/events/2018-11-14-virtual-homebrew-website-club">Online<data class="dt-start" value="2018-11-14"></data></a>, <a class="h-event" href="/events/2018-11-14-homebrew-website-club-sf">San Francisco<data class="dt-start" value="2018-11-14"></data></a><br/>Join us for an evening of quiet writing, wiki editing, IndieWeb demos and discussions!

=== ToDos ===
* actually automate this
* Frontpage HWC box (already maintained by [[Kaja]]) needs to understand new format
* decide on per-city archives
* iCal feeds?
