Event pages on the wiki have been a source of friction, but replacements have also been difficult. This page tracks various efforts and discussions on how to improve this.

== Venue-specific HWC pages proposal ==
Proposal: Give individual meetups in individual locations individual pages, which are easier to edit and create. Automate weekly roll-ups and links in various locations. Decision to test this at [[2018/Berlin/Organizers]].

=== 2018-11-07 ===

{{aaronpk}}, {{schmarty}} and {{sknebel}} prepared examples:

* Instead of https://indieweb.org/events/2018-11-14-homebrew-website-club there's individual pages for events that week: [[events/2018-11-13-homebrew-website-club-baltimore|Baltimore]], [[events/2018-11-14-virtual-homebrew-website-club|Virtual]] and [[events/2018-11-14-homebrew-website-club-sf|San Francisco]]. 
* a weekly summary page at https://indieweb.org/events/2018-11-2nd-week-meetups
** example for a page for a past week, with images/articles: https://indieweb.org/events/2018-10-3rd-week-meetups
* new display on /[[Events]], pointing now to individual pages (tiny hidden h-events for days with multiple events - again, the intention is to automate this)
** <div class="h-event">'''<span class="dt-start">2018-11-13</span> <a class="u-url p-name" href="/events/2018-11-13-homebrew-website-club-baltimore">ðŸ¦€ Homebrew Website Club Baltimore</a>'''<br/>Where: Digital Harbor Foundation, Baltimore, MD<br/>Join us for an evening of quiet writing, wiki editing, IndieWeb demos and discussions! </div>
** '''[[events/2018-11-2nd-week-meetups#Wednesday.2C_14th|2018-11-14 IndieWeb Meetups]]'''<br/>Where: <a class="h-event" href="/events/2018-11-14-virtual-homebrew-website-club">Online<data class="dt-start" value="2018-11-14"></data></a>, <a class="h-event" href="/events/2018-11-14-homebrew-website-club-sf">San Francisco<data class="dt-start" value="2018-11-14"></data></a><br/>Join us for an evening of quiet writing, wiki editing, IndieWeb demos and discussions!

=== ToDos ===
Some of these are open questions - reply inline or discuss in #meta, thank you!

* actually automate this
** rollup pages: work in progress, running manually right now
*** support timezones for order, show for virtual (show common alternatives to?)
*** allow manually edited sections, e.g. "what to discuss!" - basically, only edit generated sections, leave others alone
** /[[Events]]
*** use [[Template:one-day-event]] for adding HWC entries when they only have one city that day
** Frontpage HWC box (already maintained by [[Kaja]]) needs to understand new format
** What's [[Template:Homebrew_Website_Club]] supposed to look like now? still dayly links, pointing to section on aggregate page?
* This should probably be open source somewhere
* how to mark up and display virtual events
** until now, they had p-location "Virtual Americas" or "Virtual on CET" which got copied over instead of city, which works but sounds wrong. 
** current plan: Category:Meetups/Virtual, call "Online" by default
*** how to handle multiple on same day?
** potentially support vendor-prefixed microformats class for shorthand (p-iww-short-name, {{aaronpk}} suggested p-nickname (not yet in h-event))
** potentially accept and copy an emoji-prefix on the name
* Error reporting?
** extra page that gets edited with not-hidden edits provides low-key notification in IRC?
** add notice sections to pages?
* decide on per-city archives
* iCal feeds?
** {{gRegor}} has https://github.com/gRegorLove/mf2-to-iCalendar
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CategoryWatch ?

==== done ====
* basic rollup pages can be generated, but manually triggered and little backend intelligence
* CSS to make "external" internal links hidden deployed globally: https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?oldid=53835&rcid=53704

== Events Issues ==
(section imported from Organizers page)
=== Mediawiki awkward for events ===
One of our more awkward uses of MediaWiki is using it as an events calendar. 
=== Multiple places to update ===
* Adding an event like an IndieWebCamp or Homebrew Website Club involves updating several locations
** Home page list of events needs to be updated manually
** Events on [[events]] are updated manually
** [[Template:IndieWebCamp|IWC]] or [[Template:Homebrew_Website_Club|HWC]] templates are updated manually
** /next-iwc and /next-hwc redirects are updated manually

=== Creating new HWC pages is tedious ===
* Copy+pasting to create new HWC pages is tedious, and is typically only done [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-01-27/line/1453947587493 by Gregor and Tantek]
* Entering all the HTML required to format the page as an h-event is error prone

=== Wiki pages require manual RSVP ===
* Not easily able to add new features like accepting [[RSVPs]] to the wiki pages themselves

=== Event pages need better presentation ===
* The event pages look like wiki pages, with little visual hierarchy, and are not immediately recognizable as an event you can RSVP to to the general public

== Event Brainstorming ==
(section imported from Organizers page)

=== Events Problem Statements ===
* Lots of manual work to create / update events on indieweb.org (most often for [[Homebrew Website Club]], updating [[Events]], [[Main_Page]], and [[Sidebar]].
* Group event sites are hard, especially ones that take into account any particular community's needs

=== Events Non-goals ===
* Just changing the plumbing. Just changing the plumbing has pretty much no positive (likely more negative) effect on usability. E.g. (just "let's use jekyll for that")
* Just replace the editing UI / wiki mark-up/down syntax. E.g. the "simple web interface" benefit of jekyll is actually more complicated than the current wiki which is also a web interface. I.e. if all you're doing is replacing wiki markup with markdown, it's not a benefit. mediawiki: wiki syntax + mediawiki templates. jekyll: markdown + yaml blocks and includes. they're not actually that different.
* "learning one more system" = worse overall UX.
* Aspirational new system proposed by non-users of current system. The "I won't use the existing system because I hate wikis" argument is not a good argument, as absence of use of a current system provides no evidence that any new system would gain any use at all.

=== Events Replacement Requirements ===
Capturing here from IRC, some thoughts on possible requirements for any proposals to improve / replace entirety of how we create / update events on the IndieWeb.org site itself.

* '''Maintenance commitment up front.''' Volunteers to build a new system should also consider volunteering to maintain it, otherwise it's just trading one (known) maintenance tax (updating multiple places in the wiki, annoying, but simple/easy that anyone can do it), for another (unknown) maintenance tax (updating/fixing software, likely much harder, means it doesn't get done).
* '''Try and learn current system first.'''  Volunteers to design/build/replace events should at least *try* actively updating / creating events on indieweb.org so that they have some direct first-person understanding of the needs of the community. Without that first-hand knowledge, any such proposal is likely ignorant of the community's actual needs.
* '''Start with UI/UX sketches.''' Anything any of us want to build to replace the wiki events should start out with UI/UX sketches, no code at all.
* '''Support your own indie events first.''' Group events software is so much harder / more complex than indie [[event]] / [[RSVP]] posting support (likely a superset of), that that would make a good prerequisite for any proposals/proposers.

=== Separate Events Site ===
We used 2016.indieweb.org for the [[2016]] IndieWeb Summit. The [http://2016.indieweb.org IndieWeb Summit 2016] event page was an initial attempt at creating a more friendly format for our events. 

We have also set up 2016.indieweb.org/nyc2 for [[2016/NYC2|IndieWebCamp NYC2]].

Possibilities for expanding use of a separate site for events. 
* Continue with YYYY.indieweb.org
* New subdomain events.indieweb.org

==== Some events options to consider ====
* keep using YYYY.indieweb.org for annual summits, and YYYY.indieweb.org/CITYABBR for specific IndieWebCamps
* build our own minimal event interface 
* adopt an existing running project such as [[Calagator]] 
* wait for an in-progress project such as [[Dark Matter Eventer]]

==== Events Requirements ====
(not comprehensive) 
* Some level of unstructured content on event pages, so that we can allow our use of it to continue to evolve over time.
* Be able to quickly duplicate an event rather than set up recurring events (like Calagator's "clone" function)
* Events must support multiple locations and varying start times and timezones per location (our HWC events do this currently)

==== Events Ideas ====
* Quickly add links to posts (notes, photos, articles) about an event
* Highlight photos from events
** Upload photos directly to the wiki or event page
** By retrieving linked photos in indieweb photo posts / tweets / instagram posts
* RSVP via Webmention like http://2016.indieweb.org
* RSVP directly on the page (an "I'm Going" button after you're logged in)

==== Tickets and Registration ====
For the past couple years, we've had a separate ticketing website for letting people register/buy tickets to the events. We've found that having an explicit step of acquiring the ticket leads to better no-show rates. In 2016, the attendance rate of people who RSVPd from their website was 73%, vs that of people who bought a $5 ticket was 39%.

There isn't any value gained by having the registration system outside of the main event page, so integrating them would certainly be a good goal. Here are the features of the registration system that have been useful.

* Accepting payments for tickets.
* Issuing "tickets" in a way that feels stronger than just RSVPing for the event.
* Collecting the person's email address
* Providing a way to contact them before the event, such as sending reminders leading up to the event.

==== Other community events examples ====
* WordCamps, which have many properties in common with Indiewebcamps
** Uses wordcamp.org (likely derived from barcamp.org), a TLD different from the community: wordpress.org
*** Philosophy: a main landing page and using subdomains for the individual events, with year/location. 
*** Making wordcamp.org itself the page for upcoming events
*** Use subdomains on wordcamp.org for specific events
*** Issues: they had an issue with [https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/09/29/switching-back-to-the-original-wordcamp-urls/ URL structure] last year.
