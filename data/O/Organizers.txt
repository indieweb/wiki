https://indieweb.org/Organizers

'''<dfn>Organizers Meetups</dfn>''' (and <dfn>Organizers Summits</dfn>) are half-day events for everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] or was active organizing [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups in the past two years. Due to the spread-out nature of our community, many attend remotely.

These meetups were formerly called <dfn>Leaders Meetups</dfn>. At the [[2018/NYC/Organizers|2018 NYC Organizers Meetup]] organizers decided to rename them to avoid the sound of elitism or intentional hierarchy; and because we want to encourage anyone to become an organizer!

== next ==
The participants in the [[2017/Organizers|2017 Organizers Summit]] (before [[2017|IWS]]) decided that more frequent (than yearly) Organizers Summits could be beneficial.

The next [[2018/Organizers|Organizers Summit]] is 2018-06-25, a day before [[2018|IndieWeb Summit 2018]].

If you're [[planning]] an IndieWebCamp between now and the next summit, and want to organize an Organizers Summit beforehand, drop a heads-up here linking to your IndieWebCamp's planning page with details about a proposed Organizers Meetup.

=== Future Meetings ===
[[2017/Organizers#future_meetings|Previous Organizers Summit session]]

{{martijnvdven}}: I think we discussed doing it quarterly, or at least three times a year aligning with major IWCs, at the last Organizers Summit. This still makes a lot of sense to me. Though maybe it has been failing because planning an actual get together the day/night before an event is hard, and we should decouple it from the “major IWC” mark?

[[2017/Organizers#Discussion_Channels|Previous Organizers Summit session]]

'''which channel for WordPress development'''
* There has been a little discussion about this again lately. As the appeal of the WordPress plugins is growing, more non-gen1 people turn up to #-wordpress looking for help setting things up. To not alienate these people, development talk has shifted back into #-dev.
* User support is nice in #-wordpress, as the main channel is mostly active with gen1-type people on their own custom workflows who can be of little help to WordPress setups. The people who do run WordPress are probably in #-wordpress and happy to help there.
* WordPress plugin development, especially if multiple devs are online, can quickly fill up all of #-dev. This was one of the original reasons there was a fork into #-wordpress: [[2017/Organizers#Discussion_Channels]] so we should stick with that. If there's a need for separate WP channels for WP users vs WP devs, we can consider that.

=== IndieWeb Community Infrastructure ===
* What services are essential for running the IndieWeb community resources, and who has access to them?
** Content
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[wiki]] [https://github.com/indieweb/wiki available on GitHub].
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[discuss|chat]] logs [https://github.com/indieweb/indieweb-chat-archive available on GitHub].
** Domain name(s)
*** Who has access to <code><nowiki>indieweb.org</nowiki></code>, can configure the DNS, etc?
*** How can access to these be split amongst several people?
** Communication
*** Who can manage the [[Slack]] server / channels?
*** Who can manage the [[IRC]] channels?
**** It looks like we have several <code>+o</code> people. Are they all listed as Founders or equal on ChanServ?
**** all ops are in US timezones and thus not available on EU mornings (discussed 2017-12-17 due to small spam-wave on Freenode)
**** Is there anything to gain from [https://freenode.net/groupreg registering with Freenode]? (or has this been done already?)
*** Is there any managing we have to do for the [[Matrix]] bridge?
*** How quickly could a new Slack bridge be created if [[Loqi]] goes down? The bridge code is [https://github.com/aaronpk/Slack-IRC-Gateway available on GitHub].
** Official channels
*** Again, who has access, and what are the backups?
*** There is an official [[Twitter]]: [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp]
*** There is an official [[GitHub]]: [https://github.com/indieweb/ IndieWeb]
** For projects we depend on, e.g. the Slack bridge, should they be mirrored to the indieweb GitHub account? That way the community has them even if the original author decides the remove their repository.
** Third parties we depend on? Can more of these be self-hosted?
*** Currently the wiki login only works through [[IndieAuth.com]].

=== Kid Friendliness ===
For IWC organising, is it interesting to state kid friendliness somewhere?

=== Evaluate barrier of entry to wiki / wiki use-case ===
Added by: {{martijnvdven}}

This came up in relation to diversity, mostly regarding how accessible the community is to new entrants. Please read the discussion in [[discuss#Chat_Channels|the #indieweb-meta chat channel]] from [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-01#t1535814753677600 2018-09-01, 15:12 UTC], to [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-01#t1535821711745500 about 17:08]. Some choice bullet points and quotes:

* {{aaronpk}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-01#t1535814753677600 asked Jon] if they could add their feedback on [[diversity]] to the wiki. This is a relatively common thing within the community to do: putting stuff on the wiki is [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-01#t1535815252429300 an established workflow], and so is asking others to contribute to the wiki.
* Jon pointed out that this adds some definite barrier of entry for people. They had to go [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-01#t1535817206298700 through multiple steps] – taking a good 20 minutes – to add something to the wiki. Something they had already thought to have communicated through chat.
** <blockquote style="border-left:5px solid #c8ccd1;margin-left:20px;padding-left:20px">The barrier restricts participation to the current non-diverse group of insiders. The default response of “put it on the wiki” immediately confronts outsiders people with this barrier. I’ve talked with more than one person who checked out the Indieweb chat room and had the reaction that it was a really hostile place because of this and so decided not to get involved.</blockquote>
** <blockquote style="border-left:5px solid #c8ccd1;margin-left:20px;padding-left:20px">the situation was somebody (me) who’s not in the core Indieweb community had some suggestions about how to make it more diverse. The response was to ask me to put it on the wiki. Requiring IndieAuth is a barrier to the group getting suggestions from a outside the core. No matter what the purpose of the wiki is, that’s going to be a problem for diversity</blockquote>
* {{martijnvdven}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-01#t1535821219335100 feels that] the solution depends on whether the wiki is meant for this type of feedback or not. And that the barrier to entry should be adjusted depending on that.
** <blockquote style="border-left:5px solid #c8ccd1;margin-left:20px;padding-left:20px">my point is that the solution to the situation depends on us deciding what the wiki is for. Either we lower the barrier for wiki edits, or we stop asking people who aren't assimilated in to the community to put their feedback on the wiki.</blockquote>
* {{aaronpk}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-01#t1535821266527900 clarifies that] the existing barriers (mainly the [[IndieAuth]]/[[RelMeAuth]] requirement) are there by design.
* {{martijnvdven}} is especially interested in hearing from Organizers who have helped onboarding new users on the wiki. {{t}} and {{jgmac1106}} come to mind.
* The wiki used to be the way to register for IWC, so this barrier made sense to help restrict  to [[creators]] or their apprentices. At [[2016]], we started selling tickets so this wasn't a barrier for IWC. Currently, I think this barrier primarily serves to keep spam off the wiki. I'm open to the idea of opening registration to the wiki somehow. I know that's probably not trivial and makes more work for organizers (some coding to make regular + IndieAuth sign-in work, moderating spam accounts), but maybe it's worth it? <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/3473/profile-2016-med.jpg}}  [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 22:19, 2 September 2018 (PDT)

=== Evaluate if/how to apply Code of Conduct for outside events ===
What do we do if someone shows up at an IndieWeb event who has done things ''outside of IndieWeb events'' that would be considered a violation of the [[CoC]]? There was some discussion at lunch after [[2018/Organizers]] and then occasionally in #meta <sup>[chat log links needed]</sup> about this.
* [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-09-02 2018-09-02]: What would we do if it was reported that someone had been harassing others via their own site or a federated service like [[Mastodon]]?

=== Promoting Events ===
{{t}}: Let's improve how we promote our events, towards goals of:
* increasing participation overall
* especially increasing [[diversity]] of participation
* especially increasing breadth of [[generations]] represented

Some ideas:

* Set dates farther in advance
** e.g. for IWS [[2020]], set dates *before* IWS [[2019]], and at least a venue/date confirmed *before* next year's XOXO for the *next* IWS (2020)
** Design, print, distribute "save the date" postcards
*** e.g. during IWS and XOXO where people are motivated to plan a trip back to Portland ASAP
*** or without a date/venue, and get people to put their address on them and offer to mail them out when we know the date & venue!
** The sooner we can send "save the date" announcements/card, the sooner that folks interested can blockout the dates on their calendar so that when it *does* come to decision time months later, they find they have the time to go (and have not accidentally scheduled something else that weekend)
* Make postcards to hand out in person
** 1. designer for "save the date" post cards
** 2. printing a whole bunch of them in full color
*** we could also create a *physical mail* sign-up list for people to receive post-cards when we know the date and print cards later.
** 3. pre-stamp cards for mailing said post cards to said people signed-up
* Participate in diverse events (like [[XOXO]]) and hand out "save the date" post cards etc.
** [[XOXO]]
** WordCamp
** ... other diverse and broad [[generations]] spectrum events for creatives
* "Save the date" stamp to stamp the backs of stickers, along with the classic "library date" stamp for start-end dates!
** allows cheap just-in-time re-use of existing generic IWC sticker stock, and customizing for any event in the future as soon as its dates are known!
* ...

Thoughts?
* ...

== planning considerations ==
* Location requires good internet for streaming
* Some kind of conference room microphone or professional videoconference setup (Mozilla locations have [[Vidyo]], which has worked well)
** see also: [[remote participation]]
* time: due to the international nature of the community, good times are mornings on the US west coast and evenings in Europe (e.g. [[2017/Organizers]] was at 09:00 PDT (UTC-7) == 16:00 UTC == 18:00 CEST (UTC+2)


== Events Issues ==
=== Mediawiki awkward for events ===
One of our more awkward uses of MediaWiki is using it as an events calendar. 
=== Multiple places to update ===
* Adding an event like an IndieWebCamp or Homebrew Website Club involves updating several locations
** Home page list of events needs to be updated manually
** Events on [[events]] are updated manually
** [[Template:IndieWebCamp|IWC]] or [[Template:Homebrew_Website_Club|HWC]] templates are updated manually
** /next-iwc and /next-hwc redirects are updated manually

=== Creating new HWC pages is tedious ===
* Copy+pasting to create new HWC pages is tedious, and is typically only done [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-01-27/line/1453947587493 by Gregor and Tantek]
* Entering all the HTML required to format the page as an h-event is error prone

=== Wiki pages require manual RSVP ===
* Not easily able to add new features like accepting [[RSVPs]] to the wiki pages themselves

=== Event pages need better presentation ===
* The event pages look like wiki pages, with little visual hierarchy, and are not immediately recognizable as an event you can RSVP to to the general public

== Events Brainstorming ==
=== Events Problem Statements ===
* Lots of manual work to create / update events on indieweb.org (most often for [[Homebrew Website Club]], updating [[Events]], [[Main_Page]], and [[Sidebar]].
* Group event sites are hard, especially ones that take into account any particular community's needs

=== Events Non-goals ===
* Just changing the plumbing. Just changing the plumbing has pretty much no positive (likely more negative) effect on usability. E.g. (just "let's use jekyll for that")
* Just replace the editing UI / wiki mark-up/down syntax. E.g. the "simple web interface" benefit of jekyll is actually more complicated than the current wiki which is also a web interface. I.e. if all you're doing is replacing wiki markup with markdown, it's not a benefit. mediawiki: wiki syntax + mediawiki templates. jekyll: markdown + yaml blocks and includes. they're not actually that different.
* "learning one more system" = worse overall UX.
* Aspirational new system proposed by non-users of current system. The "I won't use the existing system because I hate wikis" argument is not a good argument, as absence of use of a current system provides no evidence that any new system would gain any use at all.

=== Events Replacement Requirements ===
Capturing here from IRC, some thoughts on possible requirements for any proposals to improve / replace entirety of how we create / update events on the IndieWeb.org site itself.

* '''Maintenance commitment up front.''' Volunteers to build a new system should also consider volunteering to maintain it, otherwise it's just trading one (known) maintenance tax (updating multiple places in the wiki, annoying, but simple/easy that anyone can do it), for another (unknown) maintenance tax (updating/fixing software, likely much harder, means it doesn't get done).
* '''Try and learn current system first.'''  Volunteers to design/build/replace events should at least *try* actively updating / creating events on indieweb.org so that they have some direct first-person understanding of the needs of the community. Without that first-hand knowledge, any such proposal is likely ignorant of the community's actual needs.
* '''Start with UI/UX sketches.''' Anything any of us want to build to replace the wiki events should start out with UI/UX sketches, no code at all.
* '''Support your own indie events first.''' Group events software is so much harder / more complex than indie [[event]] / [[RSVP]] posting support (likely a superset of), that that would make a good prerequisite for any proposals/proposers.

=== Separate Events Site ===
We used 2016.indieweb.org for the [[2016]] IndieWeb Summit. The [http://2016.indieweb.org IndieWeb Summit 2016] event page was an initial attempt at creating a more friendly format for our events. 

We have also set up 2016.indieweb.org/nyc2 for [[2016/NYC2|IndieWebCamp NYC2]].

Possibilities for expanding use of a separate site for events. 
* Continue with YYYY.indieweb.org
* New subdomain events.indieweb.org

==== Some events options to consider ====
* keep using YYYY.indieweb.org for annual summits, and YYYY.indieweb.org/CITYABBR for specific IndieWebCamps
* build our own minimal event interface 
* adopt an existing running project such as [[Calagator]] 
* wait for an in-progress project such as [[Dark Matter Eventer]]

==== Events Requirements ====
(not comprehensive) 
* Some level of unstructured content on event pages, so that we can allow our use of it to continue to evolve over time.
* Be able to quickly duplicate an event rather than set up recurring events (like Calagator's "clone" function)
* Events must support multiple locations and varying start times and timezones per location (our HWC events do this currently)

==== Events Ideas ====
* Quickly add links to posts (notes, photos, articles) about an event
* Highlight photos from events
** Upload photos directly to the wiki or event page
** By retrieving linked photos in indieweb photo posts / tweets / instagram posts
* RSVP via Webmention like http://2016.indieweb.org
* RSVP directly on the page (an "I'm Going" button after you're logged in)

==== Tickets and Registration ====
For the past couple years, we've had a separate ticketing website for letting people register/buy tickets to the events. We've found that having an explicit step of acquiring the ticket leads to better no-show rates. In 2016, the attendance rate of people who RSVPd from their website was 73%, vs that of people who bought a $5 ticket was 39%.

There isn't any value gained by having the registration system outside of the main event page, so integrating them would certainly be a good goal. Here are the features of the registration system that have been useful.

* Accepting payments for tickets.
* Issuing "tickets" in a way that feels stronger than just RSVPing for the event.
* Collecting the person's email address
* Providing a way to contact them before the event, such as sending reminders leading up to the event.

==== Other community events examples ====
* WordCamps, which have many properties in common with Indiewebcamps
** Uses wordcamp.org (likely derived from barcamp.org), a TLD different from the community: wordpress.org
*** Philosophy: a main landing page and using subdomains for the individual events, with year/location. 
*** Making wordcamp.org itself the page for upcoming events
*** Use subdomains on wordcamp.org for specific events
*** Issues: they had an issue with [https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/09/29/switching-back-to-the-original-wordcamp-urls/ URL structure] last year.
