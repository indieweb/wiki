The '''<dfn>[http://www.open-collaboration-services.org/ Open Collaboration Services]</dfn>''' ('''OCS''') API is a standardized [[REST]]ful API for the implementation of the Social Desktop.

From the web site:
<blockquote>
The concept behind the Social Desktop is to bring the power of online communities and group collaboration to desktop applications and the desktop shell itself.
</blockquote>

The API [https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services/ is specified] under the umbrella of the Free/OpenDesktop.org project.  It's purpose is to allow to create
desktop applications to get/send information to social network websites without the need to use a browser.

There seems to have existed [https://dot.kde.org/2009/05/01/social-desktop-starts-arrive one prototype implementation] of a desktop application using the OCS API for the KDE Desktop: a "plasmoid" showing friends, and nearby (geolocation) people, their status and links to them.  See also [https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Social-Desktop Social-Desktop on KDE Techbase].

Beeing a RESTful API, it could, in principle, be used outside the desktop environment for [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]].

Only Basic HTTP Authorisation is specified for use with the OCS API, which probably does not satisfy current
security requirements.
