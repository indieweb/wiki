=== problems ===
* I take photos with my phone and digital camera and I don't always have time to post / organize so they end up living on the device for months/years waiting for me to sort them out.
* I also have a backlog of ~10 years worth of photos that I want to organise and post to my site.

=== Ideal workflow ===
* take a bunch of photos/videos
* backup media from device to media endpoint
* use okami to post and organise that media
