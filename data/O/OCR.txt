'''<dfn>OCR</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>optical character recognition</dfn>''' is the way in which technology can recognize individual characters and words that are written out or present in a physical document. It might be used, for example, in recognizing [[handwriting]] or text in [[photo]]s and turning it into digital text for use in a personal website. 

In some cases, it may also be handy in providing [[alt|alt text]] to improve [[accessibility]] of photos which include significant text.

== How To ==
=== OCR using Google Docs ===
From [https://support.google.com/drive/answer/176692 Google's documentation], PDFs and images can be opened from [[Google Drive]] by selecting "Open with > Google Docs":
<blockquote>
The image file is converted, but the format might not transfer:

- Bold, italics, font size, font type, and line breaks are likely to be retained.

- Lists, tables, columns, footnotes, and endnotes are not likely to be detected.
</blockquote>
