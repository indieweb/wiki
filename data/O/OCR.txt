'''<dfn>OCR</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>optical character recognition</dfn>''' is the way in which technology can recognize individual characters and words that are written out or present in a physical document. It might be used, for example, in recognizing [[handwriting]] or text in [[photo]]s and turning it into digital text for use in a personal website. 

In some cases, it may also be handy in providing [[alt|alt text]] to improve [[accessibility]] of photos which include significant text.
