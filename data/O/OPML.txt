'''<dfn>OPML</dfn>''' stands for Outline Processor Markup Language, an [[XML]]-based format and defacto standard used for [[feed]] lists interchange.

== Silo Examples ==

Examples of [[silos]] that allow importing and exporting OPML files.

=== YouTube ===
[[YouTube]] allows people to export their subscriptions as an OPML file, which can then be used to subscribe any news reader to the channels they are subscribed to.

=== Feed Readers ===
Many silo-based [[feed readers]] support OPML import/export as well as OPML subscription. 

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [[dobrado]] allows import of subscriptions through OPML
* [[TinyTinyRSS]] supports OPML import and export via Settings -> Feeds -> OPML
* {{petermolnar}} has a `followings` menu point, which points to an OPML file, generated as an export from miniflux.

== Tools ==
* [http://opml-gen.ovh/ OPML Generator] input a list of RSS feeds and generate an OPML file
* [https://codebeautify.org/opmlviewer OPML viewer]

== Brainstorming ==
In the context of IndieWeb, the idea of OPML could be interesting as a representation of whom you [[follow]]. Since it is supported by a variety of sources, It could be a good candidate to solve the "how do you discover people" question.

The advantage of using OPML is its support, however, like [[RSS]], the standard has some limitations.

Some feed readers also support OPML subscriptions which allow users to subscribe to hosted copies of OPML files. Any changes to the OPML file are synced with the reader as new sources are added. (Compare this with importing a static OPML file that will never change.) Examples:
* [[Inoreader]]

Alternative: publish a visible [[blogroll]] on the home page or somewhere on your site and mark it up with [[XFN]].

=== Sharing via OPML ===
If you want to show to the world who you follow, you can share an opml file on your website.
