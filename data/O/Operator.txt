'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/operator Operator]</dfn>''' is a browser extension for [[Firefox]] that extracts semantic data like [[microformats]] from websites.

The extension is available [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/operator/ on AMO]. But it does not currently support the newer Firefox Quantum.
