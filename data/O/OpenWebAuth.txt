'''<dfn>OpenWebAuth</dfn>''' is the authentication protocol utilized by [https://framagit.org/zot/zap Zot6]; making use of Webfingers, HTTP Signatures and token generation for headless authentication. Projects like [[Hubzilla]] make use of it for authentication.

== Documentation ==
* https://framagit.org/zot/zap/blob/dev/spec/OpenWebAuth/Home.md
* https://project.hubzilla.org/help/developer/zot_protocol#Magic_Auth

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{addyourself}}
* ...

== Criticism ==
* Unclear on where the spec is actually defined
* Uses [[cryptography]] in the spec itself rather than keeping cryptography at the transport layer
* Relies on the site you're signing in to to accept the <code>owt</code> query parameter in every page, as opposed to confining the authentication code to a single URL that can redirect to the destination later
* Uses HTTP signatures but doesn't specify how the keys are discoverable, so it is unclear where to read to find that out
