== Criticism ==
* Unclear on where the spec is actually defined
* Uses [[cryptography]] in the spec itself rather than keeping cryptography at the transport layer
* Relies on the site you're signing in to to accept the <code>owt</code> query parameter in every page, as opposed to confining the authentication code to a single URL that can redirect to the destination later
* Uses HTTP signatures but doesn't specify how the keys are discoverable, so it is unclear where to read to find that out
