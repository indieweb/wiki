[[Category:silo]]
'''<dfn>[https://www.okuna.io Okuna]</dfn>''' is an ethical social network [[silo]] for a brighter tomorrow. Or so says it's website.

It's former name was Openbook when it was initial founded via Kickstarter [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1520156881/openbook-privacy-friendly-fun-and-honest-social-ne campaign] but [[Facebook]] took legal steps againt this name so it was eventually renamed to Okuna.

Okuna is currently donation driven via [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/openbook-it-s-time-for-a-better-social-network#/ Indiegogo] or [https://www.patreon.com/okuna Patreon] and various people contributing source or ideas on the Slack channel. A subscription plan (gold version) is also in the making but it's basic usage is supposed to be free. This is what the [https://www.okuna.io/en/manifesto Manifesto] says.

It's currently in a closed beta everyone can sign up for. Alpha users and bakers from the campaign can provide new users with beta keys that bypass the waiting list. It can be accessed via Okuna mobile version or the inofficial [https://gitlab.com/999eagle/okuna-desktop/-/releases desktop client] by [https://999eagle.moe/ Sophie Tauchert].

The software used is opensource and can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OkunaOrg/ Github] for inspection. There's also a roadmap for the next steps and while decentralisation is on the roadmap it's not yet implemented.

It reminds a lot of the early days of [[Google_Plus]] so it got a lot of attention from former [[Google_Plus]] users that feel very at home on Okuna due to similiar concepts of groups, circles and follow options.

=== How to POSSE to ===
You can use the Okuna API to POSSE your posts.

[[User:Beko.famkos.net|Beko Pharm]] is currently working on a POSSE provider that makes use of [https://github.com/OkunaOrg/okuna-js okuna-js], an API wrapper written in TypeScript. It's intended to scratch an own itch and is currently not public available since it's merely a proof on concept by now that is able to syndicate an article to Okuna making use of [[Webmention]] but not much else.

=== How to PESOS from ===
You can use the Okuna API to PESOS your posts.

=== How to backfeed from ===
You can use the Okuna API but it is probably a bad idea to backfeed any comments or reactions currently since Okuna is very strict about bots and it's currently a closed beta. Some people may be very offended if their felt privacy is violated by this even when posts are programmatically flagged as public. This may change when the website version of Okuna becomes available.
