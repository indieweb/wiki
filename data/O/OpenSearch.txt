'''<dfn>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180421215752/http://www.opensearch.org/Home OpenSearch]</dfn>''' is a specification for search engine discovery and syndication of search results. According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20180421215752/http://www.opensearch.org/Home#Introduction OpenSearch's Introduction], "OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results."

OpenSearch descriptions are specifically-formatted XML documents that site authors may link to from within an HTML page. OpenSearch-aware browsers may then allow users to take advantage of the site author's specified search engine.

== Example ==

<pre><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<OpenSearchDescription xmlns="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/">
  <ShortName>example.com</ShortName>
  <Description>Search example.com.</Description>
  <Url type="text/html" template="http://example.com/?q={searchTerms}"/>
</OpenSearchDescription></pre>

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20190301114038/https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md OpenSearch 1.1 Draft specification] fully details the required and optional elements that may be included in an OpenSearch description.

== Implementations ==

=== Browser UI Examples ===

==== Chromium 48 ====
In the following example, a user has previously visited [http://cweiske.de cweiske.de] and Chromium recognizes its OpenSearch description, indicated by the following markup in the page's <code><head></code>:

<pre><link rel="search" title="cweiske.de" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" href="/opensearch.xml"/></pre>

Typing "cweiske.de" in the browser's search bar shows the message, "Press tab to search cweiske.de":

After pressing tab, "Search cweiske.de" in the browser's search bar is presented with a blue background and a user can type a search term:

Pressing return, the user initiates a search and is presented a search results page:

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
* {{cweiske}} provides an OpenSearch description on http://cweiske.de/, utilizing site search on his own search engine at http://search.cweiske.de.
* {{jgarber}} provides an OpenSearch description on [https://sixtwothree.org sixtwothree.org] since 2016-02-15, delegating search to [https://duckduckgo.com DuckDuckGo].
