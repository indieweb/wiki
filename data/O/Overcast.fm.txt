== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{cleverdevil}} created a [https://gist.github.com/cleverdevil/a8215850420493c1ee06364161e281c0 Python script] that can log in to Overcast’s website, download the All Data OPML file and parse it to retrieve recently played episodes then, it uses an API for Known to create a listen post.
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} created a Node.js script based on {{cleverdevil}}’s that effectively does the same steps but creates a listen post using some experimental Micropub properties. Once the script is cleaned up, it will be linked here.
** Eddie runs his script once a day at 1am that looks over the OPML file for listens from the last 24 hours.
** Also Eddie has been thinking of using the OPML file to create [[follow]] posts on his site by looking for new Podcast subscriptions within the OPML file.
