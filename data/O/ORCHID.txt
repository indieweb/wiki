'''<dfn>[https://orcid.org/ ORCID]</dfn>''' or sometimes '''<dfn>ORCHID iD</dfn>''' is a nonprofit organization and web service helping researchers, scholars, and innovators to be uniquely identified and connected to their contributions and affiliations, across disciplines, borders, and time.

The ID itself is a non-proprietary 16-digit numeric identification number to uniquely identify people on the web and in print. This addresses the problem that a particular author's contributions to the scientific literature or publications in the humanities can be hard to recognize as most personal names are not unique, they can change (such as with marriage), have cultural differences in name order, contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviation.
