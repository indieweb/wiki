{{stub}}

'''<dfn>OpenSocial</dfn>''' was a "standards-based component model for cloud based social apps" formerly at <nowiki>http://opensocial.org/</nowiki> which now redirects (along with all URLs at that domain) to a W3C blog post: http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/12/opensocial-foundation-moves-standards-work-to-w3c-social-web-activity/

== Site Death ==
{{main|site-deaths#OpenSocial}}
=== 2014 ===
OpenSocial closed and gave everything to W3C.
* http://opensocial.org/ now redirects to W3C blog post - all previous opensocial.org site content was dropped on the floor. Supposedly someone at W3C has a database of it so it could be restored if there was time and incentive to do so.

Though https://opensocial.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OS/Home - wiki appears up but out of date?
