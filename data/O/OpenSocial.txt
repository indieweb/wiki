'''<dfn>OpenSocial</dfn>''' was a "standards-based component model for cloud based social apps" formerly at <nowiki>http://opensocial.org/</nowiki> which now redirects (along with all URLs at that domain) to a W3C blog post: http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/12/opensocial-foundation-moves-standards-work-to-w3c-social-web-activity/.

== Aftermath ==
Not much of what was "OpenSocial" has survived into any form in the present day.

The most recent interesting reference was a 2024-04-22 Twitter poll by Tom Coates:
* https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1782517696053297455 <blockquote><p>Tech friends, do you remember OpenSocial? If so how do you feel about it?</p> <br/>I remember. Good vibes! 22.4% <br/>I remember. Bad vibes :( 16.3% <br/>Nope. Sounds nice tho?! 28.6% <br/> Nope. Sounds awful. 32.7%</blockquote>

== Site Death ==
{{main|site-deaths#OpenSocial}}
=== 2014 ===
OpenSocial closed and gave everything to W3C.
* http://opensocial.org/ now redirects to W3C blog post - all previous opensocial.org site content was dropped on the floor. Supposedly someone at W3C has a database of it so it could be restored if there was time and incentive to do so.

Though https://opensocial.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OS/Home - wiki appears up but out of date?
