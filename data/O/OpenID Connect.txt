{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://openid.net/connect/ OpenID Connect]</dfn>''' is an authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0, that in practice is not implemented to provide open (portable) identifiers across systems, nor does it have anything to do with [[OpenID]] (1 or 2) except in name, but instead, identities are tied to a specific identity provider.
