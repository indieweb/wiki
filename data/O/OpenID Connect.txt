{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://openid.net/connect/ OpenID Connect]</dfn>''' is an authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0, that in practice is not implemented to provide open identifiers across systems, nor does it have anything to do with [[OpenID]] (1 or 2), but is a way to connect (tie) you to one specific identity provider to use that providerâ€™s services.
