'''<dfn>[https://octothorp.es/ Octothorpes]</dfn>''' is both an aggregator and a method of publishing [[hashtag]]s and [[backlink]]s to help connect web pages, and some community members have used them on their personal sites.

The code to run an Octothorpe Protocol Server is open source: https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es

One of the first broader uses of Octothorpes was [[Weird Web October]] 2024.

== How ==

See the [https://docs.octothorp.es/quickstart/ official quickstart guide] for more documentation.

# Register with an Octothorpe Protocol server (some require approval)
# Add markup to your site (i.e. '''rel="octo:octothorpes"''')
## <pre><link rel="octo:octothorpes" href="hummingbirds" ></pre>
## <pre><a rel="octo:octothorpes" href="https://OP-SERVER/~/hummingbirds">Use any link text you choose</a></pre>
# Request indexing of your page
## <pre><link rel="preload" as="fetch" href="https://octothorp.es/?uri=https://YOURDOMAIN.COM/PATH/TO/PAGE"></pre>

** "Octothorpes' link preload thing is clever but it's also a privacy violation (tracks visitors) and a waste of resources (every visitor pings the link but it only needs to happen once per post)." [http://martymcgui.re @[schmarty]] September 23, 2025

** "from a user/reader perspective, I'd rather link to a list/stream of hashtagged posts that works more broadly, regardless of what servers people are using. that seems like a more user-centric approach" [http://Tantek.com @[tantek]] September 23, 2025
* Criticism: "open internet" services do not require registration: https://chat.indieweb.org/2025-09-23#t1758600612141200
** "that's part of the point of standards, to avoid solutions that require "registration"" [http://Tantek.com @[tantek]] September 23, 2025
* [[tag aggregation]]
