'''<dfn>[https://octothorp.es/ Octothorpes]</dfn>''' is both an aggregator and a method of publishing [[hashtag]]s and [[backlink]]s to help connect web pages used by some community members on their personal sites.

One of the first broader uses of Octothorpes was [[Weird Web October]] 2024.

== How ==

=== Setting up your site for indexing ===

See the [https://docs.octothorp.es/quickstart/ official quickstart guide] for more documentation.

# Register with an Octothorpe Protocol server (some require approval)
# Add markup to your site (i.e. '''rel="octo:octothorpes"''')
## <pre><link rel="octo:octothorpes" href="hummingbirds" ></pre>
## <pre><a rel="octo:octothorpes" href="https://OP-SERVER/~/hummingbirds">Use any link text you choose</a></pre>
# Request indexing of your page
## <pre><link rel="preload" as="fetch" href="https://octothorp.es/?uri=https://YOURDOMAIN.COM/PATH/TO/PAGE"></pre>
# Your page appears on the relevant octothorpe page of the server

=== Running an OP Server ===

The code to run an Octothorpe Protocol Server is open source: https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* IndieWeb tags: https://octothorp.es/~/indieweb
* {{aciccarello}} has been experimenting with harmonizers on his site since 2025-10-09
* {{addyourself}}

== Brainstorming ==

=== Setting up a harmonizer to parse microformats ===

* There's a new feature called [https://docs.octothorp.es/harmonizers/ Harmonizers] which allows configuring how an OP server parses a page
* A project maintainer opened a [https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es/issues/94 Finalize WEBMENTION-CLIENT harmonizer definition] issue on GitHub
* The [https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es/blob/ccdae32d0f76a00c2b6013062324f611d777501f/src/routes/debug/testHarmonizer.js#L69-L74 project tests] reference a "Client-side Webmention to backlink harmonizer" which is defined with microformats2 selectors
* {{aciccarello}} experimented with microformats2 selectors but had to make some adjustments since it's not a true microformats parser and picked up elements other than the primary h-entry
* [https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es/issues/137#issuecomment-3416972707 it appears] this feature is not quite ready for production use

=== Using webmentions to trigger indexing ===

* Rather than using the link preload approach defined in the quickstart, a hidden URL could be used by some webmention infrastructure to trigger indexing
* The webmention sending will likely not send a webmention since the GET response will not have a webmention endpoint but the check alone should trigger indexing.

===Registration per server===

<blockquote>from a user/reader perspective, I'd rather link to a list/stream of hashtagged posts that works more broadly, regardless of what servers people are using. that seems like a more user-centric approach</blockquote>

<blockquote>that's part of the point of standards, to avoid solutions that require "registration"</blockquote>

<blockquote>if i had to criticize the design or idea of how octothorp.es did what they did, it's that it's inefficient for cases where you want your tags to be tracked on multiple destinations. every new destination is another link you have to add and another request to be fired off by the visitor's browser</blockquote>

=== Usage of link preload ===

The recommended approach to trigger indexing sends a request from each viewer's browser to the octothorpe server and does not actually preload any content for the page. See [[#Using_webmentions_to_trigger_indexing|Brainstorming]] for an alternate approach

<blockquote>Octothorpes' link preload thing is clever but it's also a privacy violation (tracks visitors) and a waste of resources (every visitor pings the link but it only needs to happen once per post).</blockquote>

<blockquote>i think it's pretty clear that you can do the same thing with webmention or websub but there really is one difference noting which is that most people don't know how to make their own POST requests easily or to automate that</blockquote>
