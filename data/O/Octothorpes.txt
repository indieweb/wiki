'''<dfn>[https://octothorp.es/ Octothorpes]</dfn>''' is both an aggregator and a method of publishing [[hashtag]]s and [[backlink]]s to help connect web pages, and some community members have used them on their personal sites.

The code to run an Octothorpe Protocol Server is open source: https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es

One of the first broader uses of Octothorpes was [[Weird Web October]] 2024.

== How ==

See the [https://docs.octothorp.es/quickstart/ official quickstart guide] for more documentation.

# Register with an Octothorpe Protocol server (some require approval)
# Add markup to your site (i.e. '''rel="octo:octothorpes"''')
## <pre><link rel="octo:octothorpes" href="hummingbirds" ></pre>
## <pre><a rel="octo:octothorpes" href="https://OP-SERVER/~/hummingbirds">Use any link text you choose</a></pre>
# Request indexing of your page
## <pre><link rel="preload" as="fetch" href="https://octothorp.es/?uri=https://YOURDOMAIN.COM/PATH/TO/PAGE"></pre>
# Your page appears on the relevant octothorpe page of the server

== IndieWeb Examples ==

===Registration per server===

<blockquote>from a user/reader perspective, I'd rather link to a list/stream of hashtagged posts that works more broadly, regardless of what servers people are using. that seems like a more user-centric approach</blockquote>

<blockquote>that's part of the point of standards, to avoid solutions that require "registration"</blockquote>

<blockquote>if i had to criticize the design or idea of how octothorp.es did what they did, it's that it's inefficient for cases where you want your tags to be tracked on multiple destinations. every new destination is another link you have to add and another request to be fired off by the visitor's browser</blockquote>

=== Usage of link preload ===

The recommended approach to trigger indexing sends a request from each viewer's browser to the octothorpe server and does not actually preload any content for the page.

<blockquote>Octothorpes' link preload thing is clever but it's also a privacy violation (tracks visitors) and a waste of resources (every visitor pings the link but it only needs to happen once per post).</blockquote>

<blockquote>i think it's pretty clear that you can do the same thing with webmention or websub but there really is one difference noting which is that most people don't know how to make their own POST requests easily or to automate that</blockquote>
