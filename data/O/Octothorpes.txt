'''<dfn>[https://octothorp.es/ Octothorpes]</dfn>''' is both an aggregator and a method of publishing [[hashtag]]s and [[backlink]]s to help connect web pages, and some community members have used them on their personal sites.

The code to run an Octothorpe Protocol Server is open source: https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es

One of the first broader uses of Octothorpes was [[Weird Web October]] 2024.

** "Octothorpes' link preload thing is clever but it's also a privacy violation (tracks visitors) and a waste of resources (every visitor pings the link but it only needs to happen once per post)." [http://martymcgui.re @[schmarty]] September 23, 2025

** "from a user/reader perspective, I'd rather link to a list/stream of hashtagged posts that works more broadly, regardless of what servers people are using. that seems like a more user-centric approach" [http://Tantek.com @[tantek]] September 23, 2025
