'''<dfn>[https://ownyourcheckin.wirres.net/ OwnYourCheckin]</dfn>''' is a service which streams your [[Foursquare]] (technically [[Swarm]]) [[checkin]]s to your own site in real-time. 

== Features ==
After signing in with [[IndieAuth]], it sends your  Foursquare (or Swarm) checkins to your [[micropub]] endpoint along with a photo and geo data. 

== Code ==
[https://github.com/diplix/OwnYourCheckin The code] is based on [[OwnYourGram]] by {{aaronpk}} with some changes by [http://wirres.net/ Felix Schwenzel]. 

How:
* A post from Felix on creation: http://wirres.net/article/articleview/9315/1/6/ 

Examples:
* http://wirres.net/article/articleview/9313/1/63/
* http://boffosocko.com/2016/05/17/55672674/ on [[WordPress]] with added map using published geo data. The syndicated link is automated through use of the [https://github.com/dshanske/syndication-links Syndication Links] WordPress plugin.

== Differentiation ==
Be aware that there is also another project by the same name [https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourcheckin OwnYourCheckin] by {{snarfed}} which watches for your Facebook checkins and copies them to your WordPress blog. A form of automated PESOS. Similar to and inspired by [[OwnYourGram]].
