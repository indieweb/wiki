{{stub}}

'''<dfn>OStatus</dfn>''' is a suite of protocols for distributed social networking: [[Atom]] [[ActivityStreams]], [[PubSubHubbub]], [[Salmon]], [[WebFinger]] per https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/365560040326840320 / Evan Prodromou, who later went on to develop [[pump.io]], which itself is being superseded by [[ActivityPub]].

== IndieWeb Equivalents ==
Here's a table of OStatus technologies and current IndieWeb equivalents that are being adopted:

{| border="1"
|+ 
! category
! OStatus
! IndieWeb

|- 
! syndication format
| [[Atom]] [[ActivityStreams]]
| [[h-feed]] and [[h-entry]]

|- 
! publishing notifications
| PubSubHubbub
| [[PubSubHubbub]] (0.4 arbitrary content)

|- 
! reply notifications
| [[Salmon]]
| [[webmention]]

|- 
! discovery / identity
| [[WebFinger]]
| [[rel-me]]

|}

Related (semi-generationally) but not officially part of OStatus: 
* [[OpenID]] and IndieWeb equivalent: [[IndieAuth]]

The indieweb equivalents are typically a subset and do not achieve the same levels of functionality as the OStatus technologies, however the indieweb equivalents are what's been developed so far to meet current use-cases.

== Site Death ==
{{main|site-deaths#OStatus}}
The main OStatus site ostatus.org died on 2012-10-09 when it was redirected to the [https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/ W3C OStatus Community Group], and apparently all posts and other information on ostatus.org was lost. Some content from the OStatus wiki at status.net/wiki/OStatus (defunct URL) was ported to the [https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/wiki/ W3C OStatus Community Group wiki].

* '''[https://web.archive.org/web/20121008070105/http://ostatus.org/ 2012-10-08 last archive]''' of ostatus.org home page
* <nowiki>https://web.archive.org/web/20121009153129/http://ostatus.org/</nowiki> 2012-10-09 first redirect to W3C Community Group

Eventually ostatus.org expired (when? 2018-09 or earlier) and was squatted (when? 2018-09 or earlier) - the current site is unrelated to the original.
