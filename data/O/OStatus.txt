'''<dfn>OStatus</dfn>''' is a suite of protocols for distributed social networking: [[Atom]] [[ActivityStreams]], [[PubSubHubbub]], [[Salmon]], [[WebFinger]] per https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/365560040326840320 / Evan Prodromou, who later went on to develop [[pump.io]], which itself is being superseded by [[ActivityPub]].

Here's a table of OStatus technologies and current IndieWeb equivalents that are being adopted:

Related (semi-generationally) but not officially part of OStatus: 
* [[OpenID]] and IndieWeb equivalent: [[IndieAuth]]

The indieweb equivalents are typically a subset and do not achieve the same levels of functionality as the OStatus technologies, however the indieweb equivalents are what's been developed so far to meet current use-cases.
