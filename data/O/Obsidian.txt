'''<dfn>[https://obsidian.md/ Obsidian]</dfn>''' is a free, multi-platform application for writing and maintaining plain text notes (for [[longevity]]) as markdown files that you can publish to your [[personal-domain]]. 

While not (yet) an open source project, the application encourages users to [[own_your_data|own their own data]] locally in a way that allows the use of alternate applications. 

== How To ==
=== How to publish to your site ===
While Obsidian is primarily a note-taking application, people have used tools to [[post]] and [[web_hosting|host]] their plain text notes online, which makes it IndieWeb-compatible. 

These options include: 
* [https://obsidian.md/publish?trk=public_post_comment-text Obsidian Publish] — is  Obsidian's official platform to create and update new posts from desktop or mobile (Paid) 
* [https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden Digital Obsidian Garden plugin] from Ole Eskild Steensen — lets you publish from the app, using [[Eleventy]] and [[GitHub]]. Allows further website customisation. (Free) 
* [https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/ Quartz] is also a [[static site generators|static site generator]] that converts Obsidian's markdown files into a digital garden. (Free)
* [https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs MkDocs] — offers an example of using [[GitHub Pages]]. (Free)
* This [https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-github-pages-for-digital-gardeners/2622 Obsidian+Github Pages discussion] shares links to other services and platforms as well as plugins, tools, and methods for creating [[SSG]]-based websites.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} has been using Obsidian as a daily note taking tool since 2020-08-25 with the explicit intention of publishing portions of it online as part of his digital [[commonplace book]]/[[digital garden]]/[[zettelkasten]].
* {{patoyson}} uses the Digital Garden plugin with Obsidian to publish to her experimental [[digital garden]] / [[zettelkasten]] site at https://garden.patsitive.co.nz
