'''<dfn>[https://obsidian.md/ Obsidian]</dfn>''' is a free, multi-platform application for writing and maintaining plain text notes (for [[longevity]]) as markdown files that provides a modest paid [[web_hosting|hosting]] service one can use with a [[personal-domain]]. 

While not (yet) an open source project, the application encourages users to [[own_your_data|own their own data]] locally in a way that allows the use of alternate applications. 

As of [https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-10-9/11679 2021-01-19 in version 0.10.9], the service provides a paid option for (selectively) [[web_hosting|hosting]] one's notes on a [[personal-domain]] allowing it to be used as an IndieWeb service.


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} has been using Obsidian as a daily note taking tool since 2020-08-25 with the explicit intention of publishing portions of it online as part of his digital [[commonplace book|commonplace book/digital garden/zettelkasten]].

* Others in the wild have used the raw text notes to publish their notes as a website online using [[static site generators]].
** “[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-github-pages-for-digital-gardeners/2622 Obsidian+Github Pages]” for digital gardeners? also includes links for other services and platforms as well as plugins, tools, and methods for creating [[SSG]]-based websites
