'''<dfn>[https://orgmode.org Org mode]</dfn>''' is for keeping notes, maintaining [[todo]] lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system. Primarily used and designed for use in the [[emacs]] editor, Org mode extensions are available for other [[editor]]s and operating systems.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [https://doubleloop.net/ Neil Mather] has a [[commonplace book|commonplace]] at https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/ that is just basic in [[emacs]] using [[orgmode]] and [https://org-roam.readthedocs.io/en/develop/ org-roam] and publishing it as static HTML from org-mode; My holy grail would be something like [[TiddlyWiki]] but in emacs.
* [https://indieweb.org/User:Notes.whatthefuck.computer Ryan Rix] built an IndieWeb-enabled static-site generator on top of org-mode: [https://indieweb.org/User:Notes.whatthefuck.computer#Arcology Arcology].
