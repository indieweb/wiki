    '''<dfn>[http://opensourcebridge.org/ Open Source Bridge]</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>OSBridge</dfn>) is an annual open source conference in Portland Oregon where many indieweb talks have been given over the years, and the event which served as an anchor for the immediately adjacent very first [[IndieWebCamp]] in [[2011]].

== Why ==
Open Source Bridge provides an excellent opportunity to learn about the latest in grassroots open source development, design, and community.

By issuing an annual open request for talk proposals, which anyone can openly vote on, there is both a lot of opportunity to discuss interesting open source topics that you are passionate about (by proposing a talk and/or voting on talks you'd like to see and participate in).

Aside from organized talks, there is also a one day [[BarCamp]] on the Friday of OSBridge week, which provides an opportunity to show-up and propose a break-out session to discuss whatever about open source you'd like to discuss.

Because of its grassroots nature, OSBridge attracts a quite a diverse spectrum of attendees, from hobbyists, to tinkerers, to independent developers, and even folks from large companies, all looking to meet and interact with the diverse crowd.
