'''<dfn>[https://www.respectnetwork.com/ Respect Network]</dfn>''' appears to be a closed vaporware [[monoculture]] for-pay cloud service launched with a high-gloss marketingy website at www.respectnetwork.com.

== Criticism ==
=== Uses complex standards ===
Per: https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/464502782276292608
<blockquote>Respect uses XDI as a transmission protocol. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI  The #indieweb approach, as a comparison: http://indiewebify.me/  #iiw</blockquote>

* I looked at this standard for 10 minutes and was bewildered. It was hard to find an implementation or how to actually use it, when I finally did, the markup was hideous to look at [[User:BrennanNovak.com]]

=== Closed ===
per https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/464503235739279360:
<blockquote>
<strong>The Respect Network is closed</strong> and has tiered membership fees. Would prefer web-style free & open protocols. #iiw #indieweb
</blockquote>
<strong>Strong emphasis</strong> added.

=== Membership Fees ===
per https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/464503235739279360:
<blockquote>
<strong>The Respect Network</strong> is closed and <strong>has tiered membership fees</strong>. Would prefer web-style free & open protocols. #iiw #indieweb
</blockquote>
<strong>Strong emphasis</strong> added. And per https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/464506844627484674:
<blockquote>Personal clouds, business clouds, nfp clouds. All good. Why do we need to pay to join the network? I don't on the web. #iiw #indieweb</blockquote>
