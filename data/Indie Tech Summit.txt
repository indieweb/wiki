The '''<dfn>Indie Tech Summit</dfn>''' was an [[events|event]] held 2014-07-04 in Brighton, UK[https://www.indietech.org/summit/] that covered many indieweb related topics (among others). It was organized by [[2013/UK|IndieWebCamp UK 2013]] co-organizer [[User:aralbalkan.com|Aral Balkan]] and a few IndieWebCamp participants also spoke at it, e.g. [[User:tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] and fellow [[2013/UK|IndieWebCamp UK 2013]] co-organizer [[User:adactio.com|Jeremy Keith]].

== Confusion ==
On at least one instance, "Indie Tech Summit" has been confused as an "Indie Web Summit":
<blockquote>
defmoves Bret: I saw Jeremy Keith's talk at the '''indie web summit'''. Made a note, lost it, found it again.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-24/line/1408919550582]
</blockquote>
'''Emphasis''' added.
