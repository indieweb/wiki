{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Celery</dfn>''' is a [[Python]]-based tool for executing asynchronous background tasks, distributing tasks amongst many worker processes, and running scheduled or period tasks (via [http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html Celerybeat]). It can be backed by [[Redis]] or [[RabbitMQ]] (officially; other transports are experimental) for messaging passing and persistence.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* [[Woodwind]] uses Celery backed by Redis for periodic feed polling, and for background processing like updating a feed in response to a [[PuSH]] ping.
