{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>autolink</dfn>''' is a hyperlink that was automatically added to some text to link that text to an obvious or useful destination, like hyperlinking a URL in plaintext to the URL itself, linking [[hashtags]] to search results, and @-names to their profile pages.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} posts plain text [[notes]] on tantek.com which are autolinked (URLs, @-names) with the CASSIS <code>auto_link</code> function [http://tantek.com/2010/047/t1/links-cassis-auto_link-idempotent-apache-licensed since 2010-02-16].

=== ... many more ... ===
Feel free to add your site if you also support posting of [[notes]] with autolinking, and note since when.

== Open Source ==
See [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function for a fairly good (and [[selfdogfood]]ed) open source autolink implementation for [[PHP]]&amp;[[JS]].

== Silo Examples ==
Most [[silos]] autolink URLs, some autolink hashtags &amp; @-names as well ([[Twitter]], [[Instagram]]).
