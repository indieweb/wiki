The '''<dfn>IndieWeb Gift Calendar</dfn>''' ([[#Renaming|previously IndieWeb Challenge]]) is a group effort to ship one or more IndieWeb-related thing(s) each day of December that others can use to improve their IndieWeb experience. Anyone can participate, and if you’re looking for ideas, see the '''[[#Inspiration|Inspiration section below]]'''. 

This can be anything from major [[wikify|wiki documentation contributions / improvements]] to shipping updates on any of the IndieWeb applications (like [[social reader]]s), [[services]], [[CMS]]s, [[plugin]]s, [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], or any other projects in use by multiple folks. 

See [[2018-12-indieweb-challenge|last year’s gift calendar]] (where we shipped something every day!) for specific examples.

__TOC__
Please keep in mind the '''[[#Considerations|Considerations]]''' and if you’re not sure, you may want to first make a commitment for yourself (and follow through) to ship something you’ll use on your own site, as it will likely help reveal ways to improve things for the community as a whole that others can also use:

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below!

== Considerations ==
Please keep in mind the following considerations when adding something to a day:
* It must be shipping / usable, not just a blog post announcing / saying you plan to do it.
* Is it clear what your thing does?
* Is it clear how someone is supposed to use it or otherwise benefit from it?
* What use-case does it solve for others (besides yourself)? Ask yourself, how would/could someone else in the community use the thing I'm posting? 
* If it's a markup / styling example, is it clear what its purpose is, and how someone could/should copy the markup/styling and customize it for their own site?
* If it's a programming example, is it clear how an indieweb site could use the code, using what language(s)? Does it require any frameworks?
* If it's a code example or project, is it clearly open sourced, with a clear link to its GitHub or other code repo that has at least a README explaining how it can be used for either direct user benefit or to enhance existing indieweb sites?


== History ==
=== Renaming ===
Previously called the "IndieWeb Challenge", it was renamed 2019-12-07 due to confusion about who was it for (yourself, others). Renaming discussion follows:
----

'''Note: planning to rename 2019-12-04 morning PST to best consensus choice, absent objections.''' - {{t}}
* Current top candidate: IndieWeb Challenge -> '''IndieWeb Gift Calendar'''

There have been multiple new community members that have (mis)interpreted "IndieWeb Challenge" as something they’re supposed to make/post/ship *on their own site* for the month of December, instead of the intent of making something *for others* to be able to use. The notion/framing of a "challenge" does imply personal accomplishment so this is an understandable mistake.

Thus it is worth considering renaming "The IndieWeb Challenge" to something which more directly communicates the intended meaning of "ship something IndieWeb-related that benefits the community, people in addition to yourself, every day of December".

Candidates (feel free to add more)
* '''IndieWeb Challenge'''
** -1 {{t}} current name has shown to be problematic, also may want to re-use for something like Brad Frost's ”[https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/making-things-in-december/ Making Things in December]”
** -1 {{fluffy}} Agree that the name makes it feel like a personal challenge to improve one's site/self rather than helping the community
** -1 {{aaronpk}} agree that it's been confusing for people
* '''IndieWeb Gifting'''
** +0 {{t}} could live with this
** -0 {{aaronpk}} not a big fan of the connotations associated with "gifting"
** -1/0/+1 {{addyourself}}
* '''IndieWeb Giving'''
** -1 {{t}} this sounds too much like an actual $ funding campaign
** -1 {{aaronpk}} too much like fundraising
** -1/0/+1 {{addyourself}}
* '''IndieWeb Gift Calendar'''
** +1 {{t}} my preferred choice currently, directly communicates the gift (to the community) intent / similarity to an Advent Calendar
** +1 {{jeremycherfas}} gave a 👍🏼 reaction in Slack to [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2019-12-03/1575334408629900 this statement]
** +1 {{aaronpk}} "[https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2019-12-03/1575334425210500 That does make it more clear what it is]" - probably the least bad option
** +1 {{fluffy}} More of a 0.5 (rounded up) in that I think it's less-bad than the current name but "calendar" implies advance planning to me
** -1/0/+1 {{addyourself}}
