== Site Death ==
On 2014-05-05 it was announced the site would be shut down. [http://mlkshk.typepad.com/mlkshk/2014/04/goodbye.html]

<blockquote>MLKSHK isn’t our primary source of income and it’s certainly not our primary focus. Despite earning very little from the site we still have to answer tech support, deal with spam, fix minor issues, fix major issues, keep the servers updated, sort out billing issues, and worry about the months we get linked on Reddit. Sometimes the server and bandwidth bill are more than we took in for the month—this is scary.</blockquote>

However, on 2014-06-30 they reversed that decision. [http://mlkshk.typepad.com/mlkshk/2014/06/mlkshk-is-open.html]

<blockquote>We want to tell you that MLKSHK will not be closing! And not only are we not closing but we are going to be doing some good stuff in the coming months. We appreciated all the nice things you tweeted and mailed to us, and we realized just how special this site was to so many of you. To turn it off would be a big loss. It’s a pretty special place.</blockquote>
