== Issues ==
=== Rejected microformats2 markup in default theme ===
[[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] sent [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/pull/29 a pull request] to casper (the default Ghost theme) which added [[h-entry]] and [[h-card]] [[microformats2]] markup, but it was rejected. John O’Nolan followed up with:

<blockquote>
“microformats2 is a very interesting subject and one which we are pay close attention to. At this time though, we're not ready to recommend it as part of the default Ghost theme. We absolutely encourage you to use it in all your personal themes, however - and of course you are welcome to distribute a 'microformats2-enabled' fork of Casper!” [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/pull/29#issuecomment-26315696]
</blockquote>

Note: A follow-up post on the Ghost blog: http://blog.ghost.org/structured-data/ said they "added meta tag output for Schema.org, Twitter Cards, and Open Graph" - all oligopoly (schema), or [[silo]]-specific invisible meta markup.

Thus perhaps it is worth trying again with another pull request to add microformats2 support since it is more open and more standard than any of those.

== Criticism ==
* none currently

== History ==
=== Concept ===
Ghost was originally offered as a concept in reaction to [[WordPress]] and was self-described as:
* An "idealistic and fictional concept for a WordPress-lite fork" [http://john.onolan.org/ghost/]
* A "lite version of WordPress" [http://john.onolan.org/ghost-from-fiction-to-function/]

=== Early image introduction ===
The introduction to the concept of Ghost was purely an image instead of using text. Text images were addressed as first question in his [http://john.onolan.org/ghost-from-fiction-to-function/ FAQ].

=== Kickstarter campaign ===
Ghost managed to raise £196,362 of through [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/widget/video.html funding through Kickstarter], with more sponsored after it had ended. This spurred the start of development

=== Transition from WordPress ===
It was decided early on that the [[WordPress]] PHP code was too convoluted and so they started from scratch.

Node.js was chosen for the platform, due to many benefits such the Node Package Manager and associated ecosystem. The templating code was kept very similar to Wordpress, using the mustache templating engine instead of PHP.

=== Launch ===
Ghost [http://blog.ghost.org/public-launch/ officially launched on 2013-09-19].

=== Dogfooding at launch ===
There was originally criticism that John O'Nolan (the founder of Ghost) has a blog http://john.onolan.org/ that runs on Wordpress, instead of [[selfdogfooding]] or even [[dogfooding]]. This was because Ghost was originally just an idea that was proposed, it took a while to make it. 

As of 2013-09-19 he had a subdomain running Ghost at http://ghost.onolan.org/ - which is [[dogfooding]] but not yet [[selfdogfooding]]. He was not yet running it on his personal (identity) domain at http://john.onolan.org/ (which was running [[WordPress]] at the time) - thus not yet satisfying the "self" in selfdogfooding, that is, dogfooding your code to represent your primary <em>self</em> online.

As of 2014-04-12, http://john.onolan.org/ has moved to Ghost and fully [[selfdogfooding]]
