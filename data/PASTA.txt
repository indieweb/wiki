{{stub}}

'''<dfn>PASTA</dfn>''' is an acronym/abbreviation for Publish Anywhere, Save To ([[private]]) [[archival copy|Archive]], the practice of automatically saving a copy of whatever you post on (social media) [[silo]]s to someplace else under your own control, like a private directory on your own server, or a local folder on your laptop that is less vulnerable to [[site-death]].

PASTA can be one way of building up a local export that eventually you can use to [[backfill]] to your own site.

PASTA is not syndication, so it is not just [[PESOS]] to a private archive. The archived copies of the post are not published, but only accessible for the owner of the archive. Thus, in case of a [[site-death]], the public copy is still lost for other people.

PASTA also does not apply when storing information directly in an archive, like [[GPS logging]] or making private [[bookmarks]], because the information was not public in the first place and has never been published.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} uses [[Camlistore]] as a personal archive for:
* posts from [[Twitter]]
* checkins from [[Swarm]] (and old checkins from [[Foursquare]])
* bookmarks from [[Pinboard]]
* photos from [[Flickr]]

Camlistore provides importers that use each services' API to gather and store the post data for his main account on that service.

He also uses [[OwnYourSwarm]] to [[PESOS]] Swarm checkins, and often POSSEs his Twitter posts, but this archive ensures that he has a personal backup copy of these posts.
