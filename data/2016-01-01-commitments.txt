2015-12-13 {{gwg}} https://david.shanske.com/2015/12/13/post-kinds-improvements/ - Goal of completing improvements to Post Kinds Plugins for WordPress. Includes addition of time field support, improvements to display, and help. Unsure if all will be fully complete by 2016, but intend to ship what is ready by that point, deploying to site and other individuals that use the plugin.

Deployed update 2015-12-30, some display improvements have been punted into 2016, as this is a continual process. Awaiting feedback from other users.

== FAQ ==
=== Why 2016-01-01 ===
Q: Why specifically 2016-01-01?[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-18#t1418923764501]

A: Because we did [[2015-01-01-commitments]] last year and got a lot done with them!

Q2: Why specifically 2015-01-01 previously then?

A2: {{t}} I picked 2015-01-01 as a proposed ship commitment date since I shipped "[[notes]]" on my own site on 2010-01-01.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-18#t1418924024251]  2015-01-01 was the first "ship commitment by the new year" that we did as a community.
