'''<dfn>web intents</dfn>''' were a [[Google]] attempt to bring the features/interaction of Android Intents from the Android Application SDK to the web. They were prototyped in Chrome and then removed in early 2013.

=== 2011 ===
Web intents were discussed at three IndieWebCamp [[2011]] sessions:
* [[2011/Standardizing Web Intents|Standardizing Web Intents]] 
* [[2011/Demos#web_intents_user_experience|Web Intents User Experience]]
* [[2011/Demos#web_intents_format_brainstorm_and_Firefox_plugin|Web Intents Format Brainstorm and Firefox plugin]]

== Criticisms ==
Those attending and participating in related IndieWebCamp sessions realized after having to explain and attempt to speak about them, that "web intents" as a term/phrase was too confusing to effectively do user centered research and design. After some brainstorming about what problems were actually being solved, [[web actions]] was suggested as a user-centered reframing for common use cases.

Early feedback (2011-2012) was given to folks at Google who worked on web intents that they needed to prioritize UI/UX first, and only after they'd figured that out, attempt any kind of standardizing of protocols/formats. This feedback was largely ignored.

Google's experimental Chrome implementation of web intents had several UI problems which caused them to remove their implementation.
