'''<dfn><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a></dfn>''' is a large collection of boilerplate HTML and CSS styles and components originally developed by Twitter. It is a very fast way to create a basically good-looking and mobile-friendly site, though it can be a challenge when doing lots of detailed or custom styling.
