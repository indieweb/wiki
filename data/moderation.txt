<dfn>Moderation</dfn> is the process of holding [[comments]] for review by a human, and sometimes a source of frustration when a comment is written on another site that the commenter has no control over.

== Moderation Status ==

Just deleting it on one or other of them is likely not enough, as it could be brought back by sending the webmention again.
