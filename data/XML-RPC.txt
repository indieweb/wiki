{{stub}}

'''<dfn>XML-RPC</dfn>''' is an outdated and verbose use of XML over HTTP to make API calls, sometimes errantly used as a synonym of [[MetaWeblog]] API (the most well known example thereof), that enables and implicitly encourages using your actual username and password (instead of [[OAuth]]) with client software, thus overprivileging that software, as well as possibly transmitting your password in the clear over HTTP.

== How to disable ==
=== WordPress XML-RPC ===
If you have any experience with these methods, please add it here!

* There is a plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-xml-rpc/ Disable XML-RPC]
* Or follow these instructions: http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/219666

== Criticism ==
=== Verbose ===
“XML-RPC does not add any value over XML … 4 times the number of bytes compared to plain XML to encode the same objects, which is itself verbose compared to JSON.” More:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC#Criticism

=== Encourages Password Antipattern ===
XML-RPC depends on the user’s username and password being entered into every third party XML-RPC client software to send to the XML-PRC server, an example of the [http://microformats.org/wiki/social-network-anti-patterns#Enter_your_other_site_login_and_password password antipattern].

Even for just this reason, XML-RPC is to be avoided by both client and server software, and [[OAuth]] based protocols (e.g. [[Micropub]]) should be used instead.

=== Encourages passwords over HTTP ===
Even if both client and server are from the same manufacturer / project, because XML-PRC depends on username and password being transmitted, possibly in the clear (i.e. over HTTP not [[HTTPS]]), it makes the user vulnerable to network traffic sniffing, and thus use of XML-RPC apps creates a likely [[security]] risk for users.
