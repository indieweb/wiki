'''<dfn>development tax</dfn>''' is all the time you spend <em>development</em> the software that runs your personal site, rather than actually <em>using</em> it (like to [[create]] [[posts]]).

Examples of development tax:
* Adding new features to your site
* Changing your entire backend

The problem with a development tax is that many individuals truly enjoy development as a hobby as much as creating content.
