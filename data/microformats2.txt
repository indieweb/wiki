'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2 microformats2]</dfn>''' is the latest stable and interoperable version of [[microformats]].

== Background ==
* 2010-05-02 {{t}} proposed considering a major update to microformats, called microformats2, at Foo East session: http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2010-05-02-microformats-2-0. Outstanding major issues from "classic" microformats were discussed, along with one-by-one minimal solutions to address them, as well as any and all ways of making microformats even simpler to publish and parse. Tantek collected those proposed solutions into what became microformats2.

Since then, {{t}}, has edited and maintained the following specifications as part of microformats2:
* http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2 (more background there)
* http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing
