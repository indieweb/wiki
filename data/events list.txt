{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>events listing</dfn>''' is a page or portion of a page (like on a [[homepage]]) of an indieweb site that shows a list of events, including some subset of the site's own [[event]], [[invitation]], and [[RSVP]] posts, displayed as a list or grid of some sort.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Overall, all of these examples show events lists as a stream or list, none as a "calendar".
=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} has an events stream, shown in reverse chronological order of when the events were created, [http://werd.io/event/51c94deebed7de5c2386a1b4/unofficial-portland-post-indiewebcamp-meetup since 2013-06-25] (presumably, based on [[Known]]/idno's architecture of automatically have lists of each explicit post type).
* http://werd.io/content/events

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has an events stream, showing events in reverse chronological order, most recent first:
* http://aaronparecki.com/events
=== Jeena ===
{{jeena}} has an automatic listing of his upcoming events, ordered by calendar date (soonest first) and then past events are most recent first, since 2015-??-??
* https://jeena.net/events
=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} has an automatic listing of upcoming events (including indie events hosted on his own site and "yes" RSVPs) on his home page, ordered by calendar date (soonest first), since 2016-12-06.

=== manually ===
==== IndieWebCamp ====
This community keeps a manually edited summary of upcoming events on:
* [[Events]]

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has manually posted a brief summary of three upcoming events that he is going to, perhaps speaking at, or organizing, on the bottom of his home page since 2012(rough guestimate ? need to lookup exact year/date)
