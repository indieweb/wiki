{{davidpeach}} has built a small hack on his personal site to scrape a url that is passed over from a bookmarklet. The scraping uses [[PhantomJS]] to allow for pulling in of [[JavaScript]]-created content.

Article on how this is implemented : [http://davidpea.ch/articles/671 Semi-automated PESOS from google play music]

* At the moment the following things are pulled through: 
** Artist
** Album
** Basic album info
** Album art.
* See an example of the data being used on [http://davidpea.ch David's web site].
