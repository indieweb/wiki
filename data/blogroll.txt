== History ==
Doc Searls has been credited with coining the term blogroll [http://doc.weblogs.com/2000/12/17 in a blog post on 2000-12-17].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members (have participated in at least one IndieWebCamp) with blogrolls:
* Tom Morris has a [http://tommorris.org/pages/blogroll blogroll separate from his home page]
** [http://tommorris.org/pages/blogroll-about about Tom's blogroll page]
* Barnaby Walters has a blog roll marked up with h-card and [[xfn]]
** http://waterpigs.co.uk/contacts

== Examples in the wild ==
More example
* [[User:Melvincarvalho.com]] has a blogroll on his site with a list of co-workers / colleagues "people I know and had the pleasure to work with".

== Brainstorming ==

* I have two issues with traditional-style blogrolls: they required maintenance, and have no utility other than existing on your homepage for people to maybe click. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 16:24, 1 July 2013 (PDT)

Remove maintenance by making blogrolls more tangible — for example derive them from your address book, a feed reader or people you mention. In the past blogrolls often meant “people who’s blogs I read”, and were organised by frequency. All of that information exists/could be derived from feed readers. Similarly, “people I mention” is a tangible, interesting metric which reflects real-world behaviour.

Blogrolls could also be made more actionable, for example if feed readers were to accept a URL with XFN and h-card on, and subscribe to all of the people, or a filtered subset (e.g. all XFN friends, or h-cards tagged with a particular p-category).
