A '''<dfn>webcam</dfn>''' is a digital camera that can typically stream video and audio to the web (useful for [[remote participation]] in [[IndieWebCamps]] and virtual [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups) either as a peripheral connected (via [[USB]], [[Bluetooth]]) to a computer, or as a standalone device directly connected to the internet by wifi (AKA [[IoT]] webcam), though the latter tend to be vulnerable to attack.
