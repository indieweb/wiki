    '''<dfn>[https://mercury.postlight.com/ Mercury]</dfn>''' is a suite of reading related tools featuring an API that takes any web article and returns only the relevant content — headline, author, body text, relevant images and more — free from any clutter. 

=== Web Parser ===
Make semantic sense out of any web article. Mercury Parser is a single API endpoint that takes a URL and gives you back the content reliably and easily. It took over the functionality of the [[Readability]] API when Readability shut down in late 2016.

=== AMP Converter ===
With just one line of code, Mercury AMP prepares your publication for Google AMP. Get lightning-fast load times and boosted search results on mobile.

=== Mercury Reader ===
Turn any article into a clean and readable page with one click using our new Chrome browser extension.
