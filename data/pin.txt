'''<dfn>pin</dfn>''' or <dfn>pinning</dfn> is a feature that allows the author to choose a [[post]] to put at the top of their profile (or [[homepage]]) which is then called a <dfn>pinned</dfn> or <dfn>sticky</dfn> post.

== Why ==
Sometimes you want to pin a post that's temporally (or temporarily) relevant - e.g. before an [[event]] (human) or [[site-deaths|site shutdown]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Software Support ==
* [[WordPress]] has supported sticky posts since 2.7

== Silo Support ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has supported pinned posts on [[event]] posts, [[pages]] for quite some time.
=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]]'s mid-2014 UI update added support for a pinned post on a user profile.

== Brainstorming ==
More thinking on pinned / sticky posts:
* You may not want it to be the first post in your profile - because that may give the illusion that there's nothing newer.
* Possibly 1-2 normal in-stream posts display, then followed by the pinned post, almost like it is a promoted post for itself.
* I want to be able to pin posts in different feeds, ie. on certain tag pages. So the post could still appear chronologically in places where it's not pinned. - {{rhiaro}}
* I don't want a reader to treat a pinned post as always the most recent in a feed. Do readers sort things themselves by published date, or display things in the order they pull them from a feed? - {{rhiaro}}
