** "Sometimes it feels like @vimeo is trying to push users away. For the first time in nearly 8 years I've decided not to pay for their premium services, and now most of my videos (including my own wedding video) is hidden behind a paywall."

** "For those not following: if you upload videos to vimeo when you're on a pro or plus account and then step down to a free account you can't access your older videos anymore. It's like a hostage situation and you're forced to pay up. It's crap. @vimeo sucks" [http://www.matjoez.com/freebook @Matjoez] October 28, 2019
