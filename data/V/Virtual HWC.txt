'''<dfn>Virtual HWC</dfn>''' is an online [[Homebrew Website Club]] for IndieWebbers who either can’t make a regular meeting or don’t yet have critical mass to host one in their area.

The first virtual meet-up was organised by {{chrisaldrich}} and {{GWG}} on [[events/2016-12-14-homebrew-website-club|December 14, 2016]] on Pacific Time. On [[events/2017-05-31-homebrew-website-club|May 31, 2017]], another virtual meet-up was organised by {{jeena}}, {{martijnvdven}}, and {{petermolnar}} for people on Central European Time.

The virtual meet-up on Central European Time is a regular event every two weeks, currently hosted on {{sknebel}}’s [[Mumble#voice.sknebel.net|Mumble server]].

== software ==

Below are some services/software that have been used (or are considered) for virtual meet-ups. Please contribute if you have positive or negative experiences with any of these!

=== appear.in ===

[[appear.in]] has been used for vHWC Europe.

Looks extremely similar to Talky in both features and technology.

{{pros-cons
| pro1 = Works directly from modern browsers without set-up (through [[WebRTC]]).
| pro2 = Ability to share your screen for demos.
| con1 = [[P2P]] technology means relatively high data usage.
| con2 = issues with only partial connections especially with many participants.
| con3 = requires (free) sign up for room creator
}}

=== Google Hangouts ===

[[Hangouts]] was used for the virtual meet-ups on Pacific Time.

{{pros-cons
| pro1 = Hangouts On Air allows streaming the meet-up to [[YouTube]], creating an archive.
| con1 = Requires the use of Google Accounts. (this requirement is supposed to have been dropped, need to test this to make sure)
}}

=== Talky ===

[[Talky]] was used for the virtual meet-ups on Central European Time.

{{pros-cons
| pro1 = Works directly from modern browsers without set-up (through [[WebRTC]]).
| pro2 = Ability to share your screen for demos.
| con1 = [[P2P]] technology means relatively high data usage (according to {{Zegnat}} it is worse than other WebRTC things)
}}

=== Mumble ===

[[Mumble]] is being used for virtual meet-ups.

{{pros-cons
| pro1 = Native clients available for most systems.
| pro2 = Very low data usage.
| pro3 = Third-party browser client available.
| con1 = Audio only. No webcam or stream sharing.
| con2 = Requires a server hosted or rented by the organiser.
}}

==== Notes ====

* Jonas Herzig’s open-source [https://github.com/Johni0702/mumble-web mumble-web] can be used in a browser, taking away the need for native clients. It requires a custom proxy in front of the mumble server set-up and will thus not work with all servers out-of-the-box.
* [https://guildbit.com/ GuildBit] offers free temporary servers on demand, with a choice of region, and might be a good option for impromptu meet-ups.

=== Discord ===

[[Discord]] is being looked into as a viable platform for future virtual meet-ups.

{{pros-cons
| pro1 = Both native and web clients available.
| pro2 = Useable without registering an account beforehand.
| con1 = Audio only. No webcam or screen sharing.
| con2 = Creates a [[Slack]] like environment with multiple text and audio rooms that need navigating.
}}

==== Notes ====
* Video and screen sharing is in beta as of 2017-8-10: https://medium.com/@discordnelly/were-testing-video-chat-and-screen-share-with-5-of-players-today-c8ddb108ca31
