'''<dfn>[https://virtkick.io VirtKick]</dfn>''' is a software [[project]] that aims to be an open source, self-hosted replacement of DigitalOcean. It simplifies creating, managing, hosting and providing virtual servers and containers. VirtKick will be shipped in [[arkOS]].

== Crowdfunding ==
At the end of October, 2014 VirtKick developers launched a crowdfunding campaign [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/virtkick-take-cloud-back on Indiegogo] to raise $57,000 for further development.

== Commercial use ==
VirtKick will ship with optional e-commerce features, so VPS providers can use them to sell machines. This way VirtKick makes it possible for non-tech people to use it. What's most important, users will be able to migrate their machines between VPS providers that use VirtKick.

== Technologies ==

* KVM and OpenVZ to run virtual machines
* libvirt is an abstraction layer to KVM
* [[Docker]] to make use of images in [https://registry.hub.docker.com/ Registry Hub]
* Ansible to auto-configure hypervisors
