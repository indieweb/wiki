'''<dfn>Venmo</dfn>''' is a [[payment]] application and social network that recently (when?) stopped allowing new developers to use their [[API]]. 

== Documentation ==
* https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/210413477-Sending-Requesting-Money <blockquote>If youâ€™re on the web, click ''here'' to send a payment.</blockquote> ''emphasis'' added to indicate a hyperlink:
** '''<code><nowiki>https://venmo.com/?txn=pay&note=Enter%20your%20note%20here</nowiki></code>'''
** note: through experimentation, an '''<code>&amount=nn.nn</code>''' parameter also works
** from previous documentation: '''<code>venmo.com/Username</code>''' will preselect the user to pay as well.
** all of these can be combined in a single link to select a '''note''', '''amount''', and '''username''' to pay.
** See: [[payment#Payment_page_with_amount]] for more.

Previously:
* <nowiki>https://developer.venmo.com/docs/payment-links</nowiki> (previously described <code>venmo.com/Username</code> links)
** ^^^ unable to get this to work in archive.org - if you can link to an archive.org static copy (without JS) that works, please add it here!
