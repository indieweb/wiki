== Issues ==
* Installing on Ubuntu linux is horrible.  The install thinks it requires libqt4-gui but doesn't actually need this package. 
** <pre>sudo dpkg -i --ignore-depends=libqt4-gui</pre>  worked for {{benthatmustbeme}} (see [https://askubuntu.com/questions/762462/vidyo-desktop-on-ubuntu-16]) it later causes issues installing any future packages and needed to be removed
