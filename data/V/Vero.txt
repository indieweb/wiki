'''<dfn>[https://vero.co Vero]</dfn>''' is an [[Instagram]]-like social network that is free for now but claims to be pursuing a model sustained by yearly fees and fees from in-app product sales instead of normal advertising models, and has been gaining publicity in February 2018, as well as quick public abandonment with the hashtag #deletevero.

It supports [[bookmarks]]/links, [[listen|listens]] for music, [[watch|watches]] for movie/tv, [[read]] related posts for books, [[location]], and [[photos]] as post kinds in addition to being able to share with a variety of predefined [[audience|audiences]].

=== Alleged labor violations by CEO ===
<blockquote>"Throughout his time there, the company was plagued with problems and allegations of abuse; under Hariri’s watch, over 31,000 complaints of nonpayment of wages were filed against the Saudi Oger."</blockquote>
