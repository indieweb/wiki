== WhisperFollow ==
[https://github.com/acegiak/WhisperFollow Whisperfollow] is a [[Wordpress]] plugin developed by [[user:acegiak.net|Acegiak]] that allows people to subscribe to rss/atom and mf2 feeds and display items from those feeds in a combined stream like a [[tumblr]] dashboard or a [[twitter]] feed.

It relies on the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/ json-api plugin] and the [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy indieweb-taxonomy plugin].

The wordpress blogroll is used as a subscription list and sites are parsed with MF2 if no rss/atom address is supplied.
