{{stub}}

'''<dfn>wall</dfn>''' is the original name for a feature launched on [[Facebook]] which is a user's stream of updates shown on their profile page, similar to the main stream of [[posts]] you might show on your indieweb [[homepage]], however with key innovations such as allowing your friends to "write" (create) posts on your wall, and also showing others' public posts that [[person-tag]] you.

Since its launch, Facebook has renamed the "wall" feature to "timeline", but the term has been in use so long that it's still used.
