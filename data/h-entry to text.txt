{{stub}}

'''<dfn>h-entry to text</dfn>''' is a method of taking an [[h-entry]] and converting it into a human-readable sentence describing the h-entry, in particular for [[interactions]] with [[posts]].

== Examples ==
=== Likes ===
* "{author} liked a post {post URL}"
* "{author} liked a post that linked to {post URL}"

In some cases it may make sense to include the URL of the h-entry in the sentence, such as when the sentence is sent via a plaintext channel such as IRC or text message. 

* "{author} liked a post that linked to {post URL} ({like URL})"

=== Replies ===
* "{author} commented on a post that linked to {post URL} ({comment URL})"

=== Reposts ===
* ...

aside: possible use of silo-specific verbs for reposts like: retweet, reshare

=== RSVPs ===
* ...
