== Issues ==
=== Content Deletion ===
YouTube has been known for deleting content that has been posted there:
* http://www.rebelliouspixels.com/2013/buffy-vs-edward-remix-unfairly-removed-by-lionsgate
=== Content Reappropriation ===
YouTube has also re-appropriated content without permission, transferring ownership to big media companies claiming copyright:

==== Copyright Claim ====
===== Copyright claim on unmatched audio =====
* on 2015-08-07 {{aaronpk}} livestreamed an event which was recorded to Youtube
* on 2015-08-10 Aaron noticed that Youtube placed ads on the video because of a copyright claim.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-08-10#t1439224857562] The part of the video in question was from timecode [https://youtu.be/uJov2cohGvQ?t=5s 0:05 to 1:56], the very beginning of the livestream, where the video is mostly dead air.
* the same day, Aaron filed a dispute on the claim
* on 2015-09-02 Aaron checked back on Youtube (since no notifications were being sent about any of this) and noticed that the copyright page now showed a link "Appeal rejected dispute". He submitted an appeal to the rejected dispute. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-02#t1441223499446] [https://farm1.staticflickr.com/624/21094658515_faf9bbd510_o.png]

===== Copyright claim on licensed work =====

=== Link Wrapping ===
YouTube links outbound links from posted content in <nowiki>www.youtube.com/redirect?q=</nowiki> URLs.
=== Unequal treatment of indie artists ===
* 2014-06-19 <cite>[http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/19/youtube-music-video-blocking/ YouTube won't block music videos from Indie labels, but it won't pay them either]</cite> <blockquote><p>[...] Labels who haven't signed up to the website's new terms, the majority of which are independents like XL Recordings, will have their artist channels blocked in the next few days.  ... labels who won't sign up to the paid tier are also kicked out of YouTube's ad-supported monetization scheme. So while we may still be able to find Lotus Flower on a Radiohead fan's channel, the band itself won't get a single penny.</p><p>[...] YouTube isn't even playing fair, offering "highly unfavorable and non-negotiable terms" which undercut the fees paid to Spotify, Rdio and Deezer, as well as being '''less generous than the money paid to the major labels like Warner, Sony and Universal.''' [...]</p></blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.

=== Lack of 3rd party copyright claim challenge ===
If you embed a YouTube video in one of your posts, and at some point in the future the video is taken down with just static in its place and "This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by ...", then there is no way for you as a 3rd party to evaluate and challenge the copyright claim.

Real world IndieWeb example(s):
* 2015-08-20 https://jeena.net/notes/423
** 2015-09-02 (13 days later) author noted that video was deleted

=== Requires Javascript ===
Videos do not play if javascript is disabled. No message or alternate player is shown on youtube.com. Embedded videos display a message "Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser."
