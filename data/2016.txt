If you are flying in to the PDX airport, the MAX will drop you off downtown a few blocks from the venue. It costs $2.50 for a ticket. [https://goo.gl/maps/sdz4gYtrFUs Public Transit directions]

==== Lyft / Uber ====
You can also take Lyft or Uber from the airport, they will pick you up in the lower level, in a section named "Transportation Network Companies." The cost will be about $18-22 for UberX. More info on the [https://newsroom.uber.com/us-oregon/uberx-is-taking-off-at-pdx/ Uber blog].

If you want to take a local cab, Aaron recommends calling Radio Cab (503-227-1212) when you are just outside security, and they will meet you in the lower level for pickup. Alternately, there is usually a line of cabs ready to take people in the lower level.
