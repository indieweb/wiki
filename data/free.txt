'''<dfn>free</dfn>''' could refer to no charge, or freedom, as in the freedom to fork an open source project, and ship it yourself.

== Criticisms ==
=== Unpredictable ===
If a service is free, that is, you're not paying for it, it lacks financial incentive to be around for you to use. The expectation is that [[site-death]] is more likely, and expected to be sooner, for free services, or that free services will eventually need revenue and change features or behaviors in order to get that.
