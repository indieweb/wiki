{{stub}}

'''<dfn>410</dfn>''' is the HTTP status code for GONE, meaning whatever URL was requested is not there any more, and used in [[webmention]] [[CRUD]] to indicate that a source has been [[deleted]].

"Any more" is important. A 410 response differs from a 404 in that a 404 states that the resource doesn't exist but lacks context on whether it might have existed in the past or future. A 410 states that the resource no longer exists, but did in the past. 

That also implies that the current server has knowledge on the past state of the requested URL.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of IndieWeb sites serving permalinks with status code 410 to indicate deletion.
* {{nekr0z}} uses 410 in both HTTP headers and tombstones' <code>http-equiv</code>: https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/reactions/2021/webmention-rocks-delete-1/

== Silo Examples ==
=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] uses 410 for removed features, e.g.:
* https://github.com/snarfed/color/branches/references

== http-equiv workaround ==
As with other HTTP headers, if your website is hosted so that you can't control the status code returned by the server (one common case is [[Netlify]]), you can use <code>http-equiv</code> attribute instead. For example, the following tag can be used inside the <code><head></code> of your [[tombstone|tombstones]]:

<code><meta http-equiv="Status" content="410 Gone"/></code>
