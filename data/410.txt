{{stub}}

'''<dfn>410</dfn>''' is the HTTP status code for GONE, meaning whatever URL was requested is not there any more, and used in [[webmention]] [[CRUD]] to indicate that a source has been [[deleted]].

"Any more" is important. A 410 response differs from a 404 in that a 404 states that the resource doesn't exist but lacks context on whether it might have existed in the past or future. A 410 states that the resource no longer exists, but did in the past. 

That also implies that the current server has knowledge on the past state of the requested URL.
