Survey results presented:

* https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=wjq533toracp6&question=1&filter=&rw=1

===Positive reasons===
* Customizing the look & feel
* Makes it easier to search through your content
* Professionalism
** Easier discovery -- e.g. avoids multiple profile confusion
** personal brand; design skills; nunchuck skills
* <del>No Censoring - say whatever you want!</del>
** autonomy, nobody can stop me from what i'm doing; different than anonymous
* Something you identify with
** especially email – instead of being "Jan of Gmail", which is endorsement in a way; use own domain for content and email – even if you route it to Gmail
** (What your email address tells about your computer skills: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/email_address )
* 5 whys: 
** autonomy; you're in control of it; you can take it with you; number portability; email portability; strategy for email migration; archival of content is the problem
** affiliation with the company; often linked with autonomy
*** Is there a positive affiliation? Captain planet
*** more like external; show someone else you're affiliated; where as autonomy is internal; that you are in control
** appreciation; i have to keep updating my address book
** status; perceived as cool
** (the sixth why) privacy
* Metrics; who checks my site?
** Ego; status
** Why don't you get this for Facebook?
** Hosting your own analytics software (e.g. piwik) for control over your data
* Being on the forefront of something new
** Freedom to upgrade to the latest thing, not restricted by devs elsewhere
** Equally, freedom *not* to upgrade
*** E.G. public outrage at FB ui+ux changes
* Personal & personal brand
* Technical: Convenience for hosting a page; technical freedom
** similar to email, even when you’re on Github pages you can use your own domain to hide the fact
* Animated gifs!!!
* Personal expression; can't set background color like myspace, embeds; can't type more stuff
** customization; feel
* Discovery; Facebook page can't link to everything; personal site can; central hub for you
* Pulling responses to content from around the web back to the original, all in one place
** See http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed
** life stream
* Freedom to choose monetization (or not); how people pay for the content
** could pay myself; or pay to tumblr
** Flattr?
* Family sites
** extended family sites
** age-independence; kids can participate
** computing eduction benefits: educates kids about the web
** multiple people participating together; collaborative site; part of a group
** firstname.familyna.me, firstname@familyna.me
* Archivability; static site generator; value in private mirrors; always have a copy
* Learning experience of creating a site; Ham radio argument
** bicycle maintenance
** cooking
* When you die; you can say who gets your data
** put your domain name in your will
** memorial experience on facebook
* Ownership
** artistic: People are proud of what they own
** date: People own their copyright
* Part of a cool club: it’s hard but you can do it
** Fixie bikes
** You can sign up for IndieWebCamp
** We all met

Reading List: Where can we refer people to (apart from IWC Wiki) for good reasons for #indieweb?
* http://NoMoreSharecropping.org
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/articles/chopped-up-cloned-you-choose

Use five core concerns to build better relationships.
* Express APPRECIATION – listen to your coworker’s perspective, find merit in it, and communicate your understanding.
* Build AFFILIATION – look for ways to connect; face challenges together, side-by-side.
* Respect AUTONOMY – be careful not to tell the other what to do.
* Acknowledge STATUS – respect the experience and expertise of the other; when status is recognized, people feel more calm, relieved, and relaxed.
* Make ROLES more fulfilling – help people craft roles that are meaningful and effective.

– from Roger Fisher and Daniel Shapiro, Beyond Reason: Using Emotions As You Negotiate http://alexlinsker.com/82/

5 basic User Experience principles, fulfilling the human needs for
* autonomy
* competency
* stimulation (self-oriented)
* relatedness
* popularity (others-oriented)

Improvements to the Survey questionnaire:
* question: Do you know what a domain name is?
* every question should have one free-form field
* "How much do you spend a month?" should have 0 as choice
