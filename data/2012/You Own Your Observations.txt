'''Proposed by [[User:Benatkin.com|Ben Atkin]]''' 

The TOS of twitter says that you own what you post, but what can you do with it? Twitter doesn't have a list of hashtags for a user, so it's hard to search, and there's also no way to plug in a date and see tweets on that date.

Also there are some things I'd like to keep private, or think about for a while before posting, and it isn't until I've already typed it that I find this out.

What I want is another way to post observations that is as convenient as twitter, but lets me share, or not, as I see fit. I want it to keep a private, searchable log, of everything I post. Ideally entries would be versioned too.

I have a project I started a while back called [https://github.com/fluxnote/fluxnote FluxNote]. The README has some goals. I got stuck but figured out the thing I got stuck on when I made [https://github.com/benatkin/justtweet Just Tweet]. I plan to hack on FluxNote some this weekend.
