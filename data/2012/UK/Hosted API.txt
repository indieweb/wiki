The idea of this session is to work out how a package of self hosted tools, that can be installed easy by any new indie web creator/ site owner.

This suite of pre-packaged tools, will allow for syndicating to third part websites via a plugin architecture, this allows for features such as:
* Syndicate third party social status updates
* Storage of content-types locally with a good structure
* Allow development of new 'plugins'
* Make it easy to create shortened URLs to content 
* Work out an API REST-Like URL format to allow for transmission of content.
* Discussion of how Clients (Mobile Web/Native Client/Web Browser) can post to an indie web site.
