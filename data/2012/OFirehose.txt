OFirehose -- firehose for the open web #ofirehose 

Participants:
* Evan Prodromou (session leader)
* Reid
* Mime
* Joseph
* Travis
* Rabble
* Don Park
* Julien Genestoux
* {{tantek}}
* Brennan Novak

Superfeedr: provide the infrastructure to to PubSubHubbub
* next step: add ability to multiplex the feeds
** e.g. any mention of "Evan Prodromou"
** or within a geo fence
** or with a min number of subscribers
* does provide Firehouse for some of the hubs they host
** some small private hoses
* we only have subscribed firehoses - only includes stuff that someone subscribes to.

Evan: people ask me for a statusnet firehose.
* for all statusnet instances on any server/site
* statusnet instances are their own instances

Use-cases:
* Developer convenience - go to a single URI rather than having to subscribe
* Sentiment analysis
* Search engine
** can subscribe to popular keywords to prepopulate search
* Google Alerts approach (keyword notifications)
* Conference updates screen (all posts/photos with a certain hashtag)

Google's use of PuSH
* they put results in search immediately
* they use it for deduplicating - first post instance wins : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LsB19wTt0Q - Matt Cutts interview
* ...

How do people feel about aggregating their posts into a firehose?

* OK, especially if it links back to original site
** "I don't want to have someone sell my blog posts on a CD." -Tantek

Garden Hose vs. Fire Hose

Twitter gives some % of their Fire hose openly? Maybe 2%
