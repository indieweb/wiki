Use Coda - Diet Coda on an iPad

Edit the widget - and add a "rel" field

add to the configuration file / structure:
* "rel" => "me"

That alone was insufficient

Looked for "a href" instead.

After each of those, typed in 
* rel="{rel}" e.g. along with href="{url}"

Used a tool called "Snoopy" (bookmarklet in Safari) to view the source of what his blog was generating.

then looked again in the PHP

copied a str_replace line with {url}

repeated it

changed {url} - {rel}

that didn't work

then tried copying the line with {image}

repeated it

changed {image} to {rel}

saved it

then on each item in the array, added a default "rel=" => "me"

checked in Snoopy

refreshed, all the lines looked great

then went back to IndieWebCamp.com and logged in no problem.
