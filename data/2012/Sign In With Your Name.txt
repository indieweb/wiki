'''Sign up & sign in with your name!'''

The problem with most identity services is that people need to remember a username, address, additional password or service.
How can we enable people to simply use their own name to sign in – and also to initially sign up?

Starting point: Identity review https://etherpad.mozilla.org/indiewebcamp-review


'''Proposal:'''
Just type in your name (any piece of identification) on a website, then you are searched and provided with identification & authorization mechanisms. Like IndieAuth, but without your website as central provider of your info.

Possible pieces of identification that you could put in the input field:
* '''your name''' (any part)
* email address / Webfinger
* Facebook link
* @twitterhandle
* [[OpenID]]
* your website
* any combination of keywords ("facebook <name>")
* really anything that relates to you

Then search and show with focus on names, not services. With photo and full name. Probably also expose the existing user list or prioritize that somehow to make subsequent log ins easier.

Sources:
* web search
** Google search (no API? scrape instead)
** Bing http://www.bing.com/toolbox/bingdeveloper/
** DuckDuckGo
* APIs: Twitter, Github, Facebook
* existing user database (easier second time sign in)
** implemented by http://BagCheck.com
* friends of users
* your website with links to services you use
** implemented by http://indieauth.com

Which points to a load of text files like http://www.gstatic.com/s2/sitemaps/sitemap-00039347.txt
Of which every one of them links to a load of Google+ profiles.
