Questions
* How do we get big companies to adopt open protocols?
* What challenges have each of you encountered?
* How do we avoid the problem of new solutions just being too complex for individuals and end up just using a hosted service again anyway?
** We are building first and foremost for ourselves, in terms of ease of use and ability to maintain
* How can I keep my stuff over time?
** one risk: on someone else's hardware - they go away, my stuff goes away
** other risks: data loss due to no backup, changes to formats, 3.5" floppy, JPEG?, Unicode? keeping stuff is hard.
* The LockerProject - github - no significant commits for the past 7 months - what happened?
** Singly had a hard time figuring out how to monetize it. 
** Singly is moving more toward a complete API to connect social services.
