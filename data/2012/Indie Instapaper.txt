== Notes ==
like a [[del.icio.us]] clone - post urls, special read later tag

One possibility: Bookie http://docs.bmark.us/en/latest/index.html
I know nothing about it, but it was mentioned to me as an Instapaper / Read it Later-like alternative.

Unpapered? http://geal.github.com/Unpapered
* you need a remoteStorage provider for that: http://unhosted.org/#remotestorage
* has a bookmarklet
* UX is not great at the moment, but Iâ€™ll make sure that improves

[[Evernote]] can be used to take a snapshot of a page. They have a product called Clearly which takes a "readable" snapshot like Instapaper. Perhaps a bigger indie repository that also holds bookmarks and notes would be a good place to save this content.
