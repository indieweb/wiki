=== Own Your Comments ===
'''Proposed by [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]''' 

This session is about IndieWeb Commenting and feedback systems.

What does it mean to post a comment in an indie web? As the author of a comment, you should own and control it, most likely you should post it on your own site. But we still want to have the benefits of centralized commenting systems like seeing a list of all comments left on a post, filtering spam comments, etc.

One way to handle comments is through the pingback or trackback protocols, both of which are widely implemented in many major blogging platforms. We can discuss the merits and drawbacks of each, and other possible solutions. A workshop session could involve implementing trackbacks/pingbacks on your own site, or implementing a new mechanism for using them.

=== You Own Your Observations ===
'''Proposed by [[User:Benatkin.com|Ben Atkin]]''' 

The TOS of twitter says that you own what you post, but what can you do with it? Twitter doesn't have a list of hashtags for a user, so it's hard to search, and there's also no way to plug in a date and see tweets on that date.

Also there are some things I'd like to keep private, or think about for a while before posting, and it isn't until I've already typed it that I find this out.

What I want is another way to post observations that is as convenient as twitter, but lets me share, or not, as I see fit. I want it to keep a private, searchable log, of everything I post. Ideally entries would be versioned too.
