see and review related session from: OSBridge BarCamp day 2012-181:
* http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/2012/Foursquare_is_down

=== Scenarios ===

==== Check in to a venue and get a discount ====

* You walk in to Starbucks, you want to let Starbucks now
* The starbucks wifi recognizes you're there and connected, and can verify the checkin
* do we care about actual verification that they were there? multiple ways: wifi, display a code on a phone

<pre>
( site )  ---->   [ business ]
</pre>

==== Public Checkin ====

<pre>
( site )  ----->  feed+push to your followers
              ----->  vendor API call (silo)
</pre>


==== Private Checkin ====

<pre>
( site ) -----> vendor API call (silo, with "off-the-grid" flag)
            -----> future: feed+push to your friends (authenticated)
</pre>


==== Group Checkin ("I'm here with _____") ====
<s><pre>
( site )   -----> feed+push to people tagged
             -----> vendor API call (some will support tagging people)
</pre></s>
tagging people in checkins should be a part of all types


==== Sharing with private friend groups (like Foursquare friends) ====

<pre>
( site ) ----> HUB
vs
( site ) -----> peers
</pre>

=== Venue ===
* URL of the venue's website
** some venues don't have websites
** starbucks.com is not one store
* use local place URL and find equivalents on other services
** factual has a crosswalk API: http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Places+API+-+Crosswalk
* wikipedia, open street map
* there is no one answer for a places database

* I want to own the URL for the venue I'm checking in to
** publish an hcard on my site
* a checkin is a link to a URL which is an hcard describing the venue
** the links can contain rel-canonical to the source
* You lose the ability to say "who is checked in at the same place I am"


=== Venue payload: ===
* URL to a venue page with hCard of adr/geo/URLs (to vendor specific venue URLs)
* geo data (lat/long/alt/error) of actual physical location
