{{stub}}

'''<dfn>js;dr</dfn>''' is [[JavaScript]] required; Didnâ€™t Read. See also: http://tantek.com/2015/069/t1/js-dr-requires-javascript-dead

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} lost the 1999 version of his website, and archive.org only has the front page because many pages were hidden behind Javascript popup window links.

== Web Content Examples ==
Examples of primarily content-based sites that are js;dr, in other words, have no real excuse other than poor engineering (or paying for poor engineering)

=== Huffington Post ===
Huffington Post articles are js;dr as noted https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/651165250666938369

=== Pacific Standard ===
If you load the [http://www.psmag.com/ Pacific Standard] without JS, you get a blank page.

=== The Mill ===
http://www.themillsf.com/ is a San Francisco based cafe and bakery that serves pizza on Monday nights.

* Solution: create your own indie [[venue]], and in the link to their own home page, add caveats like WARNING: Unreadable on some browsers due to Javascript. See js;dr for more.

=== Open Switch ===
* http://www.openswitch.net/

What should be a very simple content-based website is rendered by Javascript instead. The initial view shows a loading icon which then renders the page after a few seconds.

=== Security Trap ===
Articles on securitytrap.com, e.g.:
* http://www.securitytrap.com/mail/bugtraq/2004/Oct/0287.html (found via https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=30609 related to [[curl]] function in [[PHP]])
ironically are empty without JS enabled: <blockquote>This site requires JavaScript and Cookies to be enabled. Please change your browser settings or upgrade your browser.</blockquote>

As predicted in the js;dr post[http://tantek.com/2015/069/t1/js-dr-requires-javascript-dead] - that securitytrap.com article is dead to history - the archive.org copy is empty of any content:
* http://web.archive.org/web/20080401235506/http://www.securitytrap.com/mail/bugtraq/2004/Oct/0287.html

=== Other ===
* ... add other js;dr content-centric examples here, along with suggested workarounds

== Silo Examples ==
=== Blogspot ===
Google's [[Blogspot]] weblog hosting [[silo]]'s new (2014 and later?) templates tend to be js;dr, completely unnecessary and undesirable for a content-centric service. E.g. as tweeted: https://twitter.com/parkr/status/651142997564755968

[https://twitter.com/parkr/status/651142997564755968 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQlTGygVEAAImSG.png]

== Web App Examples ==
=== Google Maps ===
If you load [[Google Maps]] without JS, you get a cheeky error message:

[[File:googlemapsjsdr.png|700px]]

== The New Flash ==
Other (perhaps "artistic") examples which in the 1990s/2000s would have been built and deployed with Flash/SWF, and yet now depend on JS and perhaps other technologies designed to replace many old Flash use-cases.
=== networkeffect io ===
The site networkeffect.io when browsed without JS on, says: <blockquote>To view this website, please enable JavaScript in your browser.</blockquote>
If you do enable JS, and your browser supports whatever JS their site has, you might see a screen like:

Thus elevating WebGL to one kind of "New Flash". (As discovered from https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/651482137464541184 )

At a minimum the site should have a static text description, with perhaps a static image screenshot of what the WebGL would render by default.
