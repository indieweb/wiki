{{aaronpk}} has posted several public photo albums on Flickr:
* https://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/sets/72157647960517594

Flickr albums have:
* a featured cover photo
* a name
* a description
* photos can be ordered within the album

The Flickr API supports updating the order of the photos within an album. To specify an order for items in an album, the request simply includes the list of items you want to change, in the new desired order. [https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.reorderPhotos.html] The benefit of this that it works on any subset of the photos in the album, regardless of whether the interface is operating on a small subset of the album.

=== Google Photos ===
{{aaronpk}} has created a couple public and private albums on Google Photos:

== Difference from Multi-Photo ==
While both [[photo-album|photo albums]] and [[multi-photo]] posts contain multiple photos, the main difference seems to be that a single photo can appear in multiple photo albums, and each photo in an album has its own URL with its own properties such as name, tags, etc, and each individual photo can usually accept comments independent from the album. With a [[multi-photo]] post, the post as a whole has properties such as name, tags, etc, but the individual photos within it do not have their own post URL and are just the raw image URL.
