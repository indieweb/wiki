'''<dfn>Welcoming</dfn>''' is how we as a community welcome new members to our community.

Most often people join on [[IRC]] (it's prominently suggested here).

== indiewebcamp-vis ==
When someone joins the IRC channel as "indiewebcamp-vis" - it means they followed the web client link on the [[IRC]] wiki page. They might need some help engaging in the channel. Start with:

* '''Welcome indiewebcamp-vis! Go ahead and use the /nick command to change your name. e.g. /nick yournamehere'''

And then when they've done so, e.g. identified themselves as "Alice", see the next section:

== new person ==
When a new person, say, "Alice", joins #indiewebcamp, here are some things you can say and ask to make them feel welcome and help get them on board and taking steps towards being on the indieweb.

* '''Welcome Alice!'''
* '''Alice - go ahead and add yourself to http://indiewebcamp.com/irc-people'''
** This request will usually be enough to indirectly get the new person to wonder what their personal domain is (or should be), and if they don't already have one, they'll hopefully start asking how to set one up.
* '''What's the next thing you want to do with or add to your personal site?'''
** The point of this question is start getting the new person thinking in terms of:
*** scratching your own itches
*** [[selfdogfooding]]
*** [[wikifying]] - adding such personal site itches to their "User:" page on the wiki

== Redirect Hypothetical Discussions ==
Off-topic, hypothetical, or rambling discussions tend to drive out more useful, practical, actionable conversation (and people!) in the channel, thus we must proactively respond and redirect such discussions to more productive ends.

If a new person, say, Bob, joins #indiewebcamp and starts discussing (i.e. rambling about) some random subject X (e.g. previously undocumented/unmentioned on/in indiewebcamp), it can be unproductive for everyone, both existing active IRC users, and new/quiet folks looking to learn immediately practical things about the indieweb.

Your goal as an experienced #indiewebcamp participant and overall [[positive community]] contributor is to redirect Bob's enthusiasm from any/all hypothetical/rambling discussions of subject X to:
* '''Practical''' indieweb-specific discussions of subject X
* '''[[wikify]]''' indieweb-relevant aspects of subject X, assuming Bob supports X on their personal site.
* '''Blog on their own site''' about subject X, ''instead of'' discussing in #indiewebcamp IRC.
* '''Refocus Bob''' on understanding/documenting his '''personal site itches''' on their User: page
* '''Help Bob''' with their documented personal site itches

Thus when a new person starts a hypothetical discussion about some subject X, use the following to redirect them to practical discussions, with one or more prompts/questions as needed. Keep asking these questions addressed to them personally ("Bob, ...") until you get them to either [[selfdogfood]] or document hypotheticals elsewhere (rather than our IRC channel). It's important to keep addressing them personally in order to make it clear you are asking them for a response.

* '''Bob, do you support X on your personal site?'''
** if so: '''Bob, could you wikify X on indiewebcamp.com, and add yourself in an "IndieWeb Examples" section?'''
** if not: '''Bob, could you point to documentation elsewhere about X instead of discussing it here?'''
*** if they do provide a URL to actual documentation, then thank them, and create a small stub page linking to it.
*** if they do not point to documentation: '''Bob, before discussing it here in #indiewebcamp IRC, could you write up a blog post on your own site first?''' (with the implication that they should provide a link to that when they're done)
** if they do not point to document nor seem amenable to blogging about it, then you must redirect the conversation to their personal site itches instead of subject X:
*** '''Bob, what's the next most important thing ('itch') you want to improve or fix on your personal site?'''
*** and then ask them to document their itches on their User: page per '''[[wikifying]]'''.
*** once they have added one or more personal itches to their Use: page, perhaps most importantly, <em>help them</em> (if you can) with the first thing on their list.
*** enabling them to build something for themselves that they care about is *incredibly* powerful and compelling, and they will hopefully find much more sustainably motivating/interesting than carrying on a hypothetical discussion about subject X.

Exceptions:

There are some hypothetical exceptions that are ok and useful for #indiewebcamp discussions:
* If the discussion is admitted brainstorming that is *on topic* for the indieweb, especially the first time on a subject, help it move along and encourage incremental [[wikifying]] of the brainstorm, even if just encouraging capturing it on a User: page as a personal site itch to scratch.
