'''<dfn>[https://www.torproject.org/ Tor]</dfn>''' ('''T'''he '''O'''nion '''R'''outer) is ''"a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy"''[https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en].

== Hidden Services ==

Tor not only lets an end user connect to servers on the "clear internet" via [https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node exit nodes], but also lets nodes (including desktop computers) proxy services (TCP ports they're listening to) as [https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en hidden services] (where the entire route between user and service is hidden from tracking).

== Tor Browser Bundle ==

For end users (as opposed to servers running [https://www.eff.org/pages/what-tor-relay relays]), it is [https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia#Downloads recommended] to use the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29#Tor_Browser Tor Browser] bundle ''since it comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained''[https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en].

While tor browser is running, it also servers as a local node and enables users to launch ad-hoc hidden services (e.g. [https://onionshare.org/ OnionShare]) or persistent ones [where the user retains the private key to a .onion domain that can even be publicized] (e.g. [[HiddenID]]).
