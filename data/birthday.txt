A '''<dfn>birthday</dfn>''' is the date when someone is born, however in the context of the indieweb, it is a feature displayed on some silos' user profiles that you can (or must) enter, and some prominently present to your [[friends]] on the month and day of your birthday, like [[Facebook]]'s "BIRTHDAYS THIS WEEK" feature at the top of their [[events]] page.

with various privacy levels for the "Year":

== Criticism ==
Birthdays are often used by social networks to create spurious notifications - see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JAYEvvjXqU Friendster's line in this video]
