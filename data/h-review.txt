=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has posted reviews with h-review markup as of 2017-04-02. My intent was initially to post an [[recipe]] with a link to Blue Apron recipes I've enjoyed, then I realized it was easy to wrap in an h-review at the same time:

Previously I had posted a review as an [[article]], without explicit h-review markup:
