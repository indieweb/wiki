== How to ==

After picking the time we want to do it, we open the call for the participants. After the deadlines for the call for participants, the matching is done and each person get their match that they need to create something for. This person can indicate what they want to receive and what they don't want to receive and the person is asked to try to adhere to this if possible. This needs to be done by the deadline and dedicated to the gift participant. 

This event needs somebody to run it and that person is responsible for the matching of people and telling them how they are matched.

== Open Questions? ==

If you have an opinion on any of this questions or you have some other you want us to discuss, please put it below.

=== Is December the best time for this? ===

Considering we are already running [https://indieweb.org/2024-12-indieweb-gift-calendar Gift Calendar] in December, some other month might be a better fit for an event like that. Are there any other significant events, that are connected to the IndieWeb?

=== What kind of submission is welcome? ===

Considering the breath of the people in the IndieWeb, maybe it makes sense to either restrict it to the blog posts or to have separate events for wiki, blog post, design and code submissions. Or maybe some others as well.

=== Better name? ===

The Secret Santa was taken from the already existing fanfiction events, that served as inspiration. If anybody has a better name, please recommend it.
