== How to organise one ==

After picking the time we want to do it, we open the call for the participants. After the deadlines for the call for participants, the matching is done and each person get their match that they need to create something for. This person can indicate what they want to receive and what they don't want to receive and the person is asked to try to adhere to this if possible. This needs to be done by the deadline and dedicated to the gift participant. 

This event needs somebody to run it and that person is responsible for the matching of people and telling them how they are matched.
