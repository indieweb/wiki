'''<dfn>[https://indiewebguides.org IndieWebGuides]</dfn>''' is a documentation project {{calumryan}} started at [[2017/Nuremberg|IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2017]] following the outcome of previous [[onboarding]] sessions at IndieWebCamps. Itâ€™s a documentation of what the IndieWeb community is about written for and aimed at non-technical users. 

The structure and presentation of information draws on inspiration from sites including [https://www.gov.uk gov.uk]. Terms and technologies are categorised into select groups described by their overall purpose.

The aim of the site is to present and communicate in a language that a range of non-technical users will understand and feel more inclined to explore and participate in the community further. The style of writing attempts to consider different [[personas]] and how this relates to individuals in their own goals, behaviour and decision processes.

== Future development == 
There is ongoing work to develop the project further with more content along with open collaboration welcomed through [https://github.com/calumryan/indieweb-guides Github] to add more guides.
