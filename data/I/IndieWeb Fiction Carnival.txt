[[Category:Challenge]]

'''<dfn>IndieWeb Fiction Carnival</dfn>''' is a monthly fiction writing [[blog carnival]] inspired by the [[indieweb-carnival]] started in February 2026.

== Why ==
IndieWeb carnivals help motivate people to post more on their personal websites. 

And for all reasons why described in:
* '''[[why post|why post?]]''' 
* '''[[IndieWeb Carnival]]'''

== Who ==

''Anyone'' with a website is eligible to host and welcome to participate! 

=== How To Host ===

Each month, the IndieWeb Fiction Carnival has a different host. 

At the month's beginning, as host, create an announcement [[post]] talking about your prompt. Add that to the table of [[#Prompts_&_Hosts|prompts and hosts]]. Hosts add to that post as entries come in by webmention, email, or comment. At the month’s end, the host collects the received submissions and posts an overview of it at a new url and/or update the original announcement. 

To commit to hosting, sign up below!

=== How To Participate ===

Write a piece of fiction or poetry inspired by the prompt and notify the host.

== Current Rules (Can Change) ==

The rules are aligned with the rules for [[indieweb-carnival]] with a few tweaks.

=== For Host ===

At the month’s beginning, the host posts their chosen prompt as a post on their site. The host collects the submissions until the end of the month. After that, the host posts the summary of all interactions including links and sends them to the next month's host post.

The main way of people submitting are webmentions and email.

Ideally, when selecting a prompt, avoid ones that lean too heavily into something that may cause unease, or a genre that only interests a niche audience

=== Rules For Participants ===

Once you’ve written your fictional piece or poem, post it on your website. The post should be written in the month the prompt takes place. 

Then, submit your submission to the host via webmention or email.
