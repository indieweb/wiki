'''<dfn>IndieWeb for business</dfn>''' is the use of an indieweb site or section thereof for business purposes, to post professional products or services, announcements, reminders, and generally interact with business clients, instead of social media [[silo]] posts and pages.

__TOC__
=== Chris Aldrich ===
While not technically a for-profit business, {{chrisaldrich}} has a [http://lfl8424.boffosocko.com/little-free-library-8424/ website for a non-profit book exchange] (aka Little Free Library) which he uses for outreach to communities in traditional social silos. In particular it leverages [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] via [[Bridgy]] to help support the library and its mission.

=== William Hertling ===
* Author who uses his site to write about his process and sell books including a [[Books_about_the_IndieWeb|book about the IndieWeb]] entitled [http://www.williamhertling.com/?s=kill+process Kill Process].

=== Kevo ===
* A Glass blower. [https://kevo.glass Kevo] Marks up his gallery in h-product and uses [https://snipcart, a jQuery plugin that parses HTML data for third-party store). Kevo also uses [[Known]] as a company blog and syndicates all his artwork from Instagram using [[OwnYourGram]].

== Brainstorming ==
=== Reviews ===
* A traditional e-commerce website with [[webmention]] capability could accept [[review|reviews]] from sites on particular product pages and display them not as traditional [[comment|comments]] (or [[reply|replies]]) but in a product "Review" section. Since webmentions are bi-directional reviews could be more thoroughly audited and provide much more than the simple identities that are given on traditional e-commerce sites currently.

* One might use [[acquisition]] posts and [[webmentions]] to cross link products on websites to create "Verified Purchase" statuses for more reliable [[review|reviews]].

While there are a variety of companies that offer services used by IndieWeb sites for [[web hosting]], [[personal-domain|domain registration]], or other functionalities, the following are more consciously offering their services with indie web use in mind:
