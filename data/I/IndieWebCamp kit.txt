'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp kit</dfn>''' is a small minimum set of supplies that help to run an [[IndieWebCamp]] such as large sticky notes and Hello My Name Is name badges.

The following items have helped with running IndieWebCamps (and are not always easily available / findable on short notice or at local stores)
* Large (8x6") sticky notes for writing session proposals, e.g.:
** https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-Janeiro-Collection-6845-SSP/dp/B000CD0MHQ/
* Hello My Name Is name tags / stickers, e.g.:
** https://www.amazon.com/C-Line-Pressure-Sensitive-Badges-92235/dp/B002UIDXJK/
* Various [[stickers]] (IndieWebCamp, Microformats, Webmention, etc.)
** ping {{aaronpk}} for how to order these
* Files for posters explaining the [[building-blocks]] 
** e.g. https://github.com/sebilasse/indieweb-origami
* Pronoun pins
** [[pronoun#Pronoun_Badges|IndieWebCamp Pronoun Pins]]
** e.g. https://www.amazon.com/s?k=pronoun+pins&ref=nb_sb_noss_1
* Photography preference stickers / lanyards (red = no photo, yellow = ask)
** e.g. https://www.amazon.com/s?k=colored+stickers&ref=nb_sb_noss_2


If you're running an IndieWebCamp, make sure you have some on hand or
* order them online a week or more in advance
* '''Staples''' (or other office supply stores) may have some of these items as well

Other items that offices usually have:
* Sharpies or other medium size markers for writing session proposals on the large sticky notes
