'''<dfn>[https://www.inrupt.com/ Inrupt]</dfn>''' is a startup with the goal of “personal empowerment through data” (similar to the [[own-your-data]] IndieWeb [[principle]]), and is based on the [[Solid]] project, relying on [[Javascript]] and [[RDF]].

== Criticism ==
Inrupt has faced criticism for its [[#World_Domination_Inappropriate_In_2018_Global_Context|winner take all narrative]], venture funding model, and non-diverse hiring s to the Solid open source project that it builds upon.
=== Unrepresentative of web ===
Inrupt appears to exclusively have male employees: https://www.inrupt.com/meet-the-inrupters/
With a couple of white women contractors. Unrepresentative of users of the web.

** "Yes, let’s reinvent the web from scratch. We can get it right this time.  Step 1, hire only men, with a girl or two for HR & marketing. Step 2, hire as many white ppl as possible, definitely no black folks. <br><br>This will end up totally different. Totally better than the first time."

** "Read a start-up’s team page to see which people are employees, & therefore probaby have equity — and which work for an outside agency, & therefore likely don’t. Pay attention to, say, the gender or race of the people in each group. These are signals of the values of a company." [http://youtube.com/layoutland @jensimmons] October 1, 2018

Update:
* As of MozFest, they appear to have one woman employee. (citation forthcoming)
* Making assumptions about from profile pictures with filters may reduce agency of under represented people.

=== Requested volunteer diversity ===
In an attempt to respond to criticism about lack of diversity Inrupt volunteers, but apparently not acting in any official capacity for Inrupt, yet listed on website as an "[https://web.archive.org/web/20181104123541/https://www.inrupt.com/meet-the-inrupters/ inrupter]" amongst employees, tried to engage in the diversity conversation. This lead to criticism of relying on underrepresented population to make open source contributions not because of skill with code but to help address the diversity issue.

=== World Domination Inappropriate In 2018 Global Context ===
From: https://www.fastcompany.com/90243936/exclusive-tim-berners-lee-tells-us-his-radical-new-plan-to-upend-the-world-wide-web
<blockquote>“The intent is world domination,” Berners-Lee says with a wry smile. The British-born scientist is known for his dry sense of humor. But in this case, he is not joking.</blockquote>

In the global socio-political context of 2018 with nationalism (various countries) and fascism (Brazil 2018 election) on the rise, referencing "world domination" (whether jokingly or not) is inappropriate and does a disservice to / is insensitive to the under-privileged populations being actively harmed by worldwide political domination movements.
