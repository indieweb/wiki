'''<dfn>[https://www.inrupt.com/ Inrupt]</dfn>''' is a startup working on [[Solid]] that is being highly criticized for its non-diverse hiring while asking for unpaid diverse contributors to the Solid open source project.

== Criticism ==
=== Unrepresentative of web ===
Inrupt appears to exclusively have male employees: https://www.inrupt.com/meet-the-inrupters/
With a couple of white women contractors. Unrepresentative of users of the web.

** "Yes, let’s reinvent the web from scratch. We can get it right this time.  Step 1, hire only men, with a girl or two for HR & marketing. Step 2, hire as many white ppl as possible, definitely no black folks. <br><br>This will end up totally different. Totally better than the first time."

** "Read a start-up’s team page to see which people are employees, & therefore probaby have equity — and which work for an outside agency, & therefore likely don’t. Pay attention to, say, the gender or race of the people in each group. These are signals of the values of a company." [http://youtube.com/layoutland @jensimmons] October 1, 2018

=== Requested volunteer diversity ===
Context: in discussion of lack of diversity of Inrupt paid employees and contractors, requested diverse (unpaid) volunteers.
