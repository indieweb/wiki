'''<dfn>[https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1046583798752628736 Inrupt]</dfn>''' is a startup working on [[Solid]] that is being highly criticized for its non-diverse hiring while asking for unpaid diverse contributors to the Solid open source project.

== Criticism ==
=== Unrepresentative of web ===
Inrupt appears to exclusively have male employees: https://www.inrupt.com/meet-the-inrupters/
With a couple of white women contractors. Unrepresentative of users of the web.
...

=== Requested volunteer diversity ===
Context: in discussion of lack of diversity of Inrupt paid employees and contractors, requested diverse (unpaid) volunteers.
