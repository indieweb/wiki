An '''<dfn>ISP</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>internet service provider</dfn>''' is a company or organization that provides internet access.

ISPs offer internet access via a dedicated or shared cable connection or via satellite or cellular. Dial up internet access has largely fallen out of favor as connection speeds have increased, but is still used in some parts of the world.

The first ISP as we know it today -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20World%20(Internet%20service%20provider) The World] -- was started in 1989 in [[Boston|Brookline, Massachusetts]] and continues to operate as of [[2025]]. 

Historically, ISPs offered [[web hosting|personal web space]], a [[USENET|USENET feed]] and [[email provider|email services]] in addition to connectivity.

Some ISPs permit users to run servers from home, a form of [[self hosting]].
