We should capture recommendations for how projects under the GitHub org are managed so that they stay maintained.

* A clear readme
** Title
** Badges in the readme indicating CI status
** Basic documentation
** Contact info
* Multiple maintainers
* A [[CONTRIBUTING.md]] file
* Add a [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners code owners] file to indicate who the maintainers are and automatically assign them to review PRs
* Unit tests
* A changelog (either a separate file or GitHub releases)
* Use semantic versioning for releases
* Compatible with latest version of programming language and framework
* Be reviewed annually for active maintenance

=== Qualifications for inclusion ===

* IndieWeb relevance
* Some threshold of importance
* Used by the community (not just one person)
* An active maintainer
