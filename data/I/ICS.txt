{{stub}}

'''<dfn>ICS</dfn>''' (AKA iCal or iCalendar file / feed) is a format for calendar files (a form of [[feed file]]) used by many programs such as [[Apple Calendar]] and [[Google Calendar]], and can be used to share and subscribe to calendars across different systems.

== Why ==
You may want to publish a private (by obscurity) ICS feed on your site in order to subscribe to it from:
* [[Google Calendar]]
* [[iOS Calendar]] 
Both of which are useful calendar readers

== How ==
Publishing an ICS feed is a bit of non-trivial quirky work, as every "consuming application" (Calendar app) supports slightly different versions / overlaps of ICS.

You can either write code to generate your ICS (and cache it statically or generate it on request), or use a service like [[H2VX]] to convert  a page of [[hCalendar]] (or [[h-event]]s) into an ICS.
