'''<dfn>[https://indieweb.xyz Indieweb.xyz]</dfn>''' is a directory of Indieweb links, organized into ''subs'', similar to Reddit, but designed for self-promotion. All interaction with the site, such as links and upvotes, is performed by Webmention.

Indieweb.xyz takes the approach that self-promotion of your blog is not bad, it's necessary in order to find an audience when you're starting out or joining communities. However, you can only submit your link to one sub on the entire site. If the link is submitted to other subs, these are treated like "cross-posts" and are hidden by default on most subs.

== How to Post to Indieweb.xyz ==
* Write an essay or a note out on your blog as an entry. (Your blog entry must be an [[h-entry]].)
* Add a link in that blog entry to the indieweb.xyz sub you want to post to. (And that link must be marked as [[u-syndication]].)
* Publish the entry, sending Webmentions to Indieweb.xyz.

== Special Subs on Indieweb.xyz ==
/en/hottubs is the testing sub. Submitted links will not remain long there.

/en/ask-xyz is a sub that can automatically get cross-posted to. If you submit a link to /en/programming with the title "Ask XYZ: How Do I Connect to SQLite3?" then the link will also be cross-posted to /en/ask-xyz, because it starts with the phrase "Ask XYZ". Cross-posts are also not hidden on this sub.

/en/show-xyz works identically, but the phrase starting the post's title should be "Show XYZ".
