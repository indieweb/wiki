'''<dfn>[https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher Independent Publisher]</dfn>''' is an open source responsive and modern [[WordPress]] theme that is Indieweb friendly.

== Standards Support ==
It has reasonable [[microformats]] support:
* [[h-entry]]
* author [[h-card]]

It has additional code to handle:
* Receiving [[webmentions]] (and better support for backward compat trackbacks & pingbacks) and displaying them in its comments section.

== Issues ==
See (and add new issues to)
* https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher/issues

== Related ==
* An updated and maintained fork of Independent Publisher called [[IndieWeb Publisher]] is maintained by {{GWG}}. It streamlines some of the original themes' code and adds in some additional fixes to make the theme more IndieWeb [[friendly]].
* There is a separate and related, but forked, version of Independent Publisher in the WordPress.com repository that does '''not''' have these indieweb friendly elements.
