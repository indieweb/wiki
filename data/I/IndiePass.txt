=== Renaming ===

On 2021-12-21 {{marksuth}} posted that the app will be renamed to IndiePass in future updates. [https://marksuth.dev/renaming-indigenous/]

As brought up in [[events/2020-08-05-hwc-west-coast#Topics|HWC 2020-08-05]]:

What do people think of advocating for renaming Indigenous to something else?

The apps have nothing to do with actual indigenous people, and as such, the use of the term "Indigenous" is a kind of misappropriation, especially of/from a marginalized group.

Similar to the renaming of sports teams that have indigenous people based names that are unrelated, e.g. Washington Red Skins, Cleveland Indians, etc., the Indigenous apps should be renamed as well.

Note from the original creator {{eddiehinkle.com}}: I don't feel that "misappropriation" is the right term, as the word indigenous is an adjective with many meanings. Unlike sports teams and companies that create names for things from a specific culture or cultural identity the app wasn't named after indigenous people, but instead happens to use the same adjective as that noun. The apps were named because they were "innate; inherent; natural" (a dictionary definition) to the iOS platform. That said, while it's not misappropriation, I haven't been in love with the name for awhile and am fine with changing it, as being considerate of people's feelings are more important than a silly app name.


==== Naming thoughts and ideas ====
* +1 {{t}} yes to renaming. no real ideas yet, maybe IndieWeb Social Reader or Social Reader for short as a temporary placeholder? Update: I’d also prefer something at least semi-unique and searchable.
* +1 {{eddiehinkle.com}} yes to renaming. No ideas though.
* +1 {{chrisaldrich}} to renaming. Ideas:
** Watercooler
** Lunchroom (Touches on both "food/feeding" and the social conversation ideas)
** Commissary
** Barn Dance
** Pain Quotidien (or in English: Daily Bread) (We all need our social interactions and touches on the feeding bit again)
* +1 {{ana-r}} yes to renaming - ideas:
** Freewheel (I was chatting with a friend and I looked up "independent" on thesaurus and "freewheeling" was there which sounds a bit odd but we thought that "freewheel" doesn't sound too bad?)
* +0 {{realize.be}} I don't have strong feelings about the name. I just adopted it because it kind of felt good to have a consistent name for an IndieWeb reader across all platforms. No ideas for the name either. Note: I'm thinking to search for a new maintainer (for all platforms actually), so if anyone feels up for the task, give me a shout! '''Note''': updated the +1 to a more neutral one. I'm also non native English and I never had any problems with it. I also originally thought that the first part ('Indi') was referring to IndieWeb in general :) I agree with Peter that, in case a new name is chosen, it should be very unique.
* +0 {{petermolnar}} from non native English speaker perspective, the meaning of the word is OK - but for some reason, it's stupidly hard to remember the correct spelling. The benefit, however, is that it's unique. Please keep it that way, so searching for the app doesn't show anything else that it could be mistaken for.
* +1 {{jacobhall}} I understand that the name isn't terribly problematic, but I question if it invokes the right ideas of what the IndieWeb is about. I want to demonstrate IndieWeb technologies, celebrate others' work, and bring friends into the IndieWeb without needing to explain why the app is called Indigenous.
* 0 {{chrisbergr}} I like the name Indigenous. Anyways, my suggestion: '''Indiepass'''. Like a trail in the mountains. Or passing an exam. It's also a synonym for a gate.

==== Naming opinions ====
In alphabetical order. Please +1/0/-1 vote for the ones you like/meh/dislike with a brief reason why
* '''Barn Dance''' (or '''Barndance''', more searchable)
** +0 {{t}} sounds [[fun]], yet perhaps would work better for a video "reader", like an IndieWeb version of [[TikTok]]
** ...
* '''Commissary'''
** -0 {{t}} feels a bit military sounding
** ...
* '''Freewheel'''
** +1 {{t}} I really like this one. Great logo opportunities, and possible mottos too, like "Your bicycle for the IndieWeb". Fairly searchable too for web / reader contexts.
** -1 {{marksuth}} Same name as a Comcast brand, could cause issues.
** ...
* '''Indiepass'''
** +1 {{chrisbergr}} — suggested
** +1 {{t}} — sounds catchy/memorable, easy to say & type
** +1 {{marksuth}} - easy to spell, catchy and has easy branding potential
** ...
* '''IndieWeb Social Reader'''
** +0 {{t}} (suggestion as a placeholder)
** ...
* '''Ingenious'''
** +1 {{t}} — this will be recognizable as similar to the old name, probably better retention of current users. Also social readers are quite ingenious so the name is fitting :)
** +1 {{sebsel}} – with my limited knowledge of English I first thought the reader was called this already. I find this a very good replacement.
** +1 {{capjamesg}} - easy to remember.
** -1 {{marksuth}} - sounds more like a quiz app than a social app to me.
** ...
* '''Lunchroom'''
** +1 {{t}} — this is playful, [[fun]], and looks looks pretty clear of any conflicts
** +1 {{capjamesg}} - agreed, this is a playful name and speaks to the nature of the app as somewhere to go to consume all sorts of content (akin to a lunch room).
** ...
* '''Reblog'''
** +1 {{fluffy}} Represents a return to blogging, and is a common term from existing social platforms (particularly Tumblr) without being specifically tied to one in particular
** …
* '''Scrivener'''
** +1 {{petermolnar}} I checked for obscure synonyms on 'scribe', this is a surprisingly nice fit. 
** -1 {{fluffy}} Name’s taken by a [https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/ very well-known piece of writing software]
** ...
* '''Social Reader'''
** +0 {{t}} (suggestion as a placeholder)
** ...
* '''SoWeReIn - Social Web Reader for Indieweb'''
** {{petermolnar}} why not an acronym? Except I'm not too great with acronyms. 
** ...
* '''Watercooler'''
** +1 {{t}} — though there’s a potential collision with [https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/donut-watercooler/ this "product", Watercooler by Donut]
** ...
