'''<dfn>[https://github.com/posativ/isso isso]</dfn>''' is a self-hosted commenting server similar to [[Disqus]].

It is written in Python and supports features such as multi-tenant operation, built-in Disqus import (with an API for other comment sources), and a simple moderation queue with various notification mechanisms including SMTP. It is also built for smaller sites and uses a local SQLite database for its comment storage.
