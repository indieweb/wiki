{{stub}}

'''<dfn>In case you missed</dfn>''' is an annoying default-on [[notification]] from [[Twitter]] that adds to your [[notifications]] page every time someone you are following posts a tweet. Screenshots needed. See also [[antipatterns]].

* Criticism: The only option you are given in the web UI is to choose "See less often". There is no obvious way to turn off such "In case you missed" notifications from the [[notifications]] list page.
