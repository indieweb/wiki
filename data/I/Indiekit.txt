'''<dfn>[https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit/ Indiekit]</dfn>''' is an IndieWeb publishing toolkit, a [[project]] currently being developed by {{paulrobertlloyd}}.

The immediate goal of the project is to provide a [[Micropub]] endpoint that can be hosted on a service like [[Heroku]], configured via files stored on a [[GitHub]] repo, and save posts to that repo for publishing with a static site generator like [[Jekyll]], [[Hugo]] or [[Eleventy]]. All aspects of the software will be fully documented and tested, including tests that replicate those provided by the [[Micropub Rocks]]! validator.

A longer term ambition is to build a tool that supports more publishing destinations, other social publishing specifications ([[Webmention]], [[Microsub]], ActivityPub etc.) and integrates with a range of content management systems.
