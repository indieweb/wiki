'''<dfn>[https://getindiekit.com Indiekit]</dfn>''' ([https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit GitHub repo]) is “a small but powerful server that acts as the go-between your website and the wider independent web”. This [[project]] is currently being developed by {{paulrobertlloyd}}.

The immediate goal of the project is to provide a Micropub endpoint that can be hosted on a service like [[Heroku]] and save posts to a git repo for publishing with a static site generator. The software is fully documented and tested.

A longer term ambition is to build a tool that supports more publishing destinations, other social publishing specifications ([[Webmention]], [[Microsub]], ActivityPub etc.) and integrates with a range of content management systems.

== Features ==
* Publish content using apps and services that support the [[Micropub]] API
* Syndicate content to [[Twitter]] and save posts to the [[Internet Archive]]
* Save files to different content stores such as [[Bitbucket]], [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]] and [[Gitea]]
* Highly configurable, with publishing presets provided for [[Jekyll]] and [[Hugo]] static site generators
* Localisable, with initial support for English, French and German
