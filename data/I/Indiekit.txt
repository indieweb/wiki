'''<dfn>[https://getindiekit.com Indiekit]</dfn>''' ([https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit GitHub repo]) is “the little Node.js server with all the pieces needed to own your content and share it with the wider independent web”. This [[project]] is currently being developed by {{paulrobertlloyd}}.

The immediate goal of this project was to provide a self-hosted Micropub endpoint that could save posts to a content store (such as [[GitHub]]) for subsequent publishing with a static site generator (such as [[Jekyll]]).

With that goal met, the longer term ambition is to support other publishing APIs ([[Webmention]], [[Microsub]], [[ActivityPub]] etc.), integrate with a wider range of content management systems, and provide a compelling web management interface.
