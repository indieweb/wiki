'''<dfn>[https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-publisher IndieWeb Publisher]</dfn>''' is an open source fork of the responsive [[Independent Publisher]] theme for [[WordPress]] that streamlines its code and adds some additional IndieWeb [[friendly]] functionality to the original semantic theme.

The original theme was developed by Raam Dev and was extended by {{GWG}}. The source code is available on GitHub. Feedback and Pull Requests are more than welcome. As of 2019-02-01 this theme is not yet available in the main WordPress Theme repository, so it will need to be downloaded from GitHub directly.
