'''<dfn>[https://indieauth.net/ IndieAuth]</dfn>''' is a federated login protocol for [[Web sign-in]], enabling users to use their own [[domain]] to sign in to other sites and services. IndieAuth can be used to implement <strong>OAuth2 login</strong> AKA <strong>OAuth-based login</strong>.

IndieAuth is built on ideas and technology from existing proven technologies like [[OAuth]] and [[OpenID]] but makes it easier for users as well as developers. It decentralizes much of the process so completely separate implementations and services can be used for each part.

</div>

If you’re familiar with writing an OAuth client, then you're familiar with the problem of having to register your client manually with each OAuth provider. IndieAuth uses DNS as a replacement for client registration, thereby eliminating the need for any manual registration with providers.

<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px #ccc solid; background-color: #fffee7;"><p>'''Note:''' IndieAuth is often conflated with the [[indieauth.com|IndieAuth.com]] service provider. The first is the subject of this page: ''the way the IndieAuth protocol works''. The second is ''an implementation'' that most people will be familiar with because it is used on this wiki, and has been renamed to [[indielogin.com]]</p></div>

== Why ==

By choosing your IndieAuth provider, you can tell applications where to send you to sign in. This gives you more control over the privacy and security of your logins.

Most [[Micropub]] clients use [[IndieAuth]] to log you in, obtaining your authorization by directing you to your chosen IndieAuth server. This allows you to use your own website to log in to the tools you use to post content.

IndieAuth is part of taking back control of your online identity. Instead of logging in to websites as “you on Twitter” or “you on Facebook”, you should be able to log in as just “you”. We should not be relying on [[silos]] to provide our authenticated identities, we should be able to use our own [[personal domain|personal domains]] to log in to sites everywhere.

You can use it right now to log in to this wiki and contribute to the [[community]], including doing common things like:
* Adding yourself to [[chat-names]] after joining one of our [[discuss|discussion channels]], and
* RSVP to [[events|an upcoming event]].

== How it works ==
Basic flow with a user signing in to a (web) app
# '''The user fills in his/her personal URL''' This is called [[Web sign-in]].
# '''The app fetches the URL, looking for an authorization endpoint.''' For this, the user can use IndieAuth.com, but it can also be at their own domain. The app redirects the User to their authorization endpoint.
# '''The user authenticates at their own authorization endpoint.''' IndieAuth.com uses [[RelMeAuth]] to authenticate users, but if a user uses an authorization endpoint on his/her own site, it can be a password, e-mail link, or any other authentication mechanism the authorization endpoint provides. They prove their identity to their authorization endpoint while the app waits for them to complete.
# '''The authorization endpoint issues a temporary authorization code''', and sends it to the app by redirecting the user's browser back to the app.
# '''The app checks the code with the authorization endpoint''', and if the code is valid and if the user’s identifier matches the identifier the authorization endpoint gives, the login is completed, and the user can enter and use the app.

== How to ==
If all you're trying to do is log in to the wiki, then you may not need to set up IndieAuth at all! Instead, you can just link to your existing Twitter or GitHub accounts and the wiki will use those to authenticate you! See [https://indielogin.com/setup indielogin.com/setup] for more details.

=== Set up using IndieAuth.com ===
[[indieauth.com|IndieAuth.com]] is a service that allows you to sign in as your site by using your social media profiles. Your homepage and social media profiles need to link to each other for verification. Instead of registering for an account at indieauth.com, it uses your existing social media accounts to verify you own the URL you're signing in as.

# Add [[rel-me]] links to your homepage for various ways to reach you,<br>e.g. <code><nowiki><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk" rel="me">GitHub</a></nowiki></code>.
# Make sure any social media profiles you linked to have a link back to your homepage.
# Finally, include <code><link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth"></code> on your homepage.

You are done! Try to log in to a site that supports IndieAuth, such as:
* [https://indieweb.org/Special:UserLogin this wiki]
* [https://telegraph.p3k.io/login Telegraph]
* [https://pin13.net/login/ this demo page on pin13.net]

These services should redirect you to your chosen IndieAuth endpoint to sign in, which in this case is indieauth.com.

See: [https://indieauth.com/setup full setup instructions]

=== Set up in WordPress ===
If you use WordPress, you can install the [[Wordpress IndieAuth Plugin]] which provides a built-in IndieAuth server.

=== Set up your own IndieAuth provider ===
Use an existing [[#Implementations|implementation]] or [[authorization-endpoint|build your own!]]

[https://indielogin.com/api Read the full documentation]

=== IndieAuth.com ===
The IndieAuth.com service provides an authorization endpoint to bootstrap your [[Micropub]] server development. It lets you authenticate via GitHub, email, and PGP. Eventually this will be replaced with a new service, [[MyIndieAuth.com]], although development of that service has not yet begun.

Historically, IndieAuth.com also provided an API for developers to use to authenticate users, tho this is being phased out in favor of [[IndieLogin.com]].

[https://indieauth.com/developers Read the full documentation]

The [https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth.com IndieAuth.com source code] is available on GitHub.

== Supporting Sites ==
(This section is a stub and needs expansion!)

There are a growing number of web sites that you can log into using IndieAuth and gain additional functionality:
* [[Main Page|IndieWeb.org]]
** This site! Signing-in with IndieAuth enables you to edit the wiki!
* [https://telegraph.p3k.io/ Telegraph]
** [[Telegraph]] allows people to send [[Webmentions]] after logging in.
* Most [[Micropub]] apps use IndieAuth to sign in.
* ...

== Use with Micropub ==
<span id="Micropub"></span>

Most [[Micropub]] implementations use IndieAuth to obtain the user's authorization (and an access token), including:

* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub/ wordpress-micropub]

== IndieAuth Protocol ==

TODO: consider moving this to its own page, maybe on [[:Category:IndieAuth]].

A user should only have to communicate their own homepage URL to the website they are trying to log in to. This is the core idea of [[Web sign-in]]. This means a developer should in their turn be able to find everything they need on that one user supplied URL.

=== Discovery from the User's Homepage ===

IndieAuth defines two new [[rel-values|<code>rel</code> values]] for this. A user can simply link to the endpoints they want to use from their homepage, add the correct <code>rel</code> value and be done.

An example would be to link to them in the <code><head></code> section of their HTML, like so:

    <link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://example.com/auth">
    <link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://example.com/token">

Developers can discover these endpoints using traditional HTML or Microformats parsing.

=== The Authorization Endpoint ===

<p class="plainlinks" style="text-indent: 2em; font-style: italic;">See '''[[authorization-endpoint]]''' for implementation details.</p>

The authorization endpoint is a page where applications can send users to and asking them to identify themselves. Because the user defines their own endpoint on their homepage, this can be part of their own website or a completely separate service. This is how the user provides proof they really operate the homepage URL they provided.

An application can also ask the user to grant it certain rights by requesting them through the authorization endpoint. A [[Micropub]] client might ask to be allowed <code>create</code> rights. The user can then either accept these or not when they have been redirected to their endpoint.

For developers, the authorization endpoint also functions as a verification service. If they get a code from a user they can check its validity with the endpoint to make sure it was truly issued by the user.

==== Third Party Services ====

* [[IndieAuth.com]] has an authorization endpoint that lets you use [[silo]] accounts like [[GitHub]] or simple alternatives like [[email]] as authentication options. Use the URL <code>https://indieauth.com/auth</code> as your value for <code>authorization_endpoint</code>.
* [[commentpara.de]] allows anyone to (anonymously or pseudonymously) log in to websites supporting IndieAuth by using <code>https://commentpara.de/</code> as their homepage.
* See [[#Implementations|Implementations]] above for more details, or to find if your platform already has a built-in option.

==== Self-Hostable Implementations ====

* [[selfauth]] is an authorization endpoint in [[PHP]] made to be easy to deploy.
* [https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence Acquiescence] is an authorization endpoint in [[Ruby]] developed and used by {{barryf}}.
* [[Known]] enables an authorization endpoint when the [https://github.com/idno/Known/tree/master/IdnoPlugins/IndiePub IndiePub plugin] is turned on.
* [[Wordpress IndieAuth Plugin]] provides an authorization endpoint to WordPress sites.

=== The Token Endpoint ===

<p class="plainlinks" style="text-indent: 2em; font-style: italic;">See '''[[token-endpoint]]''' for implementation details.</p>

The token endpoint is a service that creates access tokens for applications to store and use in [[Micropub]] requests. After authorizing the application, the token endpoint creates a token that the application stores. The application will send it in a header when making a Micropub request, and the Micropub endpoint is expected to be able to validate the token while processing the request.

==== Third Party Services ====

* [[IndieAuth.com]] has a token endpoint. Use the URL <code>https://tokens.indieauth.com/token</code> as your value for <code>token_endpoint</code>.

==== Self-Hostable Implementations ====

* [https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence Acquiescence] is a token endpoint in [[Ruby]] developed and used by {{barryf}}.
* [[Known]] enables a token endpoint when the [https://github.com/idno/Known/tree/master/IdnoPlugins/IndiePub IndiePub plugin] is turned on.
* [[Wordpress IndieAuth Plugin]] provides a token endpoint to WordPress sites.


== FAQ ==
The IndieAuth.com FAQ is here:
* https://indieauth.com/faq

Feel free to add more questions here that seemed to be asked more than once.

=== How is IndieAuth different from OpenID Connect ===
{{main|How is IndieAuth different from OpenID Connect}}

=== Do I need a silo account ===
No silo accounts are required for IndieAuth services, but some may chose to use them as an authentication method.

See also [[indieauth.com#Do_I_need_a_silo_account|the answer to this question on the IndieAuth.com page]].

=== Do I need to enter my URL every time ===
Q: Do I need to enter my URL every time I log in to an app that uses IndieAuth?

Yes, like traditional username/password forms, you need to enter your URL when you log in to an app. Browsers will remember your URL you enter and will suggest it using their normal autofill mechanisms as well.

[[File:indieauth-autofill.jpg|300px]]

=== Should I use HTTPS ===

<span id="Security"></span>
<span id="Should_the_specification_make_recommendations_on_HTTPS.3F"></span>

The IndieAuth specification is an extension of OAuth 2.0, and [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.5 OAuth 2.0 recommends using https URLs] for everything. IndieAuth doesn't provide any new reason to require or not require https so delegates this recommendation to OAuth 2.0.

=== Why do I see form-encoded responses ===

<span id="IndieAuth_using_form-encoded_responses_instead_of_JSON"></span>

IndieAuth originally used standard form-encoding for requests and responses, since it has been a standard encoding format since the beginning of the web.

Over time, implementations added support for sending JSON responses as well as form-encoded. When IndieAuth was written up as a [https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth/ formal OAuth 2.0 extension], it documented only the JSON responses in order to be compatible with OAuth 2.0. At that point, most implementations already supported JSON responses, or did content negotiation to support both formats.

== Issues ==
For issues about the IndieAuth spec, please see the [https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues IndieAuth GitHub project].

For issues with the IndieAuth.com service, please see the [https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth.com/issues IndieAuth.com Github project].

<span id="naming_confusion"></span>
<span id="how_to_should_include_endpoint_definition"></span>

Older discussions and brainstorming has been moved to [[IndieAuth-brainstorming]].

We are currently working on moving the remaining sections below to either the IndieAuth GitHub project or the FAQ section above. Please open new issues on the respective GitHub projects above.

=== Need Simple Copy Paste How To ===
The explanation in http://waterpigs.co.uk/articles/indiewebcamp-signin-ux/ provides a list of three lengthy descriptions of what you need to set up IndieAuth, which was then subsequently criticized as "this is not a straightforward process" in the post: http://aralbalkan.com/notes/on-evolving-indieauth/

Thus we need a a simple copy paste how to that is not three lengthy descriptions.

Any explanation of how to use IndieAuth needs to start with a 1-2 sentence summary. No more. 

Compare with: 
* Introduction to Twitter Sign-in: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/sign-twitter
* How Facebook Connect works: http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=41735647130

Explanations for IndieAuth need to be <em>at least as simple to understand</em> as those for Twitter Sign-in and Facebook Connect.

=== IndieAuth using form-encoded responses instead of JSON ===
IndieAuth originally used standard form-encoding for requests and responses, since it has been a standard encoding format since the beginning of the web.

Over time, implementations added support for sending JSON responses as well as form-encoded. When IndieAuth was written up as a [https://www.w3.org/TR/indieauth/ formal OAuth 2.0 extension], it documented only the JSON responses in order to be compatible with OAuth 2.0. At that point, most implementations already supported JSON responses, or did content negotiation to support both formats.

<raw><details><summary>Historical Discussion</summary></raw>
IndieAuth uses standard form-encoding for requests and response because it has been a standard encoding format since the beginning of the web. If it were a JSON response, then 7 years down the road you'd be asking "why is the response in JSON instead of ____" where ____ is the next trendy thing that replaces JSON. (Remember when XML was the new hotness?)

Proposal for content negotiation: https://www.tuxed.net/fkooman/blog/proposed_changes_to_indieauth_protocol.html#content_negotiation &mdash; [[User:Wwelves.org perpetual-tripper|Wwelves.org perpetual-tripper]] 02:26, 5 March 2015 (PST)

* To me this would violate [[Postel's law]], requiring every implementation to publish many different formats. I don't care which format IndieAuth produces, but I do think we should settle on ''one'' canonical format. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 10:03, 5 March 2015 (PST)

* Agreed that there should be only one format. The only valid argument for JSON is that the OAuth 2.0 spec defines the response as JSON. <span class="h-card">[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 10:06, 5 March 2015 (PST)

* OK I withdraw my objection to content negotiation. Agree it is a relatively small burden on a relatively small number of providers; it's worth supporting multiple formats for convenience to the large number of consumers [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 12:06, 5 March 2015 (PST)

* Just to be anti-inventing-new-formats (too many of them around and demanding attention), I'd go for form-encoded -- {{kartik}} 00:21 2015-03-06

* I just never saw HTTP POST form encoded _responses_ anywhere, only POST url encoded form requests... Any link to other (REST) services that use this? e.g. XMLHttpRequest does not support form encoded responses at all... [[User:tuxed.net|fkooman]]
<raw></details></raw>

=== Requesting additional user details ===

The auth consumers may want to receive additional information about a user, and not just their homepage URL. Andy Baio raised some points in regard to this in a backer-only Kickstarter post, [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/the-return-of-upcomingorg/posts/1167812 Opening the Source and The Great Auth Debate], 2015-03-16, when deciding what authentication mechanism to use for [[Upcoming.org]].

* Silos may give the application access to the user’s social graph: who their friends are, who they are following.
** This would require some IndieWeb format for [[following]].
** This is great for applications like [[readers]] to start a user off.

* Silos may give the application location information about the user.
** This is great for applications like Upcoming.org that want to show relevant events.
** This is possible by parsing the homepage URL of the user for [[h-card]] or recent [[checkins]].
