'''<dfn>[https://github.com/chrisaldrich/iwtwentyfifteen IndieWeb Twenty Fifteen Theme]</dfn>''' or '''iwtwentyfifteen''' is an [[friendly|IndieWeb friendly]] forked version of the annual [[WordPress]] [https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/ Twenty Fifteen theme] that has improved support for [[microformats]] version 2. It is a relatively clean, simple, and responsive design which is well suited for use as a personal website.


== Child Theme ==
It is recommended, but not necessary, that one use this theme in conjunction with a [[WordPress/Themes#Child_Themes|child theme]] so you can make your own changes and customizations if necessary. 


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} modified the original theme in January 2019 and is [[selfdogfood|using it]] on his [https://www.boffosocko.com personal site].
* {{addyourself}}


== Features ==

=== Microformats 2 ===
Rough outline of the changes from the original:
* Modified the header.php file to remove the erroneous hfeed microformat that was being put on all pages.
* Changed the archive.php page to add h-feed and hfeed to create the appropriate feed pages (I need to doublecheck this in an actual reader, but it looks good on the page and seems to parse properly.)
* In the functions.php file, I’ve wrapped the_content in e-content, wrapped the_excerpt in p-summary
* In the functions.php file, I’ve added a filter that will add h-entry to the correct place.
* The meta data section of posts created by inc/template-tags.php has been modified to provide an h-card on posts. While not shown visually on the page, if users have a [[gravatar]] associated with their user account, it should be found by parsers and is able to be displayed when leaving responses on others' sites.

=== Brid.gy ===
Thanks to improved microformats support, this theme should be more compatible than most for use with [[Bridgy]] and particular [https://brid.gy/about#publishing Brid.gy publish functionality]. The [[Syndication Links]] plugin is a simple way to enable Bridgy publish functionality, if desired.

=== Webmentions ===
The function.php file has a [[WordPress_Webmention_Plugin#Automatically_approving|snippet for automatically approving Webmentions]]. This can be commented out for those who may have spam issues in the future.

=== Footer ===
* The footer includes [[badges]] to show support for IndieWeb and Microformats. If one adds the Webmention plugin, a line at the bottom of the footer.php file can be uncommented to reveal the Webmention badge as well.

== Customizer ==
This theme is still compatible with the WordPress customizer and has a few [https://wordpress.com/theme/twentyfifteen built-in options for changing] the theme's colors as well as adding header and background images to personalize it to one's taste.


== To do list ==
* For better Syndication Links plugin compatibility, move the syndication links meta into /inc/template-tags.php
* For better Simple Location compatibility, move the Simple Location meta output into /inc/template-tags.php
* If/then statement in footer.php to check for Webmention support to automatically show that badge which is currently commented out.
* Code for declaring microformats support to other plugins?
