'''[https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/ IndieKit]''' is an IndieWeb publishing toolkit, currently being developed by {{paulrobertlloyd}}.

The immediate goal of the project is to provide a Micropub endpoint that can be hosted on a service like Heroku, configured via files stored on a GitHub repo, and save posts to that repo for publishing with a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo or Eleventy. All aspects of the software will be fully documented and tested, including tests that repliacte those provided by the Micropub Rocks! validator.

A longer term ambition is to build a tool that supports more publishing destintions, other social publishing specifications (Webmention, Microsub, ActivityPub etc.) and integrates with a range of content management systems.
