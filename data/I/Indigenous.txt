'''<dfn>Indigenous</dfn>''' is a native app for iOS currently in beta that supports posting your website using [[Micropub]] and a built-in [[reader]] that supports [[microsub]]. There are also plans to develop Indigenous for macOS as micropub menu bar/share sheet application. 

This [[project]] is under active development by {{eddiehinkle.com}} and can be found on [https://github.com/EdwardHinkle/indigenous-ios GitHub].

= Future Development Ideas =

=== v2 ideas ===
* macOS Photos App Project to allow the development of a photo album that would be posted as photo posts as part of a collection [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-06-08#t1496941718536000 More context in the IRC].
* Voice posting for notes using Siri.
* Supporting multiple micropub accounts with a default one selected
* Notifications
** Forward mf2 json to your endpoint with a secret key to receive a push notification
*** Example: https://indigenous.abode.pub/eddiehinkle.com/notification would send a push notification to any app authenticated as eddiehinkle.com.
