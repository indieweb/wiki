Issues in general about Indigenous, not particular to a specific implementation (see GitHub issues links above for that).

=== Renaming ===
As brought up in [[events/2020-08-05-hwc-west-coast#Topics|HWC 2020-08-05]]:

What do people think of advocating for renaming Indigenous to something else?

The apps have nothing to do with actual indigenous people, and as such, the use of the term "Indigenous" is a kind of misappropriation, especially of/from a marginalized group.

Similar to the renaming of sports teams that have indigenous people based names that are unrelated, e.g. Washington Red Skins, Cleveland Indians, etc., the Indigenous apps should be renamed as well.

Note from the original creator {{eddiehinkle.com}}: I don't feel that "misappropriation" is the right term, as the word indigenous is an adjective with many meanings. Unlike sports teams and companies that create names for things from a specific culture or cultural identity the app wasn't named after indigenous people, but instead happens to use the same adjective as that noun. The apps were named because they were "innate; inherent; natural" (a dictionary definition) to the iOS platform. That said, while it's not misappropriation, I haven't been in love with the name for awhile and am fine with changing it, as being considerate of people's feelings are more important than a silly app name.


Opinions:
* +1 {{t}} yes to renaming (no real ideas yet, maybe IndieWeb Social Reader or Social Reader for short as a temporary placeholder?)
* +1 {{eddiehinkle.com}} yes to renaming. No ideas though.
* +1 {{chrisaldrich}} to renaming. Ideas:
** Watercooler
** Lunchroom (Touches on both "food/feeding" and the social conversation ideas)
** Commissary
** Barn Dance
** Pain Quotidien (or in English: Daily Bread) (We all need our social interactions and touches on the feeding bit again)
* +1 {{ana-r}} yes to renaming - ideas:
** Freewheel (I was chatting with a friend and I looked up "independent" on thesaurus and "freewheeling" was there which sounds a bit odd but we thought that "freewheel" doesn't sound too bad?)
* +0 {{realize.be}} I don't have strong feelings about the name. I just adopted it because it kind of felt good to have a consistent name for an IndieWeb reader across all platforms. No ideas for the name either. Note: I'm thinking to search for a new maintainer (for all platforms actually), so if anyone feels up for the task, give me a shout! '''Note''': updated the +1 to a more neutral one. I'm also non native English and I never had any problems with it. I also originally thought that the first part ('Indi') was referring to IndieWeb in general :) I agree with Peter that, in case a new name is chosen, it should be very unique.
* +0 from non native English speaker perspective, the meaning of the word is OK - but for some reason, it's stupidly hard to remember the correct spelling. The benefit, however, is that it's unique. Please keep it that way, so searching for the app doesn't show anything else that it could be mistaken for.
