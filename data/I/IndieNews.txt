'''<dfn>[https://news.indieweb.org/ IndieNews]</dfn>''' is an indieweb-specific news aggregator which only accepts submissions via [[webmention]], and is for syndicating posts relevant to the indieweb.

What’s <span id="indieweb_relevant">relevant to the indieweb<span>? Lots of things! The guidance here has a number of good examples:
* '''[[relevant to the IndieWeb wiki]]'''

Is IndieNews for syndicating any article posted to an indieweb site?
* No, we have '''[[stream.indieweb.org]]''' for that purpose.

== How to use IndieNews ==
* [https://news.indieweb.org/how-to-submit-a-post submit a post] - post something on your own site and send [[webmention]] 
* Bookmark a post - To submit someone else's post, you can post a [[bookmark]] on your site and submit that URL to IndieNews! Post an <code>h-entry</code> as normal, and include a <code>u-bookmark-of</code> property linking to the actual URL you want to submit.
<!-- commenting is disabled for now
* [http://news.indiewebcamp.com/how-to-comment comment on a post] - post a comment on your own site [[in-reply-to]] the original post, with a syndication URL to the IndieNews post.
-->

Submissions to IndieNews are included in the [[this-week]] newsletter, which is one of the reasons it’s preferred that submissions are relevant to the indieweb.
