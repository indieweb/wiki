'''<dfn>Indieweb for Education</dfn>''' is the application of indieweb [[principles]] to one's personal site with a particular emphasis on use cases for education, pedagogy, research, [[academic samizdat]], and collaboration. 

While the general [[principles]] of indieweb can apply to anyone's site, in an attempt to help foster the next [[generations|generation]] of potential IndieWeb adopters who may be focused on teaching, education, and research, whether at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, post-doc, or other levels, we're compiling some specific hints, tips, pointers, and examples which may be germane to these particular audiences to assist in their motivation and adoption.

In addition to the material below, be sure to see [[getting started]], which is an excellent place to start for all people. For additional help and discussion, feel free to visit the [[discuss|IndieWeb chat rooms]].

== Projects ==
Naturally any [[project]] could be used for educational or research purposes, but the following either are geared toward the academic/research spaces, or are heavily used by them and have a relatively rich ecosystem of additional functionality or plugins to expand their use specifically toward these areas. New users, particularly those of [[generations]] 2+ who may not be programmers/developers by nature may be advised to take a look at one or more of these for their base functionality.

=== Known ===
{{main|Known}}

The [[Known]] CMS was built as an opensource Indieweb project from the ground up, but the business side of the project is geared toward the education market, thus making it a convenient choice, particularly for classroom and collaborative use. [https://withknown.com/education/ Known's education specific page] has some great motivation for using indieweb in learning and research environments.

=== Drupal ===
{{main|Drupal}}

In addition to the standard Drupal core set up which can be extended with modules for additional functionality, there is also the [[Open Scholar]] project which is geared toward use by professors as well as reasearch groups, departments, and even entire universities.

=== Domain of One's Own ===
{{main|A Domain of One%27s Own}}

[[A Domain of One%27s Own]] (or DoOO) is a project at University of Mary Washington that allows students, faculty, and staff to register their own domain name and associate it with a hosted web space, free of charge. With their Domain and corresponding web space, users will have the opportunity and flexibility to design and create a meaningful and vibrant digital presence.

* [https://github.com/readywriting/dooocurriculum Flexible Modules for helping to incorporate Domain of One's Own into the curriculum.]
* For those interested a [https://workshop.reclaimhosting.com/ Workshop of One's Own] is scheduled for 2018-03-15 to 2018-03-16 

=== Grav ===
{{main|Grav}}

[[Grav]] is a flat-file [[CMS]] built on PHP, with Twig templating, and YAML + Markdown for storing articles (YAML for metadata, Markdown for the content).

Paul Hibbitts has some Grav related [http://learn.hibbittsdesign.org/ resources available] with regard to education.

=== MLA Commons ===
[https://mla.hcommons.org/ MLA Commons] is a scholarly network for MLA members. Users can discover the latest open-access scholarship and teaching materials, join language and literature discussion groups, build a WordPress Web site for a class or conferenceâ€”or to showcase your own workâ€”and grow your readership by uploading materials to CORE, our open-access repository. This is a growing "open" network in academia that allows for [[generations|Gen2+]] users an easy way to create websites (particularly [[WordPress]] based sites), generally for academic purposes. 
* Its flexibility compared to self-hosted WordPress may be limited, but it could be a simple way to join a larger network of academics for additional work related functionality. 
* An inexpensive MLA Membership is required for full functionality on the platform. Compared to domain registration and hosting, the cost becomes a net positive when bundled with their other services.
* Set up is fairly similar to WordPress.com or EduBlogs in terms of site flexibility, though it does provide interaction with a large network of other academics.
* No support for [[webmentions]] (yet)
* Not all themes properly support [[microformats]]

=== ScholarlyHub ===
[https://www.scholarlyhub.org/ ScholarlyHub] intends to be a paid platform to allow people, especially teachers and researchers, to own their own content and data and share it freely. While not specifically identifying as IndieWeb, many of their [https://www.scholarlyhub.org/faqs/ core philosophies] are very IndieWeb-centric. In early 2018, they are attempting to raise â‚¬500,000 by 2018-31-07 to build what looks like a [[generation|Gen2+]] platform.

<blockquote>Your donation will help launch a new scholarly social network which is entirely non-profit, member-run and open access. ScholarlyHub will not trade in users' data, will protect scholarsâ€™ independence from conglomerate publishersâ€™ market-oriented needs, and will make scholarship visible and accessible across disciplines and throughout the world.</blockquote>

=== Science Sites ===
[http://www.sciencesites.org Science Sites, Inc.] is a Massachusetts 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization which was founded and directed by science writers to bring a journalistic approach to content strategy and website creation. Their goal is to "help scientists and scientific organizations engage with new media and best showcase and share their work online."
 
They believe that:
<blockquote>"Too many brilliant researchers with too much important research have no acceptable web presence. We believe that improving how their work is represented online will bring greater attention to their research and advance the public's appreciation and understanding of science."</blockquote>
* Websites appear to be based on the [[SquareSpace]] platform
* They provide hosting and maintenance and do charge for building sites for clients apparently in the $1K+ budget range
* Their target market is for [[generations|Gen2+]] people.

=== Scalar ===
{{main|Scalar}}

'''<dfn>[https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/ Scalar]</dfn>''' is a free, open source authoring and publishing platform thatâ€™s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online.

* [http://stuartgeiger.com/ Stuart Geiger] has a [https://academicpages.github.io/ ready-to-fork GitHub pages template] that supports [[resum%C3%A9|CV-style]] content which is geared toward academics. Pull requests are welcome.
<blockquote>Academics who need a personal website, check out my http://academicpages.github.io  project, a ready-to-fork GitHub pages template supporting CV-style content. Difficulty is more than using Wordpress but lower than building your own site from scratch. Over 2,500 people have tried it out!</blockquote> --[https://twitter.com/staeiou/status/1052596352981422080 Stuart Geiger via Twitter]
