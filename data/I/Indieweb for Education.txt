'''<dfn>Indieweb for Education</dfn>''' is the application of indieweb [[principles]] to one's personal site with a particular emphasis on use cases for education, pedagogy, research, [[academic samizdat]], and collaboration. 

While the general [[principles]] of indieweb can apply to anyone's site, in an attempt to help foster the next [[generations|generation]] of potential IndieWeb adopters who may be focused on teaching, education, and research, whether at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, post-doc, or other levels, we're compiling some specific hints, tips, pointers, and examples which may be germane to these particular audiences to assist in their motivation and adoption.

In addition to the material below, be sure to see [[getting started]], which is an excellent place to start for all people.


== Projects ==
Naturally any [[project]] could be used for educational or research purposes, but the following either are geared toward the academic/research spaces, or are heavily used by them and have a relatively rich ecosystem of additional functionality or plugins to expand their use specifically toward these areas. New users, particularly those of [[generations]] 2+ who may not be programmers/developers by nature may be advised to take a look at one or more of these for their base functionality.

=== Known ===
{{main|Known}}

The [[Known]] CMS was built as an opensource Indieweb project from the ground up, but the business side of the project is geared toward the education market, thus making it a convenient choice, particularly for classroom and collaborative use.
