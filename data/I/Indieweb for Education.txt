'''<dfn>Indieweb for Education</dfn>''' is the application of indieweb [[principles]] to one's personal site with a particular emphasis on [[use case|use cases]] for education, pedagogy, research, [[academic samizdat]], and collaboration. 

While the general [[principles]] of indieweb can apply to anyone's site, in an attempt to help foster the next [[generations|generation]] of potential IndieWeb adopters who may be focused on teaching, education, and research, whether at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, post-doc, or other levels, we're compiling some specific hints, tips, pointers, and examples which may be germane to these particular audiences to assist in their motivation and adoption.

In addition to the material below, be sure to see [[getting started]], which is an excellent place to start for all people. For additional help and discussion, feel free to visit the [[discuss|IndieWeb chat rooms]].

=== Domain of One's Own ===
{{main|A Domain of One%27s Own}}

[[A Domain of One%27s Own]] (or DoOO) is a project at University of Mary Washington that allows students, faculty, and staff to register their own domain name and associate it with a hosted web space, free of charge. With their Domain and corresponding web space, users will have the opportunity and flexibility to design and create a meaningful and vibrant digital presence.

=== Grav ===
{{main|Grav}}

[[Grav]] is a flat-file [[CMS]] built on PHP, with Twig templating, and YAML + Markdown for storing articles (YAML for metadata, Markdown for the content).

Paul Hibbitts has some Grav related [http://learn.hibbittsdesign.org/ resources available] with regard to education.

=== MLA Commons ===
[https://mla.hcommons.org/ MLA Commons] is a scholarly network for MLA members. Users can discover the latest open-access scholarship and teaching materials, join language and literature discussion groups, build a WordPress Web site for a class or conferenceâ€”or to showcase your own workâ€”and grow your readership by uploading materials to CORE, our open-access repository. This is a growing "open" network in academia that allows for [[generations|Gen2+]] users an easy way to create websites (particularly [[WordPress]] based sites), generally for academic purposes. 
* Its flexibility compared to self-hosted WordPress may be limited, but it could be a simple way to join a larger network of academics for additional work related functionality. 
* An inexpensive MLA Membership is required for full functionality on the platform. Compared to domain registration and hosting, the cost becomes a net positive when bundled with their other services.
* Set up is fairly similar to WordPress.com or EduBlogs in terms of site flexibility, though it does provide interaction with a large network of other academics.
* No support for [[webmentions]] (yet)
* Not all themes properly support [[microformats]]

=== ScholarlyHub ===
[https://www.scholarlyhub.org/ ScholarlyHub] intends to be a paid platform to allow people, especially teachers and researchers, to own their own content and data and share it freely. While not specifically identifying as IndieWeb, many of their [https://www.scholarlyhub.org/faqs/ core philosophies] are very IndieWeb-centric. In early 2018, they are attempting to raise â‚¬500,000 by 2018-31-07 to build what looks like a [[generation|Gen2+]] platform.

<blockquote>Your donation will help launch a new scholarly social network which is entirely non-profit, member-run and open access. ScholarlyHub will not trade in users' data, will protect scholarsâ€™ independence from conglomerate publishersâ€™ market-oriented needs, and will make scholarship visible and accessible across disciplines and throughout the world.</blockquote>

=== Science Sites ===
[http://www.sciencesites.org Science Sites, Inc.] is a Massachusetts 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization which was founded and directed by science writers to bring a journalistic approach to content strategy and website creation. Their goal is to "help scientists and scientific organizations engage with new media and best showcase and share their work online."
 
They believe that:
<blockquote>"Too many brilliant researchers with too much important research have no acceptable web presence. We believe that improving how their work is represented online will bring greater attention to their research and advance the public's appreciation and understanding of science."</blockquote>
* Websites appear to be based on the [[SquareSpace]] platform
* They provide hosting and maintenance and do charge for building sites for clients apparently in the $1K+ budget range
* Their target market is for [[generations|Gen2+]] people.

=== Scalar ===
{{main|Scalar}}

'''<dfn>[https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/ Scalar]</dfn>''' is a free, open source authoring and publishing platform thatâ€™s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online.

<blockquote>Library Carpentry develops lessons and teaches workshops for and with people working in library- and information-related roles. Our goal is to create an on-ramp to empower this community to use software and data in their own work as well as be advocates for and train others in efficient, effective and reproducible data and software practices. Our workshops are based on [https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/ our lessons]. Workshop hosts, Instructors, and learners must be prepared to follow [http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html The Carpentries Code of Conduct].</blockquote>


=== Static Site Generators ===
==== GitHub pages ====
{{main|github-pages}}
* [http://stuartgeiger.com/ Stuart Geiger] has a [https://academicpages.github.io/ ready-to-fork GitHub pages template] that supports [[resum%C3%A9|CV-style]] content which is geared toward academics. Pull requests are welcome.
<blockquote>Academics who need a personal website, check out my http://academicpages.github.io  project, a ready-to-fork GitHub pages template supporting CV-style content.

=== Aggregation ===
{{main|planet}}
Aggregating class-wide related work can be a common stumbling block for some teachers, designers, and technologists. Below is a short list of potential technologies geared toward solving this problem
==== FeedWordPress ====
[http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/ FeedWordPress] is an open-source Atom/RSS aggregator for the WordPress blog publishing platform with planet-like functionality. Taylor Jadin has [https://twitter.com/TaylorJadin/status/1058197530108923906 set it up for this functionality in the past].

==== PressForward ====
[[PressForward]] is free software built for [[WordPress]] for curating and sharing content from the web. While originally developed for journalists curating content, its core functionality adds a native RSS feed reader into one's site. It could be used as a [[planet]] in online course related settings.

==== gRSShopper ====
[[gRSShopper]] is a personal web environment that combines resource aggregation, a personal dataspace, and personal publishing. It's a project built by {{Downes}}.

==== Known ====
[[Known]] can be set up for an entire class with multi-user accounts. Better, it can be set up with syndication capabilities that allows users to use their own sites to post material and syndicate it into the shared class-based site. {{chrisaldrich}} has set up something like this in the past.

==== Syndication via Webmention ====
While different than most of the above models, perhaps the [[Reddit]] like functionality of sites like [https://news.indieweb.org news.indieweb.org] or [[Indieweb.xyz]] could be leveraged to allow students to post their content on their own websites and purposefully syndicate class-related pieces into a commons using [[Webmention]]. Having the ability to delete the content from the planet at a later date by editing or deleting the Webmention could be a beneficial piece of functionality.

==== Blogs as Notebook/Portfolios ====
Educators have always used blogs for electronic [https://catlintucker.com/2016/11/trading-in-traditional-notebooks-for-multimedia-blogs/ notebooks] and student portfolios. This practice is most prevalent on [[Blogger]], but [[edublogs]], kidblogs, and SeeSaw among others are also used.
