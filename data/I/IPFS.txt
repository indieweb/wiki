'''<dfn>[https://ipfs.io IPFS]</dfn>''' is short for <dfn>InterPlanetary File System</dfn>, potentially a [[static site]] storage method using content based addressing.

IPFS is self-described as “a new hypermedia distribution protocol”.

== Events ==
There have been [http://calagator.org/events/tag/ipfs some IPFS meetups] in Portland, Oregon starting in July 2015.

== Selfdogfooding ==
* '''https://ipfs.io/''' website itself is all stored in IPFS and hosted using an IPFS gateway. For example you can also see the site at any other public gateway, such as here: http://dweb.link/ipns/ipfs.io/
* '''http://juan.benet.ai/''' (founder Juan Benet’s site) is a static site that says it "It runs on IPFS." ([[selfdogfooding]]) as of [https://web.archive.org/web/20190307084946/http://juan.benet.ai/ 2019-03-07] (previously had no mention as of [https://web.archive.org/web/20190228082927/http://juan.benet.ai/ 2019-02-28]; site appeared unchanged since 2014).

== Implementations ==
Marcus Povey has an experimental plugin with IPFS support for [[Known]].

=== Who ===
There are no human names on its website (https://ipfs.io), except the title of a video has Juan Benet as a presenter, whose website appears to be http://juan.benet.ai/.
* As of 2019 the https://ipfs.io/team/ page has a number of other people as working group Captains.

When installing a full node, this will allow Brave users to load content over IPFS’ p2p network, hosted on their own node.  Integrating IPFS provides Brave users with a significantly enhanced browsing experience, increasing the availability of content, offloading server costs from the content publisher, and improving the overall resilience of the Internet.<br>Molly Mackinlay, Project Lead at IPFS said, “Bringing the benefits of the dWeb to Brave users, IPFS’ efforts to remove systemic data censorship by corporations and nation-states are now strengthened through the integration with Brave. Today, Web users across the world are unable to access restricted content, including, for example, parts of Wikipedia in Thailand, over 100,000 blocked websites in Turkey, and critical access to COVID-19 information in China. Now anyone with an internet connection can access this critical information through IPFS on the Brave browser.”<br>In a further aspect of the integration, projects building on IPFS such as app development platforms, Textile, and Fleek, will automatically enable anyone to deploy a website or dApp accessible on Brave.<br>Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave, said, “We’re thrilled to be the first browser to offer a native IPFS integration with today’s Brave desktop browser release. Providing Brave’s 1 million+ verified content creators with the power to seamlessly serve content to millions of new users across the globe via a new and secure protocol, IPFS gives users a solution to the problem of centralized servers creating a central point of failure for content access. IPFS’ innovative content addressing uses Content Identifiers (CIDs) to form an address based on the content itself as opposed to locating data based on the address of a server. Integrating the IPFS open-source network is a key milestone in making the Web more transparent, decentralized, and resilient.” <br>With a budding community of over four thousand IPFS contributors around the world, this is the initial implementation of IPFS on Brave. Striving to give users full control of their online experience, future collaborations will facilitate automatic redirects from DNSLink websites to the native IPFS version, the ability to “co-host” a website, features to easily publish to IPFS, and much more.<br>###<br>Molly Mackinlay, Project Lead at IPFS, and Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave, are available for interview<br>About IPFS<br>IPFS is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS upgrades the web to work peer to peer, addressing data by what it is instead of where it’s located on the network, or who is hosting it.<br>About Brave<br>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users get a private, speedier web experience with much longer battery life, publishers increase their revenue share, and advertisers achieve better conversion. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators. The Brave solution is a win-win for everyone who has a stake in the open Web and who is weary of giving up privacy and revenue to the ad-tech intermediaries. Brave currently has over 24 million monthly active users and over 1 million Verified Publishers. Brave Software was co-founded by Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla (Firefox), and Brian Bondy, formerly of Khan Academy and Mozilla.<br>For more information, visit https://brave.com/ or follow the company on Twitter @brave.<br><br>			 <br>				<br>				<br>				<br>			 <br>			 <br>				<br>				<br>			 <br>				<br>				<br>			 <br>				<br>				<br>				<br>				<br>					<br>				<br>				<br>				<br>				<br><br>				<br>				<br>				<br>Related Articles<br>Continue reading for news on ad blocking, features, performance, privacy and Basic Attention Token related announcements.<br><br>			 <br>			 <br>				<br>				<br>			 <br>				<br>				<br>				<br>				<br>					<br>					<br>					<br>					<br>						<br>			 <br>												IPFS Support in Brave<br>				<br>				<br><br>Over the past several months, the Brave team has been working with Protocol Labs on adding InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) support in Brave.
