'''<dfn>[https://ipfs.io IPFS]</dfn>''' is short for <dfn>InterPlanetary File System</dfn>, potentially a [[static site]] storage method using content based addressing.

IPFS is self-described as “a new hypermedia distribution protocol”.

== Events ==
There have been [http://calagator.org/events/tag/ipfs some IPFS meetups] in Portland, Oregon starting in July 2015.

== Selfdogfooding ==
* '''https://ipfs.io/''' website itself is all stored in IPFS and hosted using an IPFS gateway. For example you can also see the site at any other public gateway, such as here: http://dweb.link/ipns/ipfs.io/
* '''http://juan.benet.ai/''' (founder Juan Benet’s site) is a static site that says it "It runs on IPFS." ([[selfdogfooding]]) as of [https://web.archive.org/web/20190307084946/http://juan.benet.ai/ 2019-03-07] (previously had no mention as of [https://web.archive.org/web/20190228082927/http://juan.benet.ai/ 2019-02-28]; site appeared unchanged since 2014).

== Implementations ==
Marcus Povey has an experimental plugin with IPFS support for [[Known]].

== Issues ==
=== Who ===
There are no human names on its website (https://ipfs.io), except the title of a video has Juan Benet as a presenter, whose website appears to be http://juan.benet.ai/.
* As of 2019 the https://ipfs.io/team/ page has a number of other people as working group Captains.

=== Interplanetary ===
Apparently unrelated to NASA’s actual Interplanetary [[Solar System Internet]] (SSI) being built on their [https://www.nasa.gov/content/dtn Disruption Tolerant Networking]
