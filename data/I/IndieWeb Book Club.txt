'''<dfn>IndieWeb book club</dfn>''' is a group of people interested in creating book club functionality a reality in their online presences.

Alternately, it could be an actual group of IndieWeb adherents actually reading ([[Books about the IndieWeb|IndieWeb related?]]) [[book|books]] together and discussing them.

Participants are encouraged to write and post publicly about the book on their own websites and syndicate their participation to https://indieweb.xyz/en/bookclub/ as an organizing hub for the conversation.


== Brainstorming ==
* {{chrisaldrich}}: Could build a parser to take a [[collection]] of people and scan their want-to-read lists/posts to surface common books to aid in choosing the next book.
* {{t}}: Creating a leaderboard of books to-read
