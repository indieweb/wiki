[[Category:Challenge]]

'''<dfn>IndieWeb Book Club</dfn>''' is a monthly book themed [[blog carnival]] inspired by the [[indieweb-carnival]] started in October 2025.

== Why ==
IndieWeb carnivals help motivate people to post more on their personal websites. 

And for all reasons why described in:
* '''[[why post|why post?]]''' 
* '''[[IndieWeb Carnival]]'''

== Who ==

''Anyone'' with a website is eligible to host and welcome to participate! 

=== How To Host ===

Each month, IndieWeb Book Club has a different host. 

At the month's beginning, as host, create an announcement [[post]] talking about your book. Add that to the table of [[#Books_&_Hosts|books and hosts]]. Hosts add to that post as entries come in by webmention, email, or comment. At the month’s end, the host collects the received submissions and posts an overview of it at a new url and/or update the original announcement. 

To commit to hosting, sign up below!

=== How To Participate ===

Read the book! Post your review, thoughts, opinions or even a small [[read]] post and notify the host.

== Current Rules (Can Change) ==

The rules are aligned with the rules for [[indieweb-carnival]] with a few tweaks.

=== For Host ===

At the month’s beginning, the host posts their chosen book as a post on their site. The host collects the submissions until the end of the month. After that, the host posts the summary of all interactions including links and sends them to the next month's host post.

The main way of people submitting are webmentions and email.

Ideally, when selecting a book, avoid ones that lean too heavily into something that may cause unease, or a genre that only interests a niche audience. The book should also be written in English, but it can be a translation.

Also, please submit a book you haven't written/contributed to.

==== Ideas For Book Selection ====

* Fiction or non-fiction, whichever appeals!
* One that discusses art, design, or history
* A topic that relates to the theme of 'indie'
* A book you've been wanting to read for a while

=== Rules For Participants ===

Once you’ve read the book, post something about it on your blog, like a simple read post or a review. The post should be written in the month the book club takes place. 

Then, submit your submission to the host via webmention or email. 

== History ==

Started in its current iteration by {{zachary.kai}}.

=== Current Notes & Ideas ===

* {{zachary.kai}} has compiled [https://roadlessread.com/lists/iwbc the list of selected books and interviews] with hosts on his book blog.

=== Previous Notes & Ideas ===

'''<dfn>IndieWeb book club</dfn>''' is a group of people interested in creating book club functionality a reality in their online presences. Alternately, it could be an actual group of IndieWeb adherents actually reading ([[Books about the IndieWeb|IndieWeb related?]]) [[book|books]] together and discussing them.

* 2019-05-04 {{chrisaldrich}} posted on his own website [https://boffosocko.com/2019/05/04/indieweb-book-club-ruined-by-design/ proposing a book club for Mike Monteiro's book Ruined by Design]. Participants are encouraged to write and post publicly about the book on their own websites and syndicate their participation to https://indieweb.xyz/en/bookclub/ as an organizing hub for the conversation.
* {{chrisaldrich}}: Could build a parser to take a [[collection]] of people and scan their want-to-read lists/posts to surface common books to aid in choosing the next book.
* {{t}}: Creating a leaderboard of books to-read
