    '''<dfn>ICANN</dfn>''' is a global organization that is responsible for running the [[Domain Name]] Service root name servers and is also responsible for the assignment of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

The rules and administration of TLDs is a secondary priority but also one that is it's primary revenue generator which some consider a source of conflict.

It is also responsible for the sending of emails when domain contact information changes which can be a problem as documented in https://levels.io/icann-mafia/.
