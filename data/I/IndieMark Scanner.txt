https://indieweb.org/IndieMark_Scanner

'''<dfn>IndieMark Scanner</dfn>''' was a project started by {{JackyAlcine}} to give IndieWeb participants a way to determine exactly where they fall on the scale of marks. It's like https://indiewebify.me/ but more automated. As of April 2022, more discussions around IndieMark has come up and I've {{jacky}} put this project on hold.
