'''<dfn>IndieSilo</dfn>''' is a website (typically a web based [[micropub]] client) that stores data on behalf of people who may not have their own website yet, but who may want to be able to store it now and [[import]] it to their site at a later date.

By saving and displaying the data, these sites can also serve as a means of [[discovery]] mechanism for finding other interesting people to [[follow]].
