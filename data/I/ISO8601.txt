'''<dfn>ISO8601</dfn>''' is an international standard for dates and times roughly in the form <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</code>, or with timezone offset, <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000</code>.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{t}} (currently) explicitly stores only the standard ISO <code>HH:MM</code> "create time" (without date) of his posts in his posts in [[bim]] storage files, since the date of the post is encoded partially in its permalink as <code>DDD</code> (ISO 8601 ordinal day, i.e. nth day of the year), and the year of the post is the name of the parent directory of the storage file.
** See '''[[Falcon#Storage_format]]''' for more details.
