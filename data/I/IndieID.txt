'''<dfn>IndieID</dfn>''' is an opne source IndieAuth service and an alternative to [[indieauth.com]] found at [https://indieid.com indieid.com]

== Motivation ==
Many people rely solely on [[indieauth.com]] as their auth endpoint, and while it is open source, it is ruby on rails and a little more difficult to run your own instance.  IndieID is written in PHP, uses no database, and tries to keep required libraries to a minimum in hopes that anyone can run their own IndieAuth server. ~{{benthatmustbeme}}
