The '''<dfn>Internet Movie Database</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>IMDb</dfn>''' is a large film and television database and [[silo]] that allows for rating content, [[read|reading]] and writing [[review|reviews]], creating [[want|watchlists]], and adding [[watch|media checkins]] among other functionalities.

== Export Data ==
IMDb previously had [[RSS]] feeds for portions of personal data including lists and what they call checkins (see instead [[watch|watches]]), but no longer supports that functionality (though as of 2020-01-16 their [https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/social/check-ins-faq/GG59ELYW45FMC7J3?ref_=helpart_brdc_dropdown# help page indicates that they do]).

Most pieces of functionality on the site that pertain to one's personal data has an "export this list" link at the bottom right of those pages to allow one to export their data as a .csv file.

As of 2020-01-16 IMDb doesn't seem to have functionality for exporting [[review]]s.

[[Letterboxd]], a competing silo, has a good page that outlines how to export your ratings, checkins, watchlist, and lists from IMDb.com (as well as the ability to upload it to their site in a [[S2S|silo-to-silo]] syndication fashion.
