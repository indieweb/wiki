International Standard Serial Number ('''<dfn>ISSN</dfn>''') is an identification number for periodicals that at least two IndieWeb community members have on their websites. ISSNs are controlled by the member countries of the [https://www.issn.org/ ISSN International Centre].

== How To ==

[https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing Google Scholar recommends] using a meta element with the name <code>citation_issn</code>. For example:

<pre><meta name="citation_issn" content="1234-5678"></pre>

It is also available as [https://schema.org/issn Schema.org metadata] for inclusion in either microdata or JSON-LD.

'''Most IndieWeb sites are ineligible for ISSN assignment.''' 

"Ongoing integrating resources" (such as part of a website) must meet [https://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/assignment-rules/the-issn-for-electronic-media/ specific criteria] such as having a consistent URL, a clear publisher, and a consistent publication Title. Personal websites/online diaries, link-only sites, and company websites are specifically excluded though blogs that do not fall into those categories may be allowed.

* 2003-09-24 Zeldman: [https://www.zeldman.com/daily/0903b.shtml#se2403 Must-link-to: ISSN and weblogs] <blockquote>Many independent web periodicals, including the one you’re reading, have long held an ISSN number (ours is 1534-0309). Once you obtain such a number, your publication officially exists in a standardized encyclopedia of periodicals maintained by the world’s librarians.</blockquote>

=== Terence Eden ===
{{edent}} has an ISSN in his website footer and as a meta element: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/ since 2021-09-17.
