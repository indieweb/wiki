Jeffrey Zeldman has an ISSN on his website about page https://www.zeldman.com/about/, since at least 2003-09-24:
* 2003-09-24 Zeldman: [https://www.zeldman.com/daily/0903b.shtml#se2403 Must-link-to: ISSN and weblogs] <blockquote>Many independent web periodicals, including the one you’re reading, have long held an ISSN number (ours is 1534-0309). Once you obtain such a number, your publication officially exists in a standardized encyclopedia of periodicals maintained by the world’s librarians.</blockquote>
