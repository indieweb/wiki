International Standard Serial Number ('''<dfn>ISSN</dfn>''') is an identification number for periodicals that at least two IndieWeb community members have on their websites. ISSNs are controlled by the member countries of the [https://www.issn.org/ ISSN International Centre].

== How To ==

'''Most IndieWeb sites are ineligible for ISSN assignment.''' "Ongoing integrating resources" (such as part of a website) must meet [https://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/assignment-rules/the-issn-for-electronic-media/ specific criteria] such as having a consistent URL, a clear publisher, and a consistent publication Title. Personal websites/online diaries, link-only sites, and company websites are specifically excluded though blogs that do not fall into those categories may be allowed.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Jeffrey Zeldman ===
Jeffrey Zeldman has an ISSN on his website about page https://www.zeldman.com/about/, since at least 2003-09-24:
* 2003-09-24 Zeldman: [https://www.zeldman.com/daily/0903b.shtml#se2403 Must-link-to: ISSN and weblogs] <blockquote>Many independent web periodicals, including the one you’re reading, have long held an ISSN number (ours is 1534-0309). Once you obtain such a number, your publication officially exists in a standardized encyclopedia of periodicals maintained by the world’s librarians.</blockquote>
