'''<dfn>IndieWeb Summit</dfn>''' is a regular, usually annual, gathering of the IndieWeb community, similar to an IndieWebCamp though with space for more participants, many of whom travel a large distance, with more structure such as keynotes, and typically one or more local events in the week before leading up to the main two-day event, usually in [[Portland]] (2011-2019).
