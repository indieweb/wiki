'''<dfn>Introduction</dfn>''' is the first session at an [[IndieWebCamp]], where organizers go over the basic structure of the camp, [[code of conduct]], [[photo policy]], logistics and may play one or more IndieWeb-relevant inspiring videos or give brief introductions to IndieWeb [[principles]] and how to get the most out of the camp.
