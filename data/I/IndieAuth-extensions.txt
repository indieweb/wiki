'''<dfn>IndieAuth extensions</dfn>''' are [[IndieAuth]] extensions that are proposed, prototyped, or implemented beyond the official [https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org IndieAuth specification].

== Why ==

IndieAuth is itself an OAuth2.0 extension, but it requires and incorporates several OAuth 2.0 extensions as part of the specification. OAuth 2.0 has a variety of proposed extensions itself that technically can be implemented as part of an implementation of IndieAuth.

IndieAuth has incorporated OAuth2.0 extensions into the specification, such as [[PKCE]].

This page is for documenting such extensions to [[IndieAuth]] or for documenting OAuth2.0 extensions that have been implemented on IndieAuth endpoints and the considerations/modifications required to do so. These would be extensions that are not proposed as additions to the specification itself.

== How to ==
Please use this page to document the list of current and proposed extensions, as well as document implementations of them. Development and discussion of the extensions should happen in a GitHub issue in the IndieAuth repo. 

=== How to propose an extension ===

Please open a new issue [https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues here] tagged with the extensions label if you would like to propose a new extension, then you can add a new section below to document your implementation of it here.

== Stable Extensions ==

A stable extension is when a proposed extension has gotten multiple implementations from various people and/or organizations and is considered complete in functionality. This ensures that the extension works for a variety of use-cases and not just for a single project or company. 

There are no stable extensions at this time.

== Proposed Extensions == 

Anyone can create a '''proposed''' extension. A proposed extension should have an issue [https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues in the IndieAuth repository] tagged with the extension label and a stub under this section.

Extensions may be given labels of their own under the repository as they develop.

=== Ticketing ===

The Ticketing extension for IndieAuth is detailed under [[Ticketing_for_IndieAuth]] and describes a flow that enables a publisher to send authorization, known as a ticket, that can be redeemed for an access token. This allows both solicited and unsolicited invitations to fetch restricted resources.
