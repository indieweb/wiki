The '''<dfn>IndieWeb Awards</dfn>''' are honors bestowed by the active IndieWeb community for a variety of categories in an effort to both highlight and celebrate the past year's accomplishments.

A proposal....

== Reasons ==
* We're a big enough/growing community that we should celebrate both our collective and individual accomplishments
* Could highlight new tools, projects, and features for current and new members
* Acts as a potential outreach/public relations tool
* Encourages people to keep improving/working on their sites
* Encourages lapsed members to come back and participate
* Finally a page with a trophy emojicon!
* ''It is'' awards season after all.
* [[fun]], [[fun]], and more [[fun]]
* ...
__TOC__

== Brainstorming ==
=== General Thoughts ===
* Potentially to be awarded at [[2018/Baltimore]] or [[2018|IndieWeb Summit 2018]]
* Almost anything can be nominated/voted upon, but the criteria (for most categories) is that they should have happened in the 2017 calendar year
* People can't vote for their own creations or situations which would be generally deemed a direct conflict of interest (please no gaming)
* Categories
* Design [[badges]] that winners could display
* Creates pride of ownership
* Encourages growth
* A chance to be positive

=== Voting ===
* Choose a voting system/method?
** Possibly use open wiki voting structure (this may be a bit unwieldy)
** Closed/Anonymous balloting system?
** Voting by webmention somewhere? (requirement for webmentions may exclude some voters)
* Nominations period followed by a voting period
** Determine dates/times
* One vote per category
* Voter eligibility criteria?
** User page on wiki? (Higher or lower bar?) 

=== Sponsorship ===
* Webhosts or other related companies could sponsor the awards
** Potential give-aways meant to encourage site ownership and creation? Hosting packages, domain registrations, etc.
** Funds to support community building, diversity and inclusion initiatives, the travel fund, etc.
** Books or paid resources to help new members build and maintain their sites
