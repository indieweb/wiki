How to organize an IndieWebCamp.

Consider first organizing a [[Homebrew_Website_Club#Structure|Homebrew Website Club meetup]]

= Before =
To organize an IndieWebCamp, you need:
# '''2-4 organizers''' - in practice that's worked best. 
#* only 1 organizer means more chance things get dropped on the floor
#* having co-organizers helps keep mutual motivation going, everyone encourages everyone else
#* 2 is the minimum viable: 1 for physical venue stuffs, 1 for virtual stuffs is a good split to start
#* 4 is what [[2011]] had
#* More than 4 hasn't happened in practice.
# '''Add to [[Planning]]''' even if you just want to start the idea, add it to [[Planning]]
# '''Simple wiki page''' with the year and city. Start with just minimal notes and questions, e.g. see the [http://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?title=2014/NYC&oldid=5527 first version of 2014/NYC].
## If your event is multiple days, have notations for what portion people will attend for.
# '''Divide up key organizing''' responsibilities (venue, sponsors, food, tables/chairs, volunteers)
# '''Venue''' with network access (donated / sponsored)
# '''Sponsors''', either dedicated (see recent IndieWebCamps for an explicit list) or via [[open_collective]], for:
#* food
#* travel assistance (see 2016.indieweb.org example)
#* kid related or child care (note available upon request (e.g. [https://www.facebook.com/events/275011629503233/permalink/289758028028593/]), make preparations for all day both days)
# '''Update wiki page''' as more is known, including creating subpages
#* details: Where (address), When (start time, end time)
#* include a subheading '''Participating''' that has links to:
#** [[Code of Conduct]]
#** Session proposals
#** Schedule grid
#** Demos
#** [[Discussion]]
#* event cover image - use a photo of the venue, preferably recognizable (note: please avoid re-using the old 2014 icon/avatar grid)
#* indie event - post / setup an indie [[event]] post for folks to RSVP to
#* ticketing - setup a way to RSVP via a ticketing system like tito or brownpapertickets
#* more event tracking - feel free to also POSSE the event to [[Facebook]] to help folks who use that silo to keep track of the event and invite others
# '''Track venue capacity''', waitlist if necessary
# '''Remind Attendees''', send out some sort of notification/email/text to all attendees and remind them of the event in advance.
#* See [[message-before-iwc]] for message templates to use!

= Packing =
See: '''[[IndieWebCamp kit]]''' for a list of items to consider ordering beforehand

Stuff to bring (doubtful a venue has, thus see [[IndieWebCamp kit]])
# Nametags
# Large Postit notes/papers for scheduling
# Stickers

Stuff to borrow from a venue (and bring if they lack)
# Surge Protectors/Power Strips/Extension Cords - We all need power, and best to make it easy to secure.
# Displayport Adapter
# Markers
# Video streaming kit and microphones.

= During =
When actually doing the IndieWebCamp, you need to at least do:
* venue tables/chairs/projectors/whiteboards/session grid setup
* food/snack/coffee delivery (or bring in)
* pay for expenses via [[open_collective]] (recommended)
* do the [[Introductions]] session
** as part of this show and present the [[code of conduct]], also point out points of contact.
** make sure you have a number of volunteers who are available throughout the event as points of contact and who have [[code_of_conduct#Resolving_an_Issue|listed themselves on that page]] for reference.
* organize sync-up for lunches/dinners/coffee
* take photos
* run the demo session
* set up Session grid with links to [[Etherpad]]s
* direct participants to [[Etherpad#How_to_take_notes_during_IndieWebCamp|How to take notes during IndieWebCamp]]
* organize collaborative cleanup and return venue to a cleaner state than when you showed up

= After =
After (or during if you can keep up)
* upload & post photos on the wiki
* make sure session Etherpads are captured into session notes archives pages on the wiki
* apply information learned from sessions to topical pages on the wiki
