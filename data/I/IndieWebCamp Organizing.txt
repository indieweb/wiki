[[Category:Organizing]]

'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Organizing</dfn>''' is a great way to bring together your local IndieWeb community. It is also quite challenging, requires co-organizers, and key details to succeed that are documented in this page.

If you have never organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] before consider organizing a [[Homebrew_Website_Club#Structure|Homebrew Website Club meetup]] first. It’s a lot less work, and will help you get experience with planning and organizing IndieWeb [[events]]. It’s also a good way to help grow local attendance for a bigger camp.

== What You Will Need ==

=== Organizers ===

To organize an IndieWebCamp, you’ll need '''2-4 organizers'''.

Having only 1 organizer will almost certainly mean things will get missed and the event will likely not happen or have few participants. Organize a [[HWC]] instead.

Co-organizers also help keep mutual motivation going, everyone encourages everyone else.

It can also help to divide up roles:

* At least one '''detail-oriented''' co-organizer. If that's not you, get one. If you lack one, it's unlikely to succeed.
* At least one '''onsite''' co-organizer (or someone who works at the organization hosting the venue).
* One organizer should be exceptionally '''people-friendly''', preferably outgoing and highly emotionally intelligent to handle outreach, getting volunteers (and speakers if any), and coordinating volunteers before and during the event.

Thus 2 is the minimum viable: 1 for physical venue stuff, 1 for detail-oriented virtual stuff. Avoid making that the same person as they may burn out.

[[2011]] had 4 organisers. More than 4 hasn’t happened in practice.

=== Date ===

IndieWebCamps usually (but not always) take place for 2 days, typically over a weekend. 

Locking in dates far in advance will encourage greater attendance, especially for participants that live farther away from venues/cities.

Consider:

* Public holidays: Avoid clashing with public holidays as people may already have plans.
* Adjacent events: IndieWebCamps sometimes coincide with conferences held the week before. Not only can this help increase attendance to the camp, it can also be used as selling point for the conference organiser.

=== Venue ===

An optimal venue for an IndieWebCamp is one with a large space where everyone can gather for introductions and demos, and smaller rooms or breakout areas where participants can hold separate sessions of 5-10 people at a time.

Consider:

* Distance to public transportation
* Ease of access (is there step-free access, lifts, etc.)
* Availability of power (or extension cords)
* Guest WiFi (ask if usernames and passwords are needed)
* Good ventilation (see [[#Health and Safety]])
* Family-friendliness. IndieWebCamps are open to interested parties of all ages, but some venues may have specific rules or restrictions (see [[#Family-friendliness]])

Ask a venue if they have their own code of conduct, community guidelines, security and health and safety policies.

=== Participants ===

You’ll need '''at least 5 participants (at least 4 in-person)''' to have a meaningful IndieWebCamp.

If you cannot get more than 5 people together locally, consider organizing an IndieWebCamp [[Online]] instead, or keep organizing regular [[Homebrew_Website_Club#Structure|Homebrew Website Club meetup]]s until you grow your local community large enough that 5 or more of them will commit to participating in an IndieWebCamp.

IndieWebCamps work best with '''no more than 30 participants'''. Any more means introductions and demos need to be shorter (or the time to accommodate them longer), it can take longer to organize sessions, and more rooms will be needed to host them.

Exception:
* [[IndieWeb Summit]] events typically plan for (and have successfully accommodated) a capacity of 50+, up to 100 in some instances. Summits are planned by experienced IndieWebCamp [[Organizers]] who have organized multiple IndieWebCamps and typically at least a Summit or two, and require additional work beyond what is described here in how to run an IndieWebCamp

A ticketing system is useful to help track event attendance, contact participants before and after the event and help plan ahead for day. See [[#Ticketing]].

== Before ==

All proposals for IndieWebCamps start in [[Planning]]. This can be used to gauge interest, decide on a date and get venue suggestions.

=== Tasks ===

Once you have some organizers, a venue and a date:

# '''Create a wiki page''' with the year and city.
#* Add date and venue details
#* Include any notes and questions
#* See [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=2024/Brighton&oldid=92231 the first version of 2024/Brighton] for an example
# '''Divide up key organizing responsibilities'''. Decide who is co-ordinating with the venue, finding sponsors, arranging food, etc.
#* Add an Organizers section to the wiki page and include roles
#* Include <code><nowiki>{{addyourself}}</nowiki></code> template shortcode so others can indicate roles they can help with
# '''Accessibility'''. Consider both physical and mental disabilities that might prevent or deter individuals from deciding to attend your event.
#* Check your chosen venue has an accessibility statement/section with sufficient details for attendees who may need to know in advance if they can physically access the venue.
#* Summarize and link to accessibility details on the event page.
#* [[2019/Berlin#Accessibility|See Berlin 2019]] for an example.
# '''Get sponsorship''', paid either directly to organizers or via the [[open_collective|IndieWeb Open Collective]]. You can get sponsors for either the entire event or for specific items:
#* Food (breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee/tea)
#* Workshop materials (pens, sticky notes)
#* Travel assistance (see https://2016.indieweb.org example)
# '''Update wiki page''' as more is known.
#* Create an event cover image and/or logo
#* Add a photo of the venue
#* Include start and end times and the schedule for each day
#* '''Participating''' section that has links to:
#** [[Code of Conduct]]
#** Venue code of conduct. For example when events are organized in Mozilla spaces we add both Codes of Conduct to the wiki.
#** [[Discussion]] and attending remotely
#* '''Travel''' section that includes routes to the venue from public transportation
# '''Stub subpages''', categorizing pages by including <code><nowiki>[[Category: IndieWebCamp CITY YEAR]]</nowiki></code>, replacing the city and year:
#* Session proposals
#* Schedule grid
#* Demos
# '''Announce it!''' Once the venue and date are locked down, and there's a decent main wiki page for the event, it’s time to publicise the event.
#* Feel free to also manually POSSE the event to [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]] or other event tracking systems to help folks who use such systems to keep track of the event and invite others.
#* Ideally, publicly announce/broadcast a newly created IndieWebCamp just after a current IndieWebCamp where participants had a great time and are in the mood to look forward to another IndieWebCamp. Folks watching remotely may feel particularly compelled to want to go in person to the next one.
# '''Set-up ticketing'''. Setup a way to RSVP via a ticketing system like [[Tito]] or brownpapertickets.
# '''events.indieweb.org'''. Setup an [[Events|IndieWeb Events]] page for folks to RSVP to and with an area for ticketing
#* Link to the [[Code of Conduct]]
#* Link to the ticketing page
#* Include the [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/indiewebcamp/archive indiewebcamp] tag
#* See '''[https://indieweb.org/Events#How_To_Add_An_Event How To Add An Event]''' for detailed instructions.
# '''Track venue capacity''' and create a waitlist if necessary.

=== Two weeks before ===

==== Organize supplies ====

{{main|IndieWebCamp kit}}

Organize a set of supplies that can be used to run the event. Bring these items to the venue, as it’s unlikely they will supply them:

# Nametags and lanyards
# Large Post-it notes for scheduling
# Stickers
# Pens, markers

Stuff to borrow from a venue (or bring if they lack):
# Surge protectors, power strips or extension cords - We all need power, and best to make it easy to secure.
# Displayport/HDMI adapters
# Video streaming kit and microphones

=== One week before ===

==== Confirm catering ====

If you are catering food for an IndieWebCamp, be sure to arrange and confirm any catering orders before the camp, as close to the camp date as possible so you can provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of folks that will be present.

For [[sustainability]] reasons, [[organizers]] of the past several IndieWebSummits have opted to only sponsor vegetarian food options (with vegan options), we recommend doing the same for your IndieWebCamp.

==== Create signage ====

Create signs you can display at the camp. Useful signs can include:

* Venue directions and/or access instructions
** You can [https://github.com/indieweb/branding/tree/master/signage download an example Sketch file] from Github.
* WiFi access details (network name, password)
* Room names
* Which lanyards to use for photo policy

==== Send a reminder email ====

{{main|message-before-iwc}}

Send out some sort of notification/email/text to all participants to remind them of the event in advance.

=== Family-friendliness ===

{{section-stub}}

IndieWebCamps have not historically provided a specific child program or supervision. Organizers may choose to do this but there are legal concerns which must be considered.

If child care is available upon request (e.g. [https://www.facebook.com/events/275011629503233/permalink/289758028028593/]) include a note on the wiki page and make preparations for all day both days.

=== Health and safety ===
{{section-stub}}
In addition to taking <span id="COVID_precautions">COVID precautions</span>, in-person event organizers should document Health and Safety rules & guidelines in general to help encourage and provide at least some degree of safety at events. This is also an important accessibility consideration to be inclusive of the immunocompromised and disabled.

E.g. if you have any respiratory symptoms, or any symptoms of a cold, flu, RSV, Covid-19, please do not attend in-person.

This section needs to be rewritten to document current practical IndieWebCamp best practices:
* [[2023/SD#Health_and_Safety_Rules|IndieWebCamp San Diego rules]]
* [[2023/Nuremberg#Covid_Rules|IndieWebCamp Nuremberg rules]]

In addition, please review:
* the [https://peoplescdc.org/2022/11/17/safer-in-person-gatherings/ Safer In-person Gatherings Toolkit]
** and consider implementing its precautions to help keep attendees safer. 

In the US, check local sewage & wastewater data as a gauge of virus levels in the area:
* [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance CDC COVID-19: Wastewater Surveillance]
* NYT article: {{citation
| title = As Covid Emergency Ends, Surveillance Shifts to the Sewers
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/health/covid-sewage-wastewater-data.html
| author = [https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-anthes Emily Anthes]
| published = 2023-05-11
| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20230528095051/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/health/covid-sewage-wastewater-data.html
}}

You can also check local county health department sites for case numbers. Previously, the CDC tracked transmission with [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&list_select_county=all_counties&data-type=Risk&null=Risk Community Transmission levels] but unfortunately that stopped with the end of the public health emergency 2023-05-11.

Brainstorming for in-person IWCs:
* fund daily rapid tests for all participants, 
* perhaps IWC branded KN95 masks for folks, complimentary N95 masks as well for all participants

==== Examples ====
Examples of precautions and policies from other organizations and meetings:

TPAC 2023: https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/health.html
* recommends masking in all public places 72 hours before the event
* recommends taking a rapid antigen test before your departure
* recommends masking during your entire travel journey
* requires attendees to wear a mask in all common spaces and meeting rooms
* offers KN95 and N95 masks at event registration
* requires daily COVID rapid antigen test kits and provides the tests to attendees
* encourages notifying them of positive tests for contact tracing and other assistance

=== Ticketing ===
==== Open Collective ====
Open Collective has the ability to handle event ticketing, and now that we've moved all expenses to Open Collective this is the easiest option for handling the finances.

{{aaronpk}}'s goal for 2021 is to not run any event finances through his bank accounts.

==== Tito ====
* '''RECOMMENDATION:''' IndieWeb has its own Tito account ([https://ti.to/indiewebcamp <tt>indiewebcamp</tt>]). Creating events on it will mean there can be year-after-year data even when organisers change. Please [[discuss#Join_Discussions|reach out in the meta chat channel]] to people who can grant you access and help setting it up!
* When using the IndieWeb Tito account it is the easiest to clone an existing event rather than create a new event. Check that the event you are cloning comes with the ticketing options you want to offer beforehand.
** To clone an event, click into the event admin interface, then choose '''Customize''', then the '''Duplicate Event''' button will appear in the top right corner
* After you make a ticket you need to add questions before making the ticket live
** You need to add questions for event attendance, preference for displaying their RSVP, and to indicate reading the code of conduct. You can add optional questions about a person's url,
*** Click on data collection in ti.to. It is under the Features tab in the left side bar.
*** Click on add a question.
*** Use checkbox(es) for codes of conduct. 
*** Add links to the required code of conduct(s). Check to see if your venue requires signing their own CoC or guidelines. Ti.to used markdown. For example: <blockquote>[IndieWeb Code of Conduct](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct)<br/>[Mozilla Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)</blockquote>
*** In the question options add a descriptor for each document participants must read and sign.
*** Make sure to select all tickets
*** Make the Code of Conduct question mandatory
*** Use a single line entry question to ask for a person's url. Leave this question as optional. 
*** Create a select box question called "Would you like to be shown on the public guest list?" 
**** Put "Yes, show me on the guest list" and then "No, hide me from the guest list" in the Question Options box. 
**** Make this question mandatory. 
**** Assign it to all tickets.
*** Use the checkbox for event days (Friday night social meetup, Saturday Conference, Sunday HackDay, etc). You do not need to assign this question to remote tickets.
* Options for Tito ticketing:
** What is the venue capacity?
*** You should set the number of available tickets to something slightly higher to account for no-shows.
** Do you want to charge for tickets?
*** This can help reduce the no-show rate
** Do you want to accept contributions to the sponsorship fund via Tito? 
*** e.g. a "Support the IndieWeb" ticket
*** Coordinate with {{aaronpk}} on getting access to the funds
** Will you be running a travel assistance program and want to accept contributions via Tito?
*** Note this requires several months of advance planning in order to have time to book travel for people far enough in advance
** ... more Tito instructions

=== Keynotes ===
Here are some ''notes'' about Keynotes at IWC/Ss so far:

* IWS has had 4+ keynotes recently. IWCs as of 2019 have 1-2 keynotes
* it could be a 10-15 minute keynote without any slides. "Keynote" usually comes with a context of "lots of hours of preparation" which we should explicitly dispell
* Keynotes are fairly new (the past few years only)
* They are not required
* The current recommendation is to contact other/previous organisers of IWCs and ask how they organised their keynotes.
* The presenter(s) do not need to be there in person, remote keynotes are also acceptable (recommendation: test the setup with the presenter in advance to make sure everyone is comfortable with the technology and it all works)

== During ==
When actually doing the IndieWebCamp, you need to at least do:
* Open the event by pointing out Code of Conduct and identifying reporting mechanism
* venue tables/chairs/projectors/whiteboards/session grid setup
* food/snack/coffee delivery (or bring in)
* pay for expenses via [[open_collective]] (recommended)
* do the [[Introductions]] session
** as part of this show and present the [[code of conduct]], also point out points of contact.
** make sure you have a number of volunteers who are available throughout the event as points of contact and who have [[code_of_conduct#Resolving_an_Issue|listed themselves on that page]] for reference.
* organize sync-up for lunches/dinners/coffee
* take photos
* run the intro/demos session
* set up Session grid with links to [[Etherpad]]s
* direct participants to [[Etherpad#How_to_take_notes_during_IndieWebCamp|How to take notes during IndieWebCamp]]
* ...
* introduce day 2 and encourage posting of hackday project goals
* try to make at least a small improvement to your own site
* regroup everyone for demos and kick it off by showing a brief demo yourself (set a good example)
* run demos

=== Closing Session ===
* thank everyone for coming
* thank the venue and the sponsors
* remind everyone to please help clean-up the venue cleaner than they found it
* last thing before starting clean-up: 
** announce '''[[events|upcoming IndieWebCamp events]]''' in-person! Both already scheduled, and especially any IndieWebCamps with recently confirmed venues and dates.
* organize collaborative cleanup and return venue to a cleaner state than when you showed up

== Tips ==
Tips for having a better, more effective, enlightening, productive, inspiring IndieWebCamp experience. Please share yours in === subheads === !

((stub section))

=== Teaching ===

Try to get a feel for the general experience level of the participants. Should there be an introductory session to [[microformats]]? Did people just drop in because they want to start running their own website?

Sitting down with people who are new to the web can be extremely beneficial for more experienced developers. When was the last time you had to explain closing HTML tags? Or how to change the font size of some text? This will also enable people to better understand the hurdles others face when they first try to start their own website.

'''Teaching can be your hackday goal.''' Maybe you do not get anything done on your own site, but someone else gets their first domain and self-written page of HTML online!

You might have to offer teaching someone. If they say they don’t want to keep you from your own project, make it clear to them that you do not mind. Keep lowering the bar.

=== Enable people to ask questions ===

People might not want to ask questions when they see everyone being busy with personal projects during hackday. Try to break the ice for them by having more seasoned people stand up and declare what they will help with. Let it be clear that they do not mind being interrupted with questions.

Are there any people willing to help setting up [[HTTPS]]? Are they willing to make time? Let them call this out. Or maybe there are people who have extensive experience with [[WordPress]]? And others are just getting started having their own website and have chosen to use WordPress? Point them at each other.

=== Put up signage pointing towards the venue ===

You can always find the logos and other printables on [https://github.com/indieweb/branding the branding GitHub repository: https://github.com/indieweb/branding]

=== Have a location pointed out for people to build ===

During the [[2023/Nuremberg|2023 Nuremberg IWC]] a specific session was proposed to “Just Build Websites”. This gave people a place to go if they did not want to join any specific track at that time.

Some venues have had this form naturally. E.g. previous Berlin meetings at the Mozilla offices had sessions in meeting rooms, and long tables outside in the common area where people got together to work on things outside of planned sessions.

If you are at a venue that does not have a natural place to hang around, it is a good idea to explicitly point one out.

== After ==
Immediately after (or during if you can keep up)
* upload & post photos on the wiki
* make sure session Etherpads are captured into session notes archives pages on the wiki. See [[Etherpad#Archiving_IndieWebCamp_notes|Etherpad: Archiving IndieWebCamp notes]]
* apply information learned from sessions to topical pages on the wiki

Evening after the IndieWebCamp has ended:
* Post publicly about '''[[events|upcoming IndieWebCamp events]]!''' in-person! Both already scheduled, and make a separate post for each additional newly confirmed IndieWebCamp (i.e. recently confirmed venues and dates). Direct the excitement from the completed event into looking forward to the next IndieWebCamps!

That same evening or within a few days at most!
* '''Thank Attendees''', send out some sort of notification/email/text to all attendees summarizing all the awesomeness at the event and ways they can continue participating (chat, upcoming events, newsletter etc.)
** See [[message-after-iwc]] for message templates to use!

Upload videos from the sessions
* If there are [https://indieweb.org/remote_participation#Archiving recordings and/or remote participation] you will need to upload the videos.

== FAQ ==
{{main|FAQ}}
=== Why is there a high bar for registering ===
Q: Who is IndieWebCamp for?

# '''Personal site passion.''' IndieWebCamp is focused on the [[IndieWeb]] and those that are passionate about it firsthand. 
#* Are you passionate about having & using your own website for your identity and your content? 
#* Then IndieWebCamp may be for you!
# '''Having a personal site.''' Having a personal site shows that you're willing to invest the few minutes it takes to buy a domain and set it up. Want to but don't know how? Check out [[Getting Started]]. Which brings us to:
# '''Interested in learning.''' IndieWebCamp is for folks hungry to learn about how to make themselves even more independent on the web. 
#* One measure of a desire to learn is, do you have the time and patience to read? Check out the [[Getting Started]] page as an example.
#* Beyond reading, another measure of the desire to learn is to practice what you've learned. Did you <em>try</em> following the steps in [[Getting Started]]? Which brings us to:
# '''Ok asking for help'''. IndieWebCamp is a community which partly means we help each other out, which definitely means that asking for help is strongly encouraged! 
#* Are you ok with asking for help? 
#* Did you get stuck with any part of [[Getting Started]]?
#* Did you ask in our [https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today?beta#bottom Chat Forum]?
#* If you're in one of the cities they happen, did you come to [[Homebrew_Website_Club|Homebrew Website Club]] to get started?
#* We are building a community of people who are comfortable with admitting they don't know everything, and thus actively ask questions. Which is also another indicator of interested in learning.
# '''Setting up [[IndieAuth]]'''. This takes mere minutes, with the help of [[Getting Started]], and if you get stuck, our chat forum. By spending just a <em>few minutes</em> setting up your site with IndieAuth, you demonstrate that there's a much better chance you will be productive for <em>several hours</em> at IndieWebCamp, both with working on your own site, and hopefully with collaborating with other such creators as well!
# '''Adding yourself to the wiki'''. This also takes mere minutes, and very importantly demonstrates that you are willing to make at least small edits to the wiki. 
#* IndieWebCamp as a community thrives and depends on community contributions of time:
#** to setup and run IndieWebCamps
#** to lead and participate in sessions
#** to take collaborative notes in Etherpad
#** but most importantly, <strong>to contribute to our community wiki</strong>. 
#* By [[wikifying]], yourself, session notes, and helping improve subject matter pages, you demonstrate that you're not only interested in the IndieWeb, but in IndieWebCamp as a community, and that commitment to community is important to us. 
#* If that's not your thing, that's ok too, you may use all of the resources on the IndieWebCamp wiki <em>for free</em>, CC0, because that's how strongly we believe in this community. 
#* We do want you to benefit from the wiki, regardless of whether you contribute to the wiki or not. 
#* IndieWebCamps events themselves are specifically for this community, for those that believe in contributing to and helping to grow an intentional positive community, and enjoy doing so.

== Update IndieWebCamp Template ==
Update [[Template:IndieWebCamp|this template]] to include your camp when you've at least locked down a date, venue, and 2+ co-organizers:
