'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Organizing</dfn>''' is a great way to bring together your local IndieWeb community, yet is also quite challenging, requires co-organizers, and key details to succeed that are documented in this page.

If you have never organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] before:
* Consider first organizing a [[Homebrew_Website_Club#Structure|Homebrew Website Club meetup]]. It's a lot less work, and will help you get experience with planning and organizing IndieWeb [[events]]. It's also a good way to begin to help seed local attendance for a bigger camp.

Note: You need '''at least 5 participants (at least 4 in-person)''' to have a meaningful IndieWebCamp (learned from past successful IndieWebCamps). If you cannot get 5+ people together locally, consider organizing an IndieWebCamp [[Online]] instead, or keep organizing regular [[Homebrew_Website_Club#Structure|Homebrew Website Club meetup]]s until you grow your local community large enough that 5 or more of them will commit to participating in an IndieWebCamp.

== Before ==
To organize an IndieWebCamp, you need:
# '''2-4 organizers''' - in practice that's worked best. 
#* only 1 organizer means more chance things get dropped on the floor
#* having co-organizers helps keep mutual motivation going, everyone encourages everyone else
#* At least one '''detail-oriented''' co-organizer. If that's not you, get one. If you lack one, it's unlikely to succeed.
#* At least one '''onsite''' co-organizer (or someone who works at the organization hosting the venue).
#* Thus 2 is the minimum viable: 1 for physical venue stuffs, 1 for detail-oriented virtual stuffs. Avoid making that the same person as it will likely burn them out.
#* 4 is what [[2011]] had
#* More than 4 hasn't happened in practice.
# '''Add to [[Planning]]''' even if you just want to start the idea, add it to [[Planning]]
# '''Simple wiki page''' with the year and city. Start with just minimal notes and questions, e.g. see the [http://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?title=2014/NYC&oldid=5527 first version of 2014/NYC].
## If your event is multiple days, have notations for what portion people will attend for.
# '''Divide up key organizing''' responsibilities (venue, sponsors, food, tables/chairs, volunteers)
# '''Venue''' with network access (donated / sponsored)
# '''Sponsors''', either dedicated (see recent IndieWebCamps for an explicit list) or via [[open_collective]], for:
#* food
#* travel assistance (see 2016.indieweb.org example)
#* kid related or child care (note available upon request (e.g. [https://www.facebook.com/events/275011629503233/permalink/289758028028593/]), make preparations for all day both days)
# '''Update wiki page''' as more is known, including creating subpages
#* details: Where (address), When (start time, end time)
#* include a subheading '''Participating''' that has links to:
#** [[Code of Conduct]]
#** Session proposals
#** Schedule grid
#** Demos
#** [[Discussion]]
#* event cover image - use a photo of the venue, preferably recognizable (note: please avoid re-using the old 2014 icon/avatar grid)
# '''YYYY.indieweb.org/cityname indie event page''' - setup an indie [[event]] page for folks to RSVP to and with an area for ticketing
# '''<span id="Ticketing">Ticketing</span>''' - setup a way to RSVP via a ticketing system like [[Tito]] or brownpapertickets
#* TO-DO: Document how to setup a Tito ticket for an IndieWebCamp including key pieces like:
#** Basic Info: Attendee full name (if possible instead of separate first/last), Attendee email, checkboxes for CoC & Moz CPG: <blockquote>[ ] Agree to [https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct IndieWeb Code of Conduct]<br/>[ ] Agree to [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/ Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines]</blockquote>which must be required to be checked (but default unchecked) for the form.
#** "Would you like to be shown on the public guest list?" (Default: "Yes, show me on the guest list")
#** ... more Tito instructions
# '''Optional: More event tracking''' - feel free to also manually POSSE the event to [[Facebook]] or other event tracking systems to help folks who use such systems to keep track of the event and invite others
# '''Track venue capacity''', waitlist if necessary
# '''Remind Attendees''', send out some sort of notification/email/text to all attendees and remind them of the event in advance.
#* See [[message-before-iwc]] for message templates to use!

== Packing ==
See: '''[[IndieWebCamp kit]]''' for a list of items to consider ordering beforehand

Stuff to bring (doubtful a venue has, thus see [[IndieWebCamp kit]])
# Nametags
# Large Postit notes/papers for scheduling
# Stickers

Stuff to borrow from a venue (and bring if they lack)
# Surge Protectors/Power Strips/Extension Cords - We all need power, and best to make it easy to secure.
# Displayport Adapter
# Markers
# Video streaming kit and microphones.

== During ==
When actually doing the IndieWebCamp, you need to at least do:
* venue tables/chairs/projectors/whiteboards/session grid setup
* food/snack/coffee delivery (or bring in)
* pay for expenses via [[open_collective]] (recommended)
* do the [[Introductions]] session
** as part of this show and present the [[code of conduct]], also point out points of contact.
** make sure you have a number of volunteers who are available throughout the event as points of contact and who have [[code_of_conduct#Resolving_an_Issue|listed themselves on that page]] for reference.
* organize sync-up for lunches/dinners/coffee
* take photos
* run the demo session
* set up Session grid with links to [[Etherpad]]s
* direct participants to [[Etherpad#How_to_take_notes_during_IndieWebCamp|How to take notes during IndieWebCamp]]
* organize collaborative cleanup and return venue to a cleaner state than when you showed up


== Tips ==
Tips for having a better, more effective, enlightening, productive, inspiring IndieWebCamp experience. Please share yours in === subheads === !

((stub section))

=== Teaching ===

Try to get a feel for the general experience level of the participants. Should there be an introductory session to [[microformats]]? Did people just drop in because they want to start running their own website?

Sitting down with people who are new to the web can be extremely beneficial for more experienced developers. When was the last time you had to explain closing HTML tags? Or how to change the font size of some text? This will also enable people to better understand the hurdles others face when they first try to start their own website.

'''Teaching can be your hackday goal.''' Maybe you do not get anything done on your own site, but someone else gets their first domain and self-written page of HTML online!

You might have to offer teaching someone. If they say they donâ€™t want to keep you from your own project, make it clear to them that you do not mind. Keep lowering the bar.

=== Enable people to ask questions ===

People might not want to ask questions when they see everyone being busy with personal projects during hackday. Try to break the ice for them by having more seasoned people stand up and declare what they will help with. Let it be clear that they do not mind being interrupted with questions.

Are there any people willing to help setting up [[HTTPS]]? Are they willing to make time? Let them call this out. Or maybe there are people who have extensive experience with [[WordPress]]? And others are just getting started having their own website and have chosen to use WordPress? Point them at each other.


== After ==
After (or during if you can keep up)
* upload & post photos on the wiki
* make sure session Etherpads are captured into session notes archives pages on the wiki
* apply information learned from sessions to topical pages on the wiki

== FAQ ==
{{main|FAQ}}
=== Why is there a high bar for registering ===
Q: Why is there a high bar for registering for an IndieWebCamp event? (signing in using IndieAuth and adding yourself to the wiki)

A: In short, because we have very high respect for IndieWeb [[creators]] and especially for their time.

IndieWeb [[creators]] that participate in IndieWebCamp create (code/UX/design/style/graphics) and openly share & contribute at least some of their creations.

Longer: to see if IndieWebCamp is right for you. See also: [[FAQ#Who_is_the_audience_for_IndieWebCamp_events|Who is the audience for IndieWebCamp]].

Every aspect of signing up for IndieWebCamp has been deliberately designed for you and other creators to be maximally productive during your scarce and valuable time at IndieWebCamp.

# '''Personal site passion.''' IndieWebCamp is focused on the [[IndieWeb]] and those that are passionate about it firsthand. 
#* Are you passionate about having & using your own website for your identity and your content? 
#* Then IndieWebCamp may be for you!
# '''Having a personal site.''' Having a personal site shows that you're willing to invest the few minutes it takes to buy a domain and set it up. Want to but don't know how? Check out [[Getting Started]]. Which brings us to:
# '''Interested in learning.''' IndieWebCamp is for folks hungry to learn about how to make themselves even more independent on the web. 
#* One measure of a desire to learn is, do you have the time and patience to read? Check out the [[Getting Started]] page as an example.
#* Beyond reading, another measure of the desire to learn is to practice what you've learned. Did you <em>try</em> following the steps in [[Getting Started]]? Which brings us to:
# '''Ok asking for help'''. IndieWebCamp is a community which partly means we help each other out, which definitely means that asking for help is strongly encouraged! 
#* Are you ok with asking for help? 
#* Did you get stuck with any part of [[Getting Started]]?
#* Did you ask in our [https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today?beta#bottom Chat Forum]?
#* If you're in one of the cities they happen, did you come to [[Homebrew_Website_Club|Homebrew Website Club]] to get started?
#* We are building a community of people who are comfortable with admitting they don't know everything, and thus actively ask questions. Which is also another indicator of interested in learning.
# '''Setting up [[IndieAuth]]'''. This takes mere minutes, with the help of [[Getting Started]], and if you get stuck, our chat forum. By spending just a <em>few minutes</em> setting up your site with IndieAuth, you demonstrate that there's a much better chance you will be productive for <em>several hours</em> at IndieWebCamp, both with working on your own site, and hopefully with collaborating with other such creators as well!
# '''Adding yourself to the wiki'''. This also takes mere minutes, and very importantly demonstrates that you are willing to make at least small edits to the wiki. 
#* IndieWebCamp as a community thrives and depends on community contributions of time:
#** to setup and run IndieWebCamps
#** to lead and participate in sessions
#** to take collaborative notes in Etherpad
#** but most importantly, <strong>to contribute to our community wiki</strong>. 
#* By [[wikifying]], yourself, session notes, and helping improve subject matter pages, you demonstrate that you're not only interested in the IndieWeb, but in IndieWebCamp as a community, and that commitment to community is important to us. 
#* If that's not your thing, that's ok too, you may use all of the resources on the IndieWebCamp wiki <em>for free</em>, CC0, because that's how strongly we believe in this community. 
#* We do want you to benefit from the wiki, regardless of whether you contribute to the wiki or not. 
#* IndieWebCamps events themselves are specifically for this community, for those that believe in contributing to and helping to grow an intentional positive community, and enjoy doing so.

== Update IndieWebCamp Template ==
Update this to include your camp when you've at least locked down a date, venue, and 2+ co-organizers:
{{IndieWebCamp}}
