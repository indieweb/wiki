* Jeffrey Zeldman: [https://web.archive.org/web/20060715144512/http://www.independentsday.org/project_2424/jeffrey_zeldman.php The Independent Content Producer Refuses to Die!] (Internet Archive link) <blockquote><p>By creating and maintaining sites that cannot be controlled, compromised, disfigured or deleted by the indifference or poor judgement of clients or managers, you will ensure that you always have good work to show for yourself. More importantly, you'll have the chance to express yourself -- to find out what you, yourself are made of when, no client is paying you. To find out what you really want to say.</p><p>â€¦ in independent web production, the only unknown quantity in your budget is how much time you can afford.</p><p>No one is in control of this space. No one can tell you how to '''[[design]]''' it, how much to '''design''' it, when to "dial it down." No one will hold your hand and structure it for you. No one will create the content for you.</p><p>What's in you? What thwarted creative potential is burning to get out, grow, and find its audience?</p><p>If you do this well, it will reflect back into the work you do for your clients. Not only will this help your career, it will enrich your life, and the lives of others.</p><p>Creating your content, '''designing''' it your way, repositioning yourself from vendor to author, you'll have made your mark on the medium, and perhaps on your generation.</p><p>And at the very least, you'll have had '''[[fun]]''' trying.</p></blockquote>'''Emphasis''' added to point out shared [[principles]]. Note the emphasis on '''design''' (three references), and finishing with '''fun''' (last of our [[principles]]).

Anyone with talent and something to say will be able to say it just as loud as the Big Boys with Deep Pockets. </li></ol></blockquote>
