The '''<dfn>IndieWeb</dfn>''' is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the '''[[principles|principles]]''' of '''[[personal-domain|owning your domain]]''', using it as '''[[How to set up web sign-in on your own domain|your primary identity]]''', to '''[[POSSE|publish on your own site]]''' (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and '''[[ownyourdata|own your data]]'''.

=== Get started ===
Want to get started on the IndieWeb? See: 
* '''[[Getting Started]]'''

=== Learn more about IndieWeb ===
* [[what]] and [[why]]
* [[principles|IndieWeb principles]]
* [[ownyourdata|owning your data]]
* [[personal-domain|what is a personal domain]]

=== Learn more about IndieWeb standards ===
* [[Webmention]] - to notify other websites
* [[WebSub]] - to get real time updates on other sites' new content
* [[Micropub]] - to publish to your site with an ease
* [[IndieAuth]] - to authenticate with your website

=== Learn more about syndication (cross-posting content) ===
* [[POSSE]] - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere
* [[PESOS]] - Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site
* other methods of [[cross-posting]]

=== You can ===
* [[multi-site_indieweb|have more than one such personal domain]].
* use your own domain for purely a ''professional'' identity facet, preferring to keep anything personal off the internet/web. That's totally fine.

=== You might ===
* Have an [[h-card]] on your '''[[home page]]''' with your contact info.
* Link to "other profiles" from your home page with '''[[rel=me]]'''.
* Use your '''domain as your identity''' with [[IndieAuth]].
* Appreciate and practice IndieWeb '''[[principles]]'''

=== Content hosting possibilities ===
* You own your own domain but use [[Tumblr]].com or [[WordPress.com]] or some other '''hosted content solution''' to publish content (like [[posts]]) on your site. You own your permalinks so you can change hosting and (with some work) keep your permalinks working.
* You use a full-service '''web site hosting service''' and have them maintain a [[WordPress]] or other [[CMS]] install and databases for you.
* You use a [[web hosting]] service and '''maintain your own''' WordPress or other CMS [[project]] install, backup your content (files and/or databases) etc.

=== Not IndieWeb ===
* Just having a subdomain on a content hosting site, e.g. person1.blogger.com, person2.wordpress.com, etc. They still own your permalinks.
* Just having a profile page on a content hosting [[silo]], e.g. twitter.com/person1 flickr.com/person2
* In both cases you're still subject to their policies on names and they could trivially give your name/identity away, e.g. as [http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/04/27/tumblr-disappeared-me.html what happened with danah boyd] and zephoria.tumblr.com (recovered only after public outcry), or [http://infovore.org/archives/2011/06/12/wheres-towerbridge/ the Tower Bridge] on twitter.com/towerbridge (involuntarily re-assigned without notice).
