'''<dfn>Indigenous for Android</dfn>''' is a native app for Android that supports posting to your website using [[Micropub]] and a built-in [[reader]] that supports [[Microsub]]. Other account types allow you to connect with the Fediverse: Mastodon, Pixelfed and Pleroma

The [[project]] is under active development by {{Marksuth.dev}} and is available on [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indieweb.indigenous Google Play] and [https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.indieweb.indigenous/ F-Droid]. The source code can be found on [https://github.com/swentel/indigenous-android GitHub]. There is also an [https://indieweb.org/Indigenous_for_iOS iOS version].

On 12 Nov 2021 {{Marksuth.dev}} took over as maintainer of the Android app, after previously taking over maintaining the [https://indieweb.org/Indigenous_for_iOS iOS] and [https://indieweb.org/Indigenous_for_desktop desktop] versions in September.
