'''<dfn>Indiepaper</dfn>''' is a "[[read later]]" service, in the spirit of Instapaper, for the IndieWeb. Source is available, but you can use Indiepaper through its public endpoint at https://indiepaper.io.

The website includes a tool to generate a "Read Later" bookmarklet. It also includes links to an iOS Workflow and a native macOS application for system-wide sharing integration on macOS.
