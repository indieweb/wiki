'''<dfn>[https://archive.is/eJLHc IndieForums]</dfn>''' was an IndieWeb [[friendly]] [[forum]] that allowed users to post content or replies on their own site and cross post to the forum automatically using [[Webmention]] notifications both to the forum itself and to the [[original post]]s on other authors' websites. 

As of at least 2025-12-28, the domain appears to have been lost and is now a [[phpBB]] forum with (likely) spam.

The site was built by [https://www.timculverhouse.com/ Tim Culverhouse] as a proof-of-concept in May 2021. The code for the site is available on GitHub: https://github.com/rockorager/indieforums, though was archived 2023-03-07.

The project was built using:
* [[11ty]] to build the site
* [[Github]] to host the repository
* [[Netlify]] to host the site
* [[Webmention.io]] to receive webmentions

Similar sorts of [[discovery]] services can be seen in [[IndieNews]] and [[Indieweb.xyz]].
