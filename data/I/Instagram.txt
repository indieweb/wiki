'''<dfn>[http://instagram.com/ Instagram]</dfn>''' is a popular [[photo]] and short [[video]] hosting [[silo]] most well known for square [[photos]] that have been processed with an image filter. 
{{clear}}
== Why ==
Should I join Instagram? Why use Instagram?
=== Indie photo posting client ===
Some of us have found it to be a useful client for posting to your site via [[Micropub]] and [[ownyourgram]].

If your site supports receiving [[Micropub]] requests for publishing photos, you may want to consider creating a private Instagram account, using it to setup [[ownyourgram]], and then use Instagram’s native mobile app(s) and servers purely as a convenient client for posting [[photo]]s and short [[video]]s to your own site.

This technique of using a silo purely as a client to get content to your own site is also referred to as "silos as plumbing".

See '''[[#PESOS|PESOS]]''' below for more details.

== Features ==
(this section is a stub and needs your contribution to complete it!)
* [[photo]] post with:
** reduced resolution photo, e.g. 1080x810
** a caption (is just the first comment if it is by the author)
** [[hashtags]] in caption or any comment by author, hyperlinked inline
*** [[#Hashtags_limited_to_30|limitation: 30 per post]].
** [[person-tags]] at locations (points) on the photo
** [[venue]] (from [[Facebook]]'s venue database)

** even lower resolution than single photo posts, e.g.: 750x750, 640x640
** a caption (is just the first comment if it is by the author)
** inline hyperlinked [[hashtags]]
** limitations: no photo editing (filters only), must be square cropped

==Exporting your data==
On 2018-04-25 instagram launched an archive retrieval process, accessible at [https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/download/request/ https://www.instagram.com/download/request/]. There is a 48 hour window cited for instagram to comply with an archive request.

Downloaded data consists of 
* Photos, in folders sorted by month, in jpg format at 72dpi
* Comments, likes, contacts and similar information in .json format

[http://instaport.me/ Instaport.me] and [http://flickstagram.org flickstagram.org] let you export your Instagram photos.

[http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your Instagram photos and videos to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and all comments intact.

Norm's [https://github.com/norm/instagram-backup instagram-backup] tool exports Instagram photos and metadata.

=== Single Photo Bookmarklet ===
If you view a single photo permalink page, the following bookmarklet will extract the permalink (trimmed), photo jpg URL, and photo caption and copy them into a text note, suitable for posting as a [[photo]] that's [[auto-link]]ed:

For plain text:
<pre>
javascript:n=document.images.length-1;s=document.images[n].src;s=s.split('?');s=s[0];u=document.location.toString().substring(0,39);prompt('Choose "Copy ⌘C" to copy photo post:',s+' '+u+'\n'+document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].innerText.replace(/\n\.(\n\.)+/g,'\n'))
</pre>

For HTML (e.g. storage files. escapes & < >)
<pre>
javascript:n=document.images.length-1;s=document.images[n].src;s=s.split('?');s=s[0];u=document.location.toString().substring(0,39);prompt('Choose "Copy ⌘C" to copy photo post:',s+' '+u+'\n'+document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].innerText.replace(/\n\.(\n\.)+/g,'\n').replace(/\&/g,'&amp;amp;').replace(/\</g,'&amp;lt;').replace(/\>/g,'&amp;gt;'))
</pre>

Any questions, let me know! {{t}} (I used the second version ("For HTML") myself as part of my [[photo]] post authoring flow until 2017-085. -t).

Drag and drop-able button version can be found [http://boffosocko.com/2016/08/28/instagram-single-photo-bookmarklet/ here]

==== Bookmarklet improvements ====
* remove errant username from start of caption text
* support [[multi-photo]] posts (detecting, producing markup)
* support [[video]] posts (detecting, producing markup)
* support mixed multi-photo/video posts

==POSSE==
Instagram does not have a photo upload API. <strike>However they do have comments delete / create APIs</strike>. <b>Sadly commenting via the API is not supported</b>. So here's how you can fake POSSE to Instagram:

# You post to Instagram using their client app, including location information, people tags, and caption (first comment).
# Your server receives a notification of the photo post via webhook call back
# Your server copies the photo (in [[PESOS]] fashion) to your own server
## creating a permalink for the photo on your own server
## copying the location information, people tags, and caption
## adding a link to the copy of the photo on Instagram with [[u-syndication]]
# Your server deletes the first comment on the Instagram photo
# Your server creates a new first comment (thus caption) on the Instagram photo, as you, with:
## original caption contents followed by [[permashortlink]] for the photo on your server

And bingo, you've effectively created a POSSE copy of your photo on Instagram since it now has a permashortlink back to the new "original" on your own site.

At this point you can also use a service like [[Bridgy]] to [[backfeed]] comments on the photo from Instagram to your own site.

=== POSSE via private API ===

Instagram has a private, undocumented API that is used by the web client. You can use this API to do almost anything the web client can do, but is likely to be changed at any moment.

{{grantcodes}} automatically POSSEs likes, photo posts and galleries to instagram by resizing his photos and sending the data to the private api with a [https://www.npmjs.com/package/instagram-private-api npm package].

=== PESOS from Instagram ===
Since Instagram doesn't have an API to post photos, many people use [https://ownyourgram.com ownyourgram.com] to do the reverse: post photos to Instagram and have the service post them back to their website. To use this, your site will need to support [[Micropub]].

=== POSSE responses ===
* {{kylewm}} POSSEs likes for Instagram photos via the official Instagram API (which is read-only for everything except, inexplicably, for likes) [https://kylewm.com/2015/01/like-of-kristen-parks-cuba-bound-with-juliannarosed since 2015-01-03] 
** Added POSSE for comments via "unofficial" API (Selenium/PhantomJS browser automation) [https://kylewm.com/2015/07/yum-lechuga on 2015-07-12]
* [[Bridgy]] Publish can POSSE [[likes]] to Instagram since 2015-01-07
* ...

=== POSSE via Workflow.is ===
{{Sebsel}} uses the iOS app [[Workflow]] to semi-automate his photo posting workflow, including a post to Instagram. He documented his Workflow workflow on [[Workflow]].

=== POSSE via SNAP with WordPress ===
While {{chrisaldrich}} most often uses a [[PESOS]] workflow involving [https://wordpress.org/plugins/dsgnwrks-instagram-importer/ DsgnWrks Instagram Importer], he will occasionally use the pro version of the [[SNAP]] plugin for [[WordPress]] which is able to post photos directly to Instagram using their [https://www.nextscripts.com/snap-api-premium-for-wordpress/ custom API]. [https://www.nextscripts.com/instructions/instagram-auto-poster-setup-installation/ Instructions] for setting up SNAP to do this can be found on their site.

=== POSSE as mobile browser ===
Instagram recently updated their mobile web site to [https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/8/15562892/instagram-mobile-browser-photo-upload allow mobile web photo posts], thus it should be possible to have your server POSSE to Instagram for you by acting as your mobile browser.

Also looking into this for Bridgy Publish support:
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/746 Publish: re-investigate POSSE to Instagram now with mobile browser photo posting]

=== Manual POSSE ===
==== gRegor Morrill ====
{{gRegor}} posts photos on gregorlove.com first, manually posts the same photo and caption to Instagram, copies the Instagram URL and adds it as a [[syndication]] link on the original photo post.
* since 2016-04-05 https://gregorlove.com/2016/04/polka-dots-in-my-backyard/
* commonly will use [[Bridgy Publish]] to syndicate to [[Twitter]] as well.
* originally was including my URL in the Instagram caption, but discovered Bridgy does not need that; the syndication link is enough for Bridgy [[backfeed]].
* yes, this is a bit of slow process, so I don't post photos very often. :]

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} posts photos on [[Swarm]] (private account) for ease of mobile publishing, then uses those to create photo posts on tantek.com, and manually posts the same photo and (sometimes abbreviated) caption to Instagram, copies the Instagram URL and adds it as a [[syndication]] link on the original photo post.
* since 2017-087: http://tantek.com/2017/087/t2/orange-curls-flower
* uses Bridgy Publish to POSSE to FB, Flickr, Twitter also

=== Manual Notes ===
<span id="Manual_Notes_POSSE">Some users manually</span> cross-post occasional [[notes]] posts to Instagram, e.g.:
==== Tweet text to Instagram ====
* Original: https://twitter.com/ClaireWyckoff/status/532912362991648768 <blockquote>Worst way to die: you're mauled by a zombie and as you're about to turn you realize he's wearing Ed Hardy.</blockquote>
* POSSE copy: http://instagram.com/p/vWDDFlyTL8/
{{photosrcalt|1=https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/10693307_1492129594399372_2131465102_n.jpg}}

As of this edit:
* the original has only *2* favorites. (2,346 followers on account)
* the POSSE copy: *130* likes and *3* comments. (14,512 followers on account)
For some reason, POSSE copies, even of *notes*, on Instagram receive more [[interactions]] per follower.

Hypothesis: the Instagram [[reader]] experience is so much smoother and nicer that it tends to encourage more use and thus more interactions.

==== IndieWeb note to Instagram ====
* Original: http://tantek.com/2016/001/t4/burn-very-brightly <blockquote>The light that burns twice as bright, <br/>burns half as long <br/>Life’s short, <br/>so burn very brightly</blockquote>

== PESOS ==
* {{aaronpk}}'s [[OwnYourGram]] service provides [[PESOS]] from Instagram for any site that supports micropub.

Additional approaches:
* Solutions for [[WordPress]]:
** [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-social-importers/ Keyring Social Importers] can will automatically create photo posts out of Instagram content once connected
** [https://wordpress.org/plugins/dsgnwrks-instagram-importer/ DsgnWrks Instagram Importer] will do the same
* [https://github.com/johnholdun/instagram-feed John Holdun's Instagram Feed] for a locally-hosted mirror for your Instagram feed
* Just do it manually

=== Previously Tantek ===
{{t}} uses his [[iPod]] Touch to publish photos to [[Swarm]] and Instagram for ease of posting from mobile device to the web.

Previously:

From [http://tantek.com/2015/244/t1/did-entire-npsf-trackattack 2015-244] to [http://tantek.com/2017/085/t2/droplets-leaf-tips-plants 2017-085], {{t}} did manual PESOS from Instagram to public posts on his own site (tantek.com), and then used [[Falcon]] to automatically [[POSSE]] his [[photo]] posts to [[Facebook]], Flickr, & [[Twitter]] with [[Bridgy]] Publish, as well as link back to the Instagram copy as [[syndication]].

[http://tantek.com/2017/087/t2/orange-curls-flower Since 2017-087], {{t}} has been manually POSSEing to Instagram (see [[#Tantek]] above).

==== cweiske ====
{{cweiske}} uses [https://github.com/cweiske/instagram2micropub instagram2micropub] to archive private instagram posts to a self-hosted [[Known]] instance automatically.

== backfeed ==

You can use [[Bridgy]] to get some backfeed of responses from Instagram POSSE copies.

(this section is a stub)

* limitations with Brid.gy: only first 10 likes come through.
** Scraping the public Instagram web pages only gives you the oldest 10 likes for a picture. After that, the UI says 'and X others' anyway. The property is called <code>edge_media_preview_like</code>, and includes a full count, but no names, pictures or URLs of the people who like it, other than the first 10. (You can't poll either, because they give you the first, not the last.)

You can supposedly get your own API key (in sandbox mode) to do your own backfeed. (does anyone do this?)

* Getting likes seems to be impossible without getting your app approved. Some endpoints work, others give a HTTP 200 status, but an empty array.
** '''/users/self/media/recent''' works, probably because it contains you own pictures
** '''/media/:id/likes''' does not work, probably because the likes are other people's content
** '''/users/self/media/liked''' does not work, probably because your likes contain other people's content
* Getting your app approved seems to be [https://www.instagram.com/developer/review/ hard].

== API ==
=== Supposed Features and Limitations ===
* Instagram's [http://instagram.com/developer official API] can potentially create (and delete) comments and likes, but not photos.
=== Like ===
{{snarfed}} has found that Instagram's API now supports progammatically "liking" photos (used to 400).
=== Location ===
* [http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/ location of photos] - indicates use of [[Facebook]] places ID, [[Foursquare]] venue id (both v1 and v2 of their API)
=== Cannot Comment ===
{{snarfed}} has found that authing with scope=comments works, but the API call still 400s.

According to [http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/comments/#post_media_comments Instagram's API documentation],  their commenting API only works for those who are whitelisted. Unfortunately the [http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/comments/#post_media_comments criteria for application for whitelisting] are very restrictive.

=== Unofficial ===
* Work has also been done on determining its unofficial API (which is against Instagram's terms of service, but allows you to post): https://github.com/mislav/instagram/wiki
* Instagram Worm uploaded photos using private/undocumented API (needs citation)
* Instagram private API changes [http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/30/4570610/instagram-deleting-photos-from-instance-windows-phone-app affect unofficial apps and photos uploaded via unofficial apps]
* Add <code>?__a=1</code> to the end of an Instagram profile, photo, or feed URL (e.g. <code>/</code>) to get JSON metadata. This JSON is also embedded in the normal HTML pages. [https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/1ca5995846f9b471fce0ff2cd9a06a55b11cc421/granary/instagram.py#L706 Example parsing code in granary.]
** For feed URLs, the array of photo objects is in the <code>FeedPage.feed.media.nodes[]</code> element.
** For profile URLs, the array of photo objects is in the <code>ProfilePage.user.media.nodes[]</code> element.
** For photo URLs, the photo objects are the <code>PostPage[].media</code> element(s).
* The private API is rate limited to 60 photos per hour

=== Permissions approval ===

Instagram is [http://developers.instagram.com/post/133424514006/instagram-platform-update locking down their API and requiring all apps to go through a review process] similar to [[Facebook]]'s. Apps can apply now; the API restrictions start in June 2016. [https://www.instagram.com/developer/review/ Developer details], [https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/ legal details].

Specifically, they plan to restrict and require approval for <code>/users/self/feed</code> and <code>/media/popular</code> and any use cases that send photos outside of Instagram.

Here's the [https://www.instagram.com/developer/authorization/ new set of permissions] (OAuth scopes):

<blockquote>
* basic - to read a user’s profile info and media (granted by default)
* public_content - to read any public profile info and media on a user’s behalf
* follower_list - to read the list of followers and followed-by users
* comments - to post and delete comments on a user’s behalf
* relationships - to follow and unfollow accounts on a user’s behalf
* likes - to like and unlike media on a user’s behalf
</blockquote>

{{snarfed}} [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/603 applied for basic permissions for Bridgy and oauth-dropins] in Jan 2016. Both were rejected.

==UX Observation==
* Videos and Photos have a very similar UI. --[[User:Bret.io|Bret.io]] 00:38, 1 July 2013 (PDT)
** Differences include a large play button on load for videos, and a caption display for photos.
** [http://instagram.com/p/bMlGL1g9RG/ Example of video]
** [http://instagram.com/p/bMj4vvA9ez/ Example of photo]

* 2013 video UI: single-tapping would pause the video, you have to tap the play control to replay.
* 2015 videos started autolooping (like [[Vine]]) without sound, and single-tapping was changed to toggle sound on/off.

== Adoption ==
* 2015-05-18 [http://www.refinery29.com/2015/05/87512/instagram-only-fashion-bloggers The Newest Fashion Bloggers Don't Even Have Blogs] - they use Instagram instead.

== Issues ==
=== Hashtags limited to 30 ===
Instagram limits the number of [[hashtag]]s that you can put on a post to 30. If you try to add more, your comment is rejected with the unhelpful and misleading error message: <blockquote style="color:red">Couldn't post. Tap to retry</blockquote>  (no amount of retrying will help, so why ask the user to do so?)

[[File:2018-006-ig-hashtag-limit-err.png|480px]]

When attempting to add even just single hashtags as comments to https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc_ETrOFTAW

== Criticism ==

=== username takeovers ===

[https://medium.com/@ainiesta/how-instagram-closed-my-account-and-gave-it-to-a-football-celebrity-625a6a770eb3 How Instagram closed my account and gave it to a football celebrity] - "My name is Andrés Iniesta and my only mistake was having the exact name and last name as a famous football player."

[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16513747 "Someone stole my Instagram username"]

===Bad Silo Interop with Twitter===
Shortly after it was purchased by Facebook, [http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/ Instagram stopped including Twitter metadata] on their photo pages, so Twitter Cards no longer show image previews for Instagram photos.

Instagram drives more traffic to their site, at the cost of a worse experience for users.

Using [[OwnYourGram]] or another method of PESOSing your photos out of Instagram, you can control how your photos are shared on other silos like Twitter. (e.g., by including Twitter metadata, or by posting the photos directly).

=== Switch from Foursquare to Facebook venues ===
Some time in 2014-05, Instagram switched from using [[Foursquare]]'s venue database (e.g. in the iOS app UI) to using [[Facebook]]'s places database.

This has resulted in:
* fewer venue matches (often completely missing venues that were present on Foursquare)
* less accurate venue locations such as misspellings, "venues" with varied granularity (business vs neighborhood)
* loss of venue information when cross-posting from Instagram to Foursquare (i.e. checks you into the wrong location, or a generic neighborhood rather than a specific venue)

Articles about worse Instagram locations due to using Facebook venues:
* 2014-05-11 https://twitter.com/parislemon/status/465554365286084608 <blockquote>Instagram's decision to use Facebook's much worse place database over Foursquare's has made the product worse. Stupid.</blockquote>
* 2014-05-11 https://twitter.com/parislemon/status/465555168851816448 <blockquote>The moment a decision is made for business/political reasons, the product starts to decay. Even if only a little bit.</blockquote>
* 2014-05-12 <cite>[https://medium.com/five-hundred-words/dad4c3736409 Instagram Just Geotagged Us To Hell]</cite>

=== Lack of privacy of location data ===
When posting a photo to Instagram, if "add to photo map" is enabled (even if no venue is chosen) then the exact lat/lng of the photo is recorded. When viewing the single photo you won't see the location of it. However, when viewing the person's user profile you can switch to the map view and see their photos all on a map. 

[[File:instagram-map-aaronpk-far.png|300px]]
[[File:instagram-map-aaronpk-close.png|300px]]

The map shows photos as clusters, and zooming in will expand the clusters into smaller clusters until finally individual photos appear on the map. 

It is relatively easy to figure out the approximate location of someone's work or home by looking for these clusters.

* https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/link-in-bio/537624/

=== Uneditable Custom Locations ===
When adding a photo at a venue that doesn't exist, it is possible to create a "custom location", which is unfortunately not editable from that point on. 

One potential up-side is when searching for venues, your custom locations now show up at the top of the list without needing a round-trip to the server to search.

[[File:instagram-custom-location-search.png]]

Creating this custom location prompts only for the name, the exact geo location is added automatically, meaning it is not possible to adjust the specific location of the venue.

=== Censorship beyond community guidelines ===
Instagram is establishing a history of censoring by removing (and sometimes restoring later)  and/or hashtag results that are not actual violations of their Community Guidelines, and are otherwise innocuous material. For example:

; gay kiss
: Instagram has [http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/instagram-removes-photo-gay-newlyweds-kissing030714 reportedly removed a photograph of a gay couple kissing at their wedding] as "inappropriate".
; some sexual content
: Instagram's removal of sexual content has been criticised as [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/30/instagram-s-sex-censorship-is-inconsistent-and-hilarious.html being inconsistently enforced].
; menstrual blood

=== No license metadata ===
Unlike [[Flickr]] (and your own site if you so choose!), there's no metadata for marking photos or indeed whole photostreams as licensed under Creative Commons licenses.

[http://i-am-cc.org/ i-am-cc.org] lets you choose a CC license for your Instagram photographs, but you have to log into the service every three months to 'renew' the license grant.

=== feed not showing all content ===
Instagram is not showing all photos by those you follow, but at least in some cases only some subset: https://twitter.com/danrubin/status/968507814544052224

==Downtime==
==== 2018-07-13 Outage ====
Around 12pm Pacific on 2018-07-13, Instagram was unavailable. The iOS app shows an error notification when visiting your home timeline or profile page "Couldn't refresh feed", and visiting the "discover" tab shows "We're sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again." On the website, a generic "5xx Server Error" message was displayed.

** "“It's amazing how productive doing nothing can be.” — Jeff Bridges as #KevinFlynn<br>Original photos at tantek.com/t50B1<br>.<br>Set a #sunrise PR #running to the top of #MtTam today (#Thursday), 84:41 #ascent, cutting nearly 4 minutes from my previous #record set six months ago. Thanks to a #beautiful day, chasing speedy pal Hannah, and taking time-off to heal from an injury 33 days prior.<br>.<br>That rainy Friday I #ran up #Tam twice (while pal Bryan was doing 3x), hit my head on a tree on the first descent, injured my right thigh on a hard fall onto slippery solid rock on the second. (See previous photos post here on IG, smiles despite rain and falling, because I’d just run up&down a mountain, twice)<br>.<br>Took the weekend to recover, went to the doctor Monday, no concussion (or any symptoms of head injury, somehow no head bruise either), no leg break, just tissue damage. Ran a mile the next day, that night my right knee turned purple and swelled up, apparenty from my internal thigh bruise liquifying and leaking downward. Stopped running after that.<br>.<br>Started waking up every night from knee pain, struggling to get back to sleep.<br>.<br>Three weeks without running, part of it at a yoga retreat, doing yoga twice a day, and plenty of nothing too. On the second night of the retreat the overnight knee pain stopped. Tried a short trail scamper down & up the next day, felt fine.<br>.<br>Gradually increased my #trail running distance and altitude until returning to Tam this morning for the first time since injury. Felt strong so I pushed hard and finally shattered a six month old PR.<br>.<br>#MountTam #Marin #trails #trailrun #run #TemelpaTrail #MtTamEastPeak #50ktraining #restandrecover #befierce #pushyourself #getup #facethemountain #fitstrongfierce #workharddreambigdocoolshit #latergram #nofilter #trailthursday #PRThursday<br>.<br>Original photos (full width/height) at tantek.com/t50B1" [https://tantek.com/ @Tantek Çelik] April 26, 2019
