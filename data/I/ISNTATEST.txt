'''<dfn>ISNTATEST</dfn>''' is a proposed Indieweb [[The_Social_Network|Social Network]] Trailer Acid Test from Examples Shown in the Trailer.

== Brainstorming ==
From [[The_Social_Network#Features_shown]]:

* [[photo]] post
* [[reply|Comment]] link/[[webaction]] in context of a post
* [[RSVP]] yes post
* [[Add as Friend]] button/[[webaction]]
* [[create]] UI text field with options to attach [[photo]], [[video]], [[event]] (possibly date?), [[location]]
* [[like|Like]] link/[[webaction]] in context of a post
* [[likes]] summary in context of a post
* [[relationship-status]] display and update
* [[Confirm]] and [[Ignore]] buttons (presumably in response to a [[friend]] request)
* [[note]] (brief, plain text) post creating on someone's [[wall]] ("Where are you?")
* [[note]] (status update) post creating "This day sucks!"

=== To Be Defined ===
The following features have yet to be prototyped / implemented / defined and would need to be (what building blocks?) before a test could properly be designed:

* [[Add as Friend]]
* [[relationship-status]] updating
* [[Confirm]] and [[Ignore]] buttons
* posting a [[note]] on someone else's "wall"
