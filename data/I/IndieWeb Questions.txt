'''<dfn>IndieWeb Questions</dfn>''' are commonly asked basic questions about the who, what, why, when, and where of the IndieWeb and the surrounding community and philosophies.

Often it may be difficult for new people to the community to know where to start--hopefully this page will give a quick, basic overview along with some good links to provide jumping-off points for learning more.


== Who ==
{{main|people}}
The IndieWeb community is comprised of a [[diversity|diverse]] and [[inclusivity_statement|inclusive]] group of welcoming [[people]] who all agree to a [[code of conduct]].

While some people may use IndieWeb [[principles]] for [[IndieWeb_for_business|business]] [[use case]]s and some corporations may build and offer [[friendly|IndieWeb friendly]] products and services, the core of the community is created both by and for people.

== What ==
{{main|what}}
{{main|indieweb}}

The [[indieweb|IndieWeb]] is about owning your domain and using it as your primary [[identity]] online where you [[POSSE|publish on your own site]] (and optionally [[syndicate]] elsewhere) to [[ownyourdata|own your data]].
* You can have more than one such [[personal domain]].
* You could use your own domain for purely a ''professional'' identity facet, preferring to keep anything personal off the internet/web. That's totally fine.


== Why ==
{{main|why}}

There are '''many reasons why''' you should use the IndieWeb, from controlling your experience on the web (instead of corporate algorithms) to deciding how, where, and when to post your content and where it goes.


== How ==
{{main|principles}}
{{main|how}}

The IndieWeb community creates and advances itself based on a handful of useful guiding [[principles]].

How (or how to or how do I) is the next question after first asking [[why]]; why should I IndieWeb, or why should I adopt, use, do, or create any particular IndieWeb feature or [[building block]], once clear, this leads to how can I IndieWeb, or how can I adopt, use, do, or create a particular IndieWeb thing.

== When ==
{{main|when}}  

People in the IndieWeb community are actively participating almost every hour of the day around the world in a variety of places and spaces.

There are a number of specific in-person and other related [[Events]] including [[IndieWebCamps]] and regular [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups. (See below.)

You can [[Getting_Started|begin]] right now by [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ joining us in the chat].


== Where ==
Naturally we're all actively participating in the IndieWeb from our own [[website|personal websites]]! 

However, for ease-of-use and communication while we build and improve them, the community gathers together around two primary centralized resources:

* the '''IndieWeb wiki''', which you're reading now;

* our '''online [[discuss|chat]]''', which can be accessed by a variety of methods so you can choose your favorite including: [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ online], via [https://indiewebcamp.slack.com/ Slack] ([https://chat.indieweb.org/slack sign up here]), [[IRC]], Matrix, and Discord
** Chat is centered around a small number of specific [[discuss#Join_Discussions|discussions]], but if you're not sure which one is best feel free to ask in any one of them and someone will help you find the best place to ask your questions, find help, or improve your personal website.
** Why not email? We don't utilize email as a primary means of communication for [http://microformats.org/wiki/wiki-better-than-email many reasons].

In addition to the online components of the community there are two ongoing in-person sets of events where the IndieWeb community regularly meets in-person:
* '''[[IndieWebCamps|IndieWebCamp]]''' is a 2-day creator camp and ongoing community (e.g. on [[discuss|chat]]) focused on growing the independent web or "indieweb" for short.
** [[IndieWebCamps/Attending|What to expect when attending an IndieWebCamp]]

* '''[[Homebrew Website Club]]''' is a growing world-wide network of meetups for everyone who wants to take back their web experience from social media silos, and own their online identities & content, or just want support with blogging!
