== History and description ==
ISBN numbers began use in 1970. Numbers assigned after 2007-01-01 are 13 digits long and known as ISBN-13 while those prior to that date are 10 digits long and known as ISBN-10. Different ISBNs are assigned to each edition and substantial variation of printed books, e-books, and even audio books (except for reprintings when there are no substantive changes) thus a hardback, paperback, .pdf, .mobi (e-book), and .epub (e-book) of the same book should all have different ISBNs.

ISBN-13 numbers are comprised of 5 groups of digits each typically separated by a dash. They indicate, respectively from left to right: Bookland Country Code, Group, Publisher, the specific title, and a check digit.
