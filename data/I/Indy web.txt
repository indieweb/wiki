'''<dfn>Indy web</dfn>''' is usually a misspelling of [[IndieWeb]], but may refer to personal site features that make use of aesthetics from the Indiana Jones (AKA Indy) movies such as [[map]] animations, or a web of Indiana Jones fan sites which link to each other, or unlikely to mean a spider web encountered by Indy in one of the movies.

=== Jeremy Keith ===
{{adactio}}’s monthly [[archive]] pages show travel maps for the locations he’s been that can animate (with soundtrack!) in the theme of the maps shown in Indiana Jones movies when he flies from city to city.
