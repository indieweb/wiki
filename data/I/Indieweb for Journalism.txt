'''<dfn>Indieweb for Journalism</dfn>''' is the application of Indieweb [[principles]] to one's personal site with a particular emphasis on use cases for journalists, photographers, editors, related bloggers and platforms which are publishing their work.

While the general [[principles]] of Indieweb can apply to anyone's site, in an attempt to help foster the next [[generations|generation]] of potential Indieweb adopters who may be focused on areas of news, journalism, or distribution, we're compiling some specific hints, tips, pointers, and examples which may be germane to these particular audiences to assist in their motivation and adoption.

In addition to the material below, be sure to see [[getting started]], which is an excellent place to start for all people.


== Projects ==
Naturally any [[project]] could be used for journalism and related purposes, but the following either are geared toward them, or are heavily used by them and have a relatively rich ecosystem of additional functionality or plugins to expand their use specifically toward these areas. New users, particularly those of [[generations]] 2+ who may not be programmers/developers by nature may be advised to take a look at one or more of these for their base functionality.

=== WordPress ===
{{main|WordPress}}

[[WordPress]] is a commonly used CMS in general, but there is a large and engaged community of journalists, magazines, newspapers, and other outlets using it. There are also a variety of use-case specific plugins and functionality.

==== Plugins ====
The list below isn't specifically Indieweb related, but are plugins, some with an Indieweb flavor, which people interested in these areas may find useful.

{{WordPress}}

=== Known ===
{{main|Known}}

The [[Known]] CMS was built as an opensource Indieweb project from the ground up thus making it a convenient choice. See also: [[Getting Started with Known#Journalists]]

== Indieweb Examples ==
A group of journalists and related people integrating Indieweb principles into their websites:
* [http://dangillmor.com Dan Gillmor]
* [https://richardmacmanus.com/ Richard MacManus]
* [[User:Billbennett.co.nz|Bill Bennett]]
* {{chrisaldrich}} has both [[WordPress]] and [[Known]] installs
* {{addyourself}}

=== Others ===
People working in the space and at least tangentially knowledgeable or aware of Indieweb or practicing some of the principles in the wild:
* [http://buzzmachine.com Jeff Jarvis], professor and director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New Yorkâ€™s Graduate School of Journalism
* [http://pressthink.org Jay Rosen], professor of journalism at NYU [http://pressthink.org/2016/10/pressthinks-new-design-third-space/ 1]
* [http://aramzuckerscharff.com/ Aram Zucker-Scharff]
* [https://marinagerner.com/ Marina Gerner] (example in the wild) 
* [http://timharford.com/ Tim Harford] (example in the wild, practicing [[PESOS]])

People are heartily encouraged to look into the depth and breadth of other examples on the pages spanning the remainder of the wiki.

== IndieWeb Outlet Examples ==
Below are a list of magazines, newspapers, and other journalistic outlets that are actively practicing various portions of IndieWeb tools:
=== ColoradoBoulevard.net ===
[https://coloradoboulevard.net/ ColoradoBoulevard.net], a local newspaper for the Pasadena, CA and surrounding areas. 
* As of 2018-05-08 {{chrisaldrich}} added support for sending/recieving [[Webmention|webmentions]] as well as [[backfeed]] from Facebook. Backfeed from Twitter and the ability to receive and display [[read]] posts was added on [https://coloradoboulevard.net/12-cool-parks-in-pasadena/ 2018-05-29]. [https://boffosocko.com/2018/05/29/indieweb-ifying-coloradoboulevard-net/]
* Example of facepiling received webmentions including [[like|likes]] and [[read|reads]]

== Byline Examples ==
It's not always/often the case for outlets to provide links to authors' personal websites. Generally they're links within the company's [[CMS]] to a page that aggregates the author's work only for that publisher. Occasionally they will also include links to other social [[silo|silos]] like [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]]. In an ideal world, authors, even staff writers, should ask for and receive credit links to a website that they control.

Below are some examples of larger publications which are giving links from articles directly to the author's personal websites:
* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-lied-to-me-about-his-wealth-to-get-onto-the-forbes-400-here-are-the-tapes/2018/04/20/ac762b08-4287-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0fd2f5643b3c Washington Post] gives byline to [https://jonathangreenberg.com/ Jonathan Greenberg]


== Syndicating Work on the Internet ==
Just as many people in the social media world [[syndication|syndicate]] or [[Cross-posting|cross-post]] material from their own blogs to sites like Facebook and Twitter, there's no reason that journalists couldn't follow a similar model for their own work. Typically a writer will be able to reach far more people by publishing their work in the New York Times than on their own website, so in addition to earning money by giving it to the outlet, they should archive a copy on their own website for their personal [[portfolio]] as well as all the usual social media sites in addition.

=== POSSE ===
{{main|POSSE}}
POSSE is an abbreviation for '''Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere''', a content publishing model that starts with posting content on your own domain first, then syndicating out copies to 3rd party services with permashortlinks back to the original on your site.

==== Indieweb Examples ====
* {{dangillmor}} wrote a [http://dangillmor.com/2014/04/25/indie-web-important/ post on his own site] and syndicated it (presumably manually) to [http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/25/indiewebcamps_create_tools_for_a_new_internet.html Slate] on August 25, 2014. While there wasn't [[backfeed]] from the Slate article to the original article, the original article did have backfeed from social silos to it.

==== Examples in the Wild ====
* [https://www.quantamagazine.org Quanta Magazine]
** Some publishers expand their reach by syndicating articles written specifically for their own outlet to other outlets rather than simply syndicating to their own social media properties. Quanta has [https://www.quantamagazine.org/about/ syndication partners] that include Wired, The Atlantic, Scientific American, Nautilus, Spektrum, and Scribd. 
** This article: https://www.quantamagazine.org/dark-matter-recipe-calls-for-one-part-superfluid-20170613/ was syndicated to Wired: https://www.wired.com/story/this-dark-matter-theory-could-solve-a-celestial-conundrum/
** Sometimes the titles of the articles will change from one publication to another although the bulk of the article remains the same. [http://stream.boffosocko.com/2015/evolution-of-a-scientific-journal-article-title-from-nature-to notes]

=== PESOS ===
{{main|PESOS}}
PESOS is an acronym/abbreviation for '''Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site'''. It's a Syndication Model where publishing flow starts with posting to 3rd party services, then using some infrastructure (e.g. feeds, pingbacks, webhooks) to create an archive copy under your domain.

==== Indieweb Examples ====
* {{chrisaldrich}} published an [http://altplatform.org/2017/06/09/feed-reader-revolution/ article on AltPlatform.org] and [[PESOS]]ed it to his own site using [[PressForward]] so that anyone visiting his URL would automatically be redirected to the canonical version on AltPlatform. He also then further syndicated copies of the post on his personal site to other social silos with the ability to allow backfeed to his post. Compare the following:
** http://boffosocko.com/2017/06/09/%F0%9F%94%96-feed-reader-revolution-its-time-to-embrace-open-disrupt-social-media/ (which is a bookmark with some commentary pointing to my post) to
** http://boffosocko.com/2017/06/09/how-feed-readers-can-grow-market-share-and-take-over-social-media/ (which is an exact copy of my post, which only I can see on my backend, that redirects the viewer to the original on AltPlatform).

* {{addyourself}}

=== PASTA ===
{{main|PASTA}}
PASTA is an acronym/abbreviation for '''Publish Anywhere, Save To (private) Archive'' and may be a workflow that many journalists would execute to maintain a personal [[portfolio]] of all of their work. 

==== Indieweb Examples ====
* {{addyourself}}

==== Examples in the Wild ====
* [http://www.savemy.news/ Savemy.news] is a service that uses Twitter in combination with the Internet Archive and webcitation.org to help journalists create public archives of all their work.

== Annotations ==

== Archiving ==
{{main|archival copy}}
Many journalists may be using their site as a [[portfolio]] and as part of that having an additional archive (aka Archival copy) can be crucial if their outlet should fold or disappear from the internet.
