'''<dfn>[https://ifttt.com/ IFTTT]</dfn>''' ('''IF''' '''T'''his '''T'''hen '''T'''hat) is a service for connecting apps and services with automation.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members using IFTTT:
=== Jeremy Keith ===
{{adactio}} uses IFTTT to [[POSSE]] his blog [[posts]] from adactio.com to [[Facebook]]. [https://ifttt.com/search/query/feed+facebook Example recipes for this (and more).]

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses IFTTT to [[PESOS]] his [[Withings]] weight measurements to his website by using the IFTTT [https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks "Maker" channel] to convert the Withings measurements into [[Micropub]] requests.

=== fluffy ===
{{beesbuzz.biz}} uses IFTTT to [[POSSE]] posts to [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], and (selectively) [[Facebook]].

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} uses IFTTT for both [[POSSE]] and [[PESOS]] with a variety of silos. See additional details in the posts listed below:

__TOC__

== Issues ==
=== Non-trivial latency ===
IFTTT has a non-trivial latency due to being limited to the once every 15 minutes polling they do.

=== No custom request headers ===
IFTTT HTTP requests to other sites have no way of being configured to send custom request headers.

== Criticism ==
=== SPOF ===
Because IFTTT is fairly popular (perhaps the most popular such service on the web) and in use by numerous sites large and small, it is particularly big [[SPOF]] (single point of failure). The lack of open source implementation (which you could move to if it existed by deploying your own) also adds to the fragility that you introduce when you depend on IFTTT.

=== Removal of app.net ===
In 2016-03, IFTTT removed the [[App.net]] channel, breaking POSSE flows in the process.

=== Removal of Pinboard ===
On 2016-03-27, IFTTT emailed users of the [[Pinboard]] integration saying it will be disabled seven days later. The creator of Pinboard wrote a detailed summary of why he won't agree to the new Pinboard developer terms of service: https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt/

=== Removal of Twitter (portions) ===
Some time in 2016, IFTTT removed the functionality for several custom recipes that previously worked with Twitter. One of these, in particular, was the ability to auto-follow people who tweeted a particular hashtag.

== Alternatives ==
=== Self-hosted (open source) ===
* [http://nodered.org Node-RED], a lightweight and extensible [[Node.js]] application, uses regular files instead of a [[database]], marketed for the Internet of Things but supports social services. Bundled in [[Raspberry Pi]]'s Raspbian OS distribution
* [[huginn]], the most popular open source solution, written in [[Ruby]], requires [[MySQL]]
* [https://trigger-happy.eu/ Trigger Happy] ([https://github.com/foxmask/django-th GitHub repo]), written in [[Python]].
* [https://github.com/muesli/beehive Beehive], written in [[Go]].
