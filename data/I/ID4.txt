'''<dfn>ID4</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for the [[1990s|1996]] movie Independence Day, where alien invaders use existing global satellites to [[POSSE|distribute]] & coordinate a [[decentralized]] attack, while inexplicably depending on a [[silo|centralized]] mothership for the energy shields of the attacking ships; you might be looking for [[ID3]].
