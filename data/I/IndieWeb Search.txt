'''<dfn>IndieWeb Search</dfn>''' is a search engine that lets you find web pages and websites created by IndieWeb community members.

IndieWeb Search is available at [https://indieweb-search.jamesg.blog indieweb-search.jamesg.blog].

== Why ==

IndieWeb Search is designed to make it easy to find new personal websites to browse as well as find answers to common IndieWeb questions.

== Features ==

IndieWeb search supports:

* Finding web pages based on a query.
* Searching for a web page by URL or site.
* Returning rich snippets (also known as "featured snippets") for some queries.
* Returning h-cards for "what is [domain name]" queries.

The indexing algorithm reads microformats to help retrieve specific pieces of information from a page. But, microformats markup is not required for the indexer to successfully retrieve information about a page.

== Indexing ==

The role of the indexing algorithm is to find information about a site that can then be served by (or interpreted by) the search engine.

The main pieces of information the search engine indexes are:

* Headings from h1 to h6
* Meta description
* Title tag
* The contents of a page in HTML
* The contents of a page in text
* The URL of a page

Fallbacks are in place to ensure that attributes like meta descriptions and titles can be generated even if they are not specified on the page. This ensures that search results appear consistent and with the information visitors need to accurately assess whether the content behind a link may meet their needs.

All sites are given a 1,000 page crawl budget. Each page successfully indexed contributes towards this budget. Only HTML pages are indexed and pages that are likely to be tag pages are excluded. There are some tag pages in the index left over from previous indexes that will remain accessible to visitors.

This budget ensures that the crawler can cover a wide range of sites as resources are limited.

The indexer uses the user agent indieweb-search. You can block the indexer from indexing part or all of your site using directives in your robots.txt file.

== Development ==

IndieWeb Search is in active development. This project is led by {{jamesgoca}}. The code for the project is [https://github.com/capjamesg/indieweb-search publicly available on GitHub] and welcomes any contributors no matter their experience with search.

== Architecture ==

IndieWeb Search has three main components:

* The indexing algorithm, responsible for adding content into an Elasticsearch store.
* The Elasticsearch server, used to store documents. This server is what you would call the "search index."
* The web server through which visitors interact with the website.

The Elasticsearch server has a custom-written, minimal API that lets the web server (which is hosted on a different server), make queries. This API also lets the indexing algorithm add contents to the index.

=== Concurrency ===

IndieWeb Search makes use of the Python concurrency.futures library which makes it easy to run the indexing program in multiple threads. Before using concurrency.futures, the search engine only indexed content using one Python thread. This was slow and meant one could only index 5,000-10,000 documents per day.

Using concurrency, the indexer can index content from dozens of sites at the same time. The current rate of indexing is tens of thousands of documents per day.

==== Being kind to servers ====

A big obligation any search engine has is to ensure that the indexing process does not interfere with the usability of a site or cause the site to stop loading. This could be caused by an indexing algorithm trying to request too many pages at once.

Incentives are aligned to prevent against server abuse: if you request resources too fast, the host might block the indexer so you cannot index a site. Conversely, a site may be unable to respond to all of your requests, leading to a partially-complete index of a site and a potentially unhappy site owner.

== Questions and requests for help ==

There are a few questions that need to be reviewed in more depth:

* How do I ensure relevant pages come up when someone searches for their name? I want "jamesg.blog" or "Aaron Parecki" to return top pages on the site.
* How do I calculate PageRank without running out of memory. The search index will likely reach hundreds of thousands of documents. The current PageRank calculation algorithm requires all documents are in memory which is impractical at scale.
* How do I enable featured snippets / direct answers on other domains? jamesg.blog, microformats.org/wiki/, and indieweb.org are all granted access to render featured snippets. More work needs to be done to understand how this feature may help other sites.

Have any suggestions for the search engine or thoughts on the questions above? Message capjamesg in the IndieWeb IRC or make a [https://github.com/capjamesg/indieweb-search contribution on GitHub]. All contributions are welcome, from issues to pull requests.
