'''<dfn>Ticket Auth</dfn>''' is an extension to [[IndieAuth]] that enables a publisher to send authorization, known as a ticket, that can be redeemed for an access token. This allows both solicited and unsolicited invitations to fetch restricted resources.

__TOC__


== Summary ==

* Alice has choosen to share private things with Bob. 
* Bob advertises a ticket endpoint on his website.
* Alice sends a ticket to Bob's ticket endpoint, which he can redeem for a token to access Alice's private things.
* Bob's ticket endpoint receives a ticket, which he exchanges for a token at Alice's token endpoint.
* Bob can now access Alice's private things.

== Use-cases ==
Use-cases that inspired the development of this protocol:
* be able to fetch private posts from someone's feed
* don't rely on a "follow request" in order to do so
* ...

== Protocol ==

=== Step 1: Decide to issue an access token ===

Alice has choosen to share private things with Bob. 

This is in contrast to a mechanism of advertising the fact that there may be private/protected content at a URL by using something like a WWW-Authenticate header. By indicating there may be more to see at a URL, that itself is leaking information.

The decision to share could be triggered by Bob notifying Alice that he is following Alice, or it could be without any affirmative action on Bob's part. This isn't strictly necessary but may provide a better user experience for granting these tokens.

* TODO: Expand on methods of Bob notifying Alice could be a [[follow]] post, or some other protocol, but is not related to authentication or required.


==== Why not send the access token directly? ====

When you send a ticket, you are sending an unsolicited payload to the receiver. The ticket is not requested by the receiver, so you cannot guarantee they will be protecting it if they aren't expecting it. (It may be logged in intermediate proxy servers, written to log files on the server, etc.) If the receiver supports receiving tickets, then they will be explicitly requesting an access token by exchanging the ticket, so you can be more confident they will take measures to protect the access token. This way the access token is only delivered via an explicitly requested HTTPS connection to your server.

Additionally, given some IndieAuth servers don't support expiration of tokens, this could allow permanent access to protected data, which is not ideal.

=== Step 2: Issue an access token ===

Alice has decided to send an access token to Bob. (Either because Alice decided to out of the blue, or because Alice noticed Bob's follow notification.)

==== Create the IndieAuth ticket ====

Alice generates a short-lived ticket which will last approximately a minute at most. The reason for short-lived is that you are sending something unsolicited to someone and it is safer to send something short-lived and single use, and require action to retrieve the actual token.

* Feed URL = https://alice.example.com/private/
* Ticket = 32985723984723985792834
* Deliver to ticket endpoint of the subject: https://bob.example.org/

Alice makes a GET or HEAD request to discover the ticket endpoint of the subject, https://bob.example.org/, searching for an HTTP Link element or a HTML <link> element with the appropriate rel value, <code>ticket_endpoint</code>.

* https://auth.example.org/ticket

Alice makes a POST request to the ticket endpoint.

* <code>ticket</code> - a random string that can be redeemed for an access token
* <code>resource</code> - the access token will work at this URL
* <code>subject</code> - the access token should be used when acting on behalf of this URL

<pre>POST https://auth.example.org/ticket
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

ticket=32985723984723985792834
&resource=https://alice.example.com/private/
&subject=https://bob.example.org
</pre>

This is basically saying "if you wanted to fetch this feed as this person and see private stuff, here's a ticket you can use to get an access token".

==== Redeem the ticket for an access token ====

Bob's ticket endpoint redeems the ticket for an access token

The ticket endpoint makes a GET or HEAD request to discover the token endpoint of https://alice.example.com/private/, searching for an HTTP Link element or a HTML <link> element with the appropriate rel value, <code>token_endpoint</code>. 

The ticket endpoint makes a POST request to the token endpoint to exchange the ticket for an access token. The POST request contains the following parameters:

* <code>grant_type=ticket</code>
* <code>ticket</code> - The ticket to be redeemed

The IndieAuth spec does not currently address the issuance of resource-limited tokens. The discussion for that is at https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/82 

===== Example =====

<pre>POST https://alice.example.com/token
  Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Accept: application/json

  grant_type=ticket
  &ticket=32985723984723985792834
</pre>

Response is an access token as specified in the <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#access-token-response">IndieAuth Spec</a>.

=== Step 3: Use the access token ===

Now Bob's authorization endpoint has the remote access token that could be used to fetch Alice's feed.

How to get it to the reader or the webmention endpoint verifier is up to those implementations, it may be internal, or may use another spec to coordinate.

=== Notes ===

The current implementation expects that all pages that could be deemed as a <code>resource</code> would have the <code>rel=token_endpoint</code>

Advantages:
* The thing that gets tokens only needs one new public endpoint, the endpoint that receives tickets
** Sample code: https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/ae61731cc57a707b5076899d5c8371b1
* Issuing tickets is completely voluntary, and does not have to be prompted by an action by the eventual receiver of the token

== Token Issuing ==
How a website decides to issue tokens does not need to be defined by this spec.

{{aaronpk}} created an interface to be able to send tickets to arbitrary URLs, and shows the token info after the ticket has been redeemed.

[[File:aaronpk-ticket-admin.png]]

{{martijnvdven}} created a public interface on the [[token_endpoint]] where arbitrary [[homepage]] URLs can be given for anyone to receive a token.

== Open questions ==

*Would a token grant access to anything more specific than the provided resource, or would it be only for that specific resource? (e.g. should a token for <code>https://example.com/alice/</code> also work on <code>https://example.com/alice/feed</code>)
** Giving meaning to the URLs like this is convenient but may be misleading or break security boundaries in unexpected ways.
** An alternative would be to include another parameter, such as the previously discussed "realm", or somehow using scopes for this.
** Following [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2 RFC8707: Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0] this would mean allowing <code>resource=https://example.com/alice/</code> to be used to retrieve the value of <code>https://example.com/alice/feed</code>
*** This allows the use of multiple <code>resource</code> parameters for the purpose of multiple resource URLs to provide access to

*Any provision for providing an expiry time as part of the granted ticket?
** What would the use case be? Just like OAuth authorization codes, these are extremely short lived and there is no recourse if they expire other than starting over
*** {{jamietanna}} wonders if this is more about allowing the granted token to expire? That should be clear when redeeming the ticket and receiving an <code>expires_in</code> in the response from the token endpoint, and the optional presence of a <code>refresh_token</code>

* Should it be assumed that the ticket endpoint will automatically redeem all tokens? It's technically an implementation detail, not a requirement of the spec, but witht he amount of time the ticket is valid, this seems a good move. Assuming the token endpoint supports revokation.

* Where does the ticket endpoint go looking for the token endpoint? Currently the only thing it is sent that it can act on is the <code>resource</code> value. If that is also supposed to function as sort of a root URL of resources it gives access to, is it correct to assume the token endpoint can be discovered at that exact URL? (See first open Q.)
** {{martijnvdven}} ended up setting the resource as their root domain, which made it impossible to go get a token with the token endpoint only discoverable from the /martijn/ path. This was because of the assumption that <code>resource</code> was like <code>realm</code> in that it could be anything, but that stopped the ticket endpoint {{GWG}} was writing from ever redeeming. [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-07-04#t1625434428477500 Short discussion in chat.]
** Something that can be fixed by providing a specific <code>iss</code>/<code>issuer</code> value along with the <code>resource</code> in the POST to the ticket endpoint?
*** {{jamietanna}} was wondering about the <code>iss</code> matching the issuer of the token (i.e. the IndieAuth server's URL) but agrees with {{zegnat}}'s point about it being in the initial POST to the ticket endpoint, and matching the identity URL of the user who is providing access
** It was pointed out that by putiting the token endpoint header on a resource URL, you may be indicating there is something there. For example, you choose to have your private pages return 404. Then how does the ticket endpoint discover the token endpoint? As above, it should return a <code>me</code>/<code>iss</code>/<code>issuer</code> parameter

* Should we make it clear that multiple <code>resource</code>s could be granted from a single ticket? Following RFC8707 would make it possible to do so
** {{jamietanna}}'s receiver supports <code>resource</code> and <code>resource[]</code>

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Martijn van der Ven ===

As of 2021-07-04 (at [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-07-04/1625433752084900 21:22 UTC]), {{martijnvdven}} has a token endpoint with the ability for anyone to request a ticket. It is accessible through https://vanderven.se/martijn/token/.

Please treat the whole thing as experimental, and feel free to test your own endpoints against it!

Tokens created through there are meant for the entire domain (the <code>resource</code> is <code><nowiki>https://vanderven.se/</nowiki></code>) and have no <code>scope</code> set. They are purely to identify someone as their URL. Because of the experimental phase of this spec, tokens are kept to short life times (3 days).

* '''Special:''' while requesting tickets is declared out-of-scope for this extension, the way it is implemented here follows the pattern from [[IndieAuth]]’s [https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#token-revocation Token Revocation]. A <code>POST</code> with <code>action=ticket</code> triggers the sending of a ticket.

=== David Shanske === 

As of 2021-07-04, {{gwg}} has a proof of concept ticket endpoint on his test site that can receive tickets and redeem the associated token and store it. It does not yet utilize it for anything or have an interface to do so.

=== Jamie Tanna ===

As of 2021-07-07, {{jamietanna}} has created a POC ticket endpoint which is [https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/ticket-auth-poc Open Source] and [https://indieauth-ticket-auth-poc.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku] for anyone else to use it.

This implementation requires an <code>issuer</code> to reference the profile URL of the user who's <code>token_endpoint</code> is to be used for the ticket exchange.

This returns the token exchange body to the caller, and logs some information, but not the granted access token (currently), nor does it store it.

It does not yet utilize it for anything or have an interface to do so.

Jamie is currently using this on [https://www.staging.jvt.me/ his testing identity].
