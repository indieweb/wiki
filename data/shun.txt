{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Shun</dfn>''' is a custom module added to the [http://twit.tv TWiT] IRC server to allow a moderator to [[mute]] a user to the group but not have any indication of the silence for that user.

Shunning allows the moderators to prevent a troll's output from getting to the main channel but not let them know they have been shunned - from their viewpoint everything is normal.
