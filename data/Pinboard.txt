== Issues ==

=== POSSE ===
It does not seem possible to obtain the Bookmark ID as a return value when adding a bookmark via the [https://pinboard.in/api/ API]. This means it isn't possible to add a [https://indiewebcamp.com/posts-elsewhere#Suggested_Markup u-syndication] link to the syndicated copy on the original post.
