{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Persona</dfn>''' is a protocol for [[email]]-based identity spearheaded by [[Mozilla]] that is supported by [[IndieAuth]] for [[rel-me]] links to email addresses; it will be shutting down November 30, 2016 [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers].

See http://browserid.org/

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of IndieWeb sites which act as their own Persona provider, without relying on delegation to another email provider, or to the Mozilla default provider.
* ... add yourself

Examples of IndieWeb sites which consume (allow login via) Persona in particular (beyond using IndieAuth to do so).
* [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris.org]] - although people other than me don't really get to do much other than enjoy the fact that it says "You are signed in as {your email}".

== Shutdowns ==
The following sites used to provide or accept (consume) Persona logins but no longer do. Most recent first:
* 2014-06-10 '''orchestrate.io''' is phasing out Persona login. The next time you sign in they require you to set a password.[http://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/06/10/userauth/]

== Criticisms ==
=== Reliance on JavaScript ===
Persona/browserid [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona/The_implementor_s_guide/Supporting_users_without_JavaScript relies on JavaScript] to work, forcing consumers to implement separate authentication functionality to support all users (e.g. users without [[JavaScript]] or when it fails to load).
