Site changes happen when you use a 3rd party service that changes in some way from the original service you signed up for. These changes can be related to user experience design, data storage and recovery, the ability to post privately, or how your data is used and sold.

When you don't own your own site or your data, you are dependent upon a 3rd party site. That 3rd party site can change rules, page layout or services at any time without your consent. [[site-deaths|Site Deaths]] are one another reason why you should own your own identity and content on the web.

= Site Changes =

This is a chronology of content hosting sites that have changed their terms of service, privacy policy, or user interface in ways that have significantly changed the people use their site. This specifically for content hosting sites that permit end-user posting. For each example, include site links, citations and dates where possible. Also include the social or user impact the change has had on people using the site.
