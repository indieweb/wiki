HTML is your data

* Use cases for web data
* What HTML can we use for them
* What are the issues we run into?

'''Use-case''': Feeds (what used to be RSS)
* HTML: h-entry (individual posts, home pages as feeds)
** Issue: last-modified. with RSS/Atom you can send if-modified-since and get back a 304 with no body, and not have to parse, or do any other tests

'''Use-case''': authentication discovery
* RelMeAuth / IndieAuth rel-me to an OAuth provider profile URL
** Issue: providers dropping rel-me support (FB), or wrapping with their own URLs (Twitter tco)

'''Use-case''': Read-it-later -> Pocket / Instapaper / Readability
* HTML: hAtom / hNews - consumed by Readability
** http://www.readability.com/developers/guidelines

'''Use-case''': social-graph - identity clustering
* rel-me symmetric link graph - supported by identengine.com (consumes)

'''Use-case''': n-factor-auth
* RelMeAuth with requiring multiple OAuth providers

'''Use-case''': home page security (Aside: HTTPS vs HTTP)
* https on your personal domain - WillNorris.com does this, is all https
** SSL with SNI (extension to TLS which allows the client to specify which hostname they're trying to connect to, so the server can provide a certificate custom to that hostname). This is the only way we're going to have tons of secure personal sites on shared hosting (same IP address).
*** cheap web hosting is typically shared hosting (share IP address with strangers)
*** or you host multiple people on your domain, e.g. given.familyname.org
*** issue: SNI doesn't work on <= IE8 or IE9/XP. Need IE9+ not on XP.
*** issue: lack of support in client libraries, e.g. Haskell library only recently added support for SNI. Janrain hasn't updated their Haskell library yet. So can't log-in using any Janrain OpenID service.
* support document for Persona has to be on https

'''Use-case''': scientific paper citations
* h-cite: http://microformats.org/wiki/h-cite

'''Use-case''': streams of physical measurement data from new devices
* trend: accept a REST API, and provide JSON
* opportunity: this is how you should be providing a stream of data from devices
* microformats2 library available for converting HTML with microformats to canonical JSON representation
** https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2


Question:
* How to return JSON version of your web page?
** Example: add ".json" to any URL on aaronparecki.com
* What about HTTP ACCEPT header? application/json - CONNEG
**Do both?

'''Use-case''': email address based discovery
* from alice@example.com ->
* WF: example.com/.well-known/webfinger/?resource=acct:alice@example.com
** that returns JSON
*** what does this tell you?
*** rel=feed - URL
*** rel=openid.server - URL
** but it could return HTML+microformats
* could eliminate with:
** just put the rel values on example.com
* could eliminate the well known URI with a new rel value
** rel="rels" href="rels.html"
*** rels.html has all the same rel/URL pairs as your WebFinger JSON

'''Use-case''': backups from web applications

'''Use-case''': exports from web sites/silos/application
Examples:
* Google Takeout - G+ export has HTML+microformats
* Facebook export has HTML+microformats
* Twitter archive has JSON that it renders clientside HTML+microformats

'''Use-case''': import an export into your own site
* i.e. transitioning from sharecropping to owningyourdata

'''Use-case''': outlines
* HTML: XOXO

'''Use-case''': rating information
* HTML: h-review

'''Use-case''': self-tracking
* http://aaronparecki.com/presentations/2013/06/19/1/low-friction-personal-data-collection
** has markup examples of his own self-tracking data
** sleep example: http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2013/06/22/061515/
** sleep example: http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2013/06/22/061515/.json

'''Use-case''': one endpoint for robot clients and human clients
* ACCEPT: mime multipart
** what would a browser do if you sent it a MIME multipart response?

General Issues
* Built-in HTML+microformats2 parsing?
** '''PHP''' - use [https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2 php-mf2] library
** '''Ruby''' - use [https://github.com/G5/microformats2 microformats2 gem]
** '''Node/JS''' - [http://microformat2-node.jit.su microformats.node][https://github.com/glennjones/microformat-node on GitHub]
** '''Python''' - [http://bleeds.info Randall Leeds] - volunteers to write one!

* Parsing speed at scale of HTML data
** use a proxy like pin13.net

* "But what if I don't want to display the data on my web page?"
