This app logs locations and step counts from an iOS 7 device, and sends it periodically via a POST request to a URL you define.

A simple backend for this should accomplish the following:

* Store the location and timestamp (and any other associated values like accuracy and speed)
* Query by timestamp
* Query by date range
* Query by location
* Location data should be returned with: latitude, longitude, timezone, locality, region and country

Looking up the timezone for a location is relatively easy. See [https://github.com/Esri/Terraformer/tree/master/examples/timezone the timezone example of Terraformer] for a Node.js implementation, and [https://github.com/aaronpk/Timezone-API a PHP implementation].

Unfortunately, building a reverse geocoder to convert latitude/longitude to a city/state/country is not trivial. It is definitely possible to run your own service for this. See [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Installation OpenStreeMap's Nominatim]. There are also a number of services available for doing reverse geocode queries, all with slightly different TOS and pricing.

=== Authentication ===

Currently only token-based authentication is possible by including a token in the config URL. rknLA is working on adding HMAC auth to the app so that if there is a secret provided in the setup URL, it will sign the requests so it can be verified on the server without requiring HTTPS.

Pull request adding HMAC support: https://github.com/esripdx/Offline-Logger-iOS/pull/2
