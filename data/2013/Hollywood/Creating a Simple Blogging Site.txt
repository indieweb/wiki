Where to start? Any docs on what people here have done?

* [[language]] - scripting language, static files
* [[flat file]] vs [[database]]
* [[posting interface]] - file upload, static site build, live-editing like wordpress
* [[Twitter]] - {{aaronpk}}, {{tantek}}, {{benwerd}}: all [[create]] content on own sites, no longer create content on twitter
* long form or short form content first? right now it's more fun to work on the short form posts because they are easier to create and easier to [[interact]] with other peoples' short notes
