Currently publishing flights at http://aaronparecki.com/travel, and within a couple days of making this page live, I've already had to move a flight, and cancel two flights. Now the challenge is how to represent changed/deleted flights.

Trips

The next step after sharing individual flights is to share an entire trip itinerary. This would include flights to and from the destination, hotel reservations, events and presentations, and possibly even notes and photos posted during the trip.
