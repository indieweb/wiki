What are good patterns for a composite feed of multiple post types?

Challenges:
* how to interleave different post types
* [[2013/Hollywood/Pagination|pagination]] 
* when one post type (e.g. [[notes]]) overwhelms and causes all other post types to scroll off the bottom
** specifically not seeing any articles or photos (or videos - another person) among a stream of notes
*** possible solution: maybe have a sidebar module with 3 most recent [[articles]]
** [[2013/Hollywood/Pinning_Posts|pinned posts]] (of any type) - just one
*** pin most recent article (shane)
* differentiating top / most recent post with larger type
** "commit to it" needs to be larger enough to really call that out
*** Tantek needs to increase the type size of the top note when it's the most recent post - to be as big as tweet permalinks are by default as compared to stream notes
