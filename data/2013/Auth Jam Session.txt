= Indie Auth Jam =

== Agenda ==
* Any problems with IndieAuth and your site?
** Rob Lord: having problems with IndieAuth as of 2013-06-22 - couldn't log into IndieWebCamp. Possible cause: rel="me nofollow" or rel="nofollow me" found in twitter.com/r0bl0rd and github.com/r0bl0rd Fixed. HTTP vs HTTPS err.
* IndieAuth recent changes:
** enforced http / https consistency
** if your auth provider redirects to an https profile URL, you MUST directly link to the https version

== IndieAuth + Persona ==
* https://etherpad.mozilla.org/user-research-auth-questions
* add: rel="me" href="mailto:foo@bar.com"
* Can we extend IndieAuth for people who don't have a domain
** Use Webfinger (optional) to detect when people are delegating authority accidentally to wrong email
* Perhaps restrict it to rel="me" href="mailto:you@yourdomain.com" on yourdomain.com
** On second thought, this is a bad idea... too heavy burden for security to individuals

== IndieAuth + Persona + WebFinger ==
* rel-me to an email
* email is authenticated with Persona with verification with requiredEmail
* final check is WebFinger discovery on the email address to make sure it links back to the original home page

== IndieAuth + SMS ==
* rel="tel:..."
* IndieAuth server sends a one-time txt to your phone number that you have to enter into the IndieAuth web form flos
* SMS uri scheme defined in RFC 5724: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5724.txt
** supported on Apple Mobile Safari to launch Messages app:
** http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Articles/sms.html
* TEL URI scheme defined in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3966


Example: 
Adding something like this to your site should enable SMS authentication on IndiAuth.

<pre>
<a rel="me" href="sms:+15035555555">(503) 555-5555</a>
</pre>

How does the RelMeAuth flow work?

How do you consume IndieAuth?

== What about IndieAuth being a Persona IdP? ==
* Log in to a site with your email address, starts the IndieAuth process
