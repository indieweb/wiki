==== Personal Data Storage Solutions ====
How do you store personal data or historical records? Do you use Dropbox, Gmail or something else? 

For the last three years, @aaronpk and @caseorganic have been using a private install of Wordpress on their domains. Called "The Brain", the Brain accepts posts from email and turns the Subject-line of the post into tags so that information can be stored later. 

The Brain allows you to: 
*Store information like your vehicle or home history for easy access
*Store frequent flier miles in pages
*cc the brain on emails that you wish to store for later so you can easily get to them again, regardless of which email provider you use. For instance, you don't have to worry about Gmail dumping your emails or migrating your mail over to a new service if you change it. You also don't have to worry about paying a monthly fee for a service like Evernote, because everything is stored on your own Wordpress install on your own service. 
*No spam - you only allow certain email addresses to be able to send messages to someone's brain.
