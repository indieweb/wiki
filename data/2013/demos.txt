== Hack Day Demos ==
Day 2: 2013-06-23 - ~3 minute hack demos.

=== Brian Hendrickson ===
Brian Hendrickson - brianhendrickson.com demo

Using his TrueMVC (see yesterday session from the [[2013/Schedule]]) code/architecture - written in Javascript / Coffeescript.

Posts a comment - sends a webmention to Laurent's Post. Webmention didn't go thru.

Note: Github repo at the bottom of brianhendrickson.com

Posts a comment - sends a webmention to one of Sandeep's posts.

Implemented webmentions, then found out that [[Storytlr]] only supports receiving pingbacks.

Style playing with it. Work in progress. 

Node code, webmentions, pingbacks. All in there.

=== Brad Fitzpatrick and Brett Slatkin ===
Brad Fitzpatrick and Brett Slatkin - Web Fist

Emails from Facebook and Gmail to webfist.org

verify spec rel

webfist.org/.well-known/...

Recent changes on webfist.org - modtime, scrypted version of email address, sha1 of the blob that proves that you have the stuff

blob includes a proof URL

querying the proof URL also doing the scrypt thing - there's the raw original email with DKIM that Facebook signed.

=== Tantek Çelik ===
Tantek Çelik - tantek.com rel-syndication links and super simple reply-context

Add displaying of [[rel-syndication]] and [[rel-in-reply-to]] links to [[Falcon]].

E.g.  on http://tantek.com/ :

* http://tantek.com/2013/174/t4/view-conversation-rel-syndication-posse-indiewebcamp

Note the "View on Twitter" link in case you want to go favorite it or reply or otherwise look at it on twitter - marked up with [[rel-syndication]].

Then look at the previous post (left arrow nav)

* http://tantek.com/2013/174/t3/fitness-heartrate-faster-b2b-half-marathon-future

Note that "View Conversation on Twitter" because this post is a reply, which lets you see the whole conversation on Twitter because I haven't implemented that.

Then in about 7 minutes before the demo deadline, I implemented a super simple [[reply-context]] display there at the top that just says "In reply to" and links with [[rel-in-reply-to]] to the original post that my reply is a reply to.

=== Bret Comnes ===
Bret Comnes - indieweb comments using gh-pages - on Laurent's post, everything but the avatar pic - with manual [[webmention]]

=== Sean McGregor ===
* Sean McGregor - Personal Semantic APIs - using iframes to get fine-grained locally controlled access control. modify the experience of every site using greasemonkey scripts.

=== Jack Senechal and Augustin Bralley ===
* Jack Senechal and Augustin Bralley - Camlistore with Node.js and Raspberry Pi

=== Aaron Parecki ===
==== SMS login without password ====
Aaron Parecki - IndieAuth with SMS and Persona logins

Get the IndieAuth prompt screen

if you add the sms: rel-me link you get a link to use it

A text box shows up.

Enters 4 digit code from his phone.

Logged into IndieWebCamp.com

==== IndieAuth with email via Persona ====
Get the IndieAuth prompt screen

if you add the mailto: rel-me link you get a Persona login button

click it - go through the Persona login flow

and you're logged into IndieWebCamp again.

=== Aaron Parecki and Francois Marier ===
Aaron Parecki and Francois Marier - IndieAuth as an authentication provider for Persona logins.

Didn't have time to code it - but figured out what the flow needs to be and wrote up a spec https://github.com/fmarier/indieauth-personaidp-spec

As a user all you have to do is serve the support document on your email domain (your own personal email domain). Then you set indieauth.com as the authority for that domain.

Second you set a rel-me to your email address which if it's the same as your web domain you're done.

If your email domain is different from your web domain then you need to setup webfinger to connect the to.

Aaron will post his document on how to do so.

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
Ben Werdmuller - likes, working comments, syndication links

1. Fixed his IndieWeb comment presenting setup.

2. Added [[rel-syndication]] links to [[POSSE]] copies of posts. E.g. photos are linked to their [[Flickr]] and [[Facebook]] copies.

3. "Favorites". He's going to "like" a like on Sandeep's post. sandeep.io/83 except he prefers stars. Demonstrates Federated liking!
