== Hack Day Demos - Day 2 ==

=== Tantek ===
Tantek demonstrated using [[webactions]] with [[Twitter]]-specific fallbacks on his site to [[repost|retweet]] one of his [[notes]] from his site as the @indiewebcampuk account.
https://twitter.com/t/status/376729793813037057

=== Barnaby ===
Barnaby visits a post on tantek's site, sees a "reply" button which jumps to his own domain and replies to his post.
Demonstrated a seamless indieweb to indieweb reply flow.
http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4RwG2q/

=== Andy ===
Did some UX brainstorming and design for where [[web actions]] could go:
* Forking the conventions of the UI you’re syndication to adds extra cognitive load for users
* Clone the UI you’re trying to recreate
* Language difficulties — ambiguous verbs and nouns!
* Different verbs for different content types e.g. no-one retweets an article
* Could use referrer URL to pre-populate the action UI to the culture of that silo
* Could do referrer handling dynamically in JS on the clientside

=== Aral ===
Talked about concept of weaving indieweb content directly into the twitter.com UI by using original post discovery algorithms to detect POSSE copies, load full content directly into twitter. This doesn’t break the flow of reading twitter, making a more pleasant experience for everyone.

=== Amber ===
Is using p3k on her site caseorganic.com. Demonstrates logging into her site.
*goes to: http://caseorganic.com/notes
* if logged in shows an inline text box to post a note.
* Amber demonstrates posting a note, it shows up immediately on the /notes page.
* Also gets POSSE'd to Twitter.
* Notification shows up in IRC (due to IndieWeb reference).
* Never has to visit twitter again (phew!), has it covered via p3k and IRC.
* Don’t get a romanian domain name (.ro [[short domain]])!
* Short note posting UI links to “full” UI, which is far more complex, has ability to handle replies, RSVPs, original post discovery etc.

=== Boris ===
* Iterating on UI to publish things to his static blog.
* Menubar app on MacOS!
* Really easy to post to Twitter with apps, but hard on indieweb, command lines etc.
* He created a menubar app for ease of us.
* Has option to create a link blog post.
* Extracted the title from a link
* Can enter body text in Markdown
* get a local preview
* can iterate
* updated local preview
* Twitter and G+ checkboxes in popup window will POSSE to those.
* Demonstrated posting a link blog to IndieWebCamp.

=== Pelle  ===
(on twitter: @voxpelli)

* Continuing on the theme of enhancing static blog setups.
* Worked on how to receive and display webmentions.
* Building an endpoint which returns a JSON representation of webmentions receieved by a URL, to enable * creation of a Disqus-like tool for displaying indieweb comment on static sites.

=== Mime ===
@cuv82
* Set up a URL API for following someone — going to be the first consumer of <action do=follow>?
* Got webmentions mainly set up, a few bugs to work out. Seamless replying to other indie content through his feedreading interface.
* Total time to add Aaron to reader, comment on post within same UI: about 30 seconds.

=== Michal ===
@stefek99
* Problem: too many websites that he manages
* uses Google docs to track them all! (showed screenshot crops)
* implemented a live panel admin dashboard
* Lets him post common banners (or messages) to his multiple websites via a javascript embed.
* Demonstrated a banner promoting Mailpile's IndieGogo campaign showing up in one of his Tumblrs, and one of his Blogger blogs.

=== Sebastian ===
* Worked on a webmention implementation.
* Via curl was able to get a webmention from Aaronpk?

=== clarification about reply vs comment ===
Tantek clarified reply vs comment — a reply is something you post on your site, we call them comments when they’re shown on other people’s sites.

=== Brennan ===
Worked on indiewebify.me, a guide to building your indieweb identity. Today, implemented validation UIs for people to easily check whether or not their markup is shiny.
* Built validation UIs for rel values and h-card data, working on h-entry validation.

=== Aaron ===
Code demo
When people started implementing webmentions, they started working on microformats parsing. They ran into a dependency in the microformats parsing library.
* Aaron and Barnaby worked on eliminating the dependency (on a single function).
* Didn't quite finish it, but there are some test cases. 11 pass, 7 fail in current reimplementation.
* Goal/end result: single .php file for parsing microformats, drop-in microformats parser.
