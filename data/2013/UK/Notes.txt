Welcome to IndieWebCamp UK 2013!

Home: http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/UK
Schedule Grid: http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/UK/Schedule
Tagboard: http://tagboard.com/indiewebcamp

Create session specific Etherpads of the form /indiewebcamp-hashtag
Where "hashtag" is the hashtag for each session. If one already exists, put it under a “Past sessions about this topic” header and write your stuff at the top.

Please use mediawiki syntax as much as possible (instead of the “rich text” editor) to ease wiki dumping later.

Add URLs to sessions below per day:
