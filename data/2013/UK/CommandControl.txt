Big Idea: #CommandControl - dashboard for managing 10+ websites (Tumblrs, Bloggers) and major social media profiles.

Example usage:
* Today: IndieWebCamp, 
* Monday: ranting about  waking up to the office
* Week: promoting event, 
* Saturday: realtime updates from the concert

Potential solution:

* Bookmarklet / plugin / extenstion to edit avatar / timeline photo. (there might be no API for that)
* Linking to image that changes / URL that changes.

YEAH - some hacks would have to be included. Workflow - if we could find a way to automate the browser. Going in circles here, need some input from BlackHat community.

Naive authentication to edit .js containing the data: https://github.com/stefek99/naive-auth

Default credentials - not the best practice I know
