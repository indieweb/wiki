Welcome to the [[IndieWebCampUK 2013|2013/UK]] #[[indiemark]] discussion

Each step should have feedback for the user

Brennan - trying to look at this as a map -
* "IndieWeb" country level, high-level overview showing the benefits
* city level - easy first few steps

All "Level 0" steps of IndieMark should be easy to implement, especially "search" which you get for free if you don't "screw it up"

Anything that affects the UI of the site should be a suggestion.

Reach for level 1 rather than reach for level 0
* Demos of webactions in action:

POSSE - note that manual UI is ok

examples:
* https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons#tweet
* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share/

No dead ends - crawlable

e.g.

Suggestions for minimal navigation UI
* breadcrumb navigation
* list of all the posts
* linking to other post tags
* next/previous across posts

UI for searching your posts
* Level 1 suggestions: Search UI - any search purposes
* ok to use google search, example:
<pre>
<form action="http://www.google.com/search" method="get" class="search">
        <input type="text" name="q" placeholder="Search">
        <input type="submit" value="Search">
        <input type="hidden" name="as_sitesearch" value="aaronparecki.com"><!-- site search -->
        <input type="hidden" name="tbs" value="sbd:1,cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/1999"><!-- sort by date -->
</form>
</pre>
