Indie-IFTTT [http://ifttt.com]

Is there an open-source version of IFTTT?
* Huginn (https://github.com/cantino/huginn )
* Anki: http://ankisrs.net (spaced-repetition flashcards)

Issues with IFTTT
* people don't feel comfortable giving out passwords to all their accounts
** aaronpk only authorizes sites where the content is already public (RSS feeds, Foursquare, etc)

Good use case for OAuth to your email account 
* allow third-party apps to know # of messages in inbox, sent, but not their contents

http://identengine.com/ - gives you a rel-me based list of identities for someone

http://openfollow.net/ - same thing, from IWC 2012
