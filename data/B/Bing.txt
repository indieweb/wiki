{{section-stub}}
Bing Search has many typical web [[search]] engine features such

* image search
* featured snippets
And a few advanced features like
* date range search

=== Featured Snippets ===
Though initially named for showing a “snippet” of portion of a search result, Bing sometimes shows a generated snippet or other summary display, e.g. of calendar months.

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to add personal site search ===
Bing search URLs are of the form:
* <kbd><nowiki>https://www.bing.com/search?q=SEARCHTERM</nowiki></kbd>

A Bing site-specific search (e.g. for <samp>EXAMPLE.COM</samp> URLs) looks like this:
* <kbd><nowiki>https://www.bing.com/search?q=site%3AEXAMPLE.COM+SEARCHTERM</nowiki></kbd>

If you want to use Bing for your personal site search, you can add a form like this to your site:

<pre>
<search role="search">
 <form class="search" action="https://www.bing.com/search" method="get"><div>
 <input type="search" value="site:EXAMPLE.COM " name="q" style="max-width:15em"/>
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </div></form>
</search>
</pre>

be sure to replace <samp>EXAMPLE.COM</samp> with your domain name!

Optional: change the <code>max-width:15em</code> to whatever width you want by default for your search box.
