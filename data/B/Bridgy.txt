'''<dfn>[https://www.brid.gy/ Bridgy]</dfn>''' is an open source [[project]] and proxy that implements [[backfeed]] and [[POSSE]] as a service.  Bridgy sends [[webmentions]] for [[comments]], [[like]]s, etc. on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]], [[Instagram]], and [[Flickr]].

It can also [[POSSE]] posts, issues, comments/replies, retweets, likes/favorites/stars, and event RSVPs to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and [[GitHub]].

Finally, it adds [[webmention]] support to [[Blogger]], [[Tumblr]], [[WordPress#WordPress.com_hosting_service|WordPress.com]], and [[Medium]] blogs.

== How to use ==
Once you OAuth into Brid.gy, Bridgy polls your silo posts, discovers original post links, and sends comments to those links as webmentions.

It also serves the [[silo]] posts, comments, likes, etc. as [[microformats2]] for webmention targets to read.

Example silo-post-as-microformats for reference:
* [https://brid-gy.appspot.com/like/twitter/BarnabyWalters/443337312085495808/19090770 twitter favourite]

__TOC__

== Why ==
=== Backfeed ===
Bridgy is the fastest way to implement [[backfeed]] on your site.

Once you have [[webmention]] receiving support implemented on your indieweb site, OAuth into Bridgy and it will send webmentions to your posts for any activity on [[POSSE]]d copies of those posts.

=== Send silo interactions ===
After you sign up, Bridgy sends all responses to your posts back to your site and other sites that support webmentions. The recipients don't need to be signed up themselves; Bridgy sends webmentions to any server that supports them.

== Implementation details ==

[https://www.brid.gy/about More implementation details here.]

=== Generating h-cards from silo profiles ===
If your silo profile includes your web site URL, it's included in the h-card that Bridgy generates instead of your silo profile URL, which means that Bridgy comments rendered on original posts will (usually) link directly to your web site. As an example, see
the [https://snarfed.org/2014-03-01_indiewebcamp-sf-next-weekend#comments second and third comments here].

This is another step toward making individual web sites the real UX and using silos just as invisible infrastructure (pubsub, friend graphs, etc).

=== Custom Facebook [[original-post-discovery]] ===
Facebook supports POSSEing with [[POSSE_to_Facebook#See_Original|custom "See Original" links]]. Bridgy detects these and correctly sends comments and likes to the linked post.

=== [[posse-post-discovery]] on content with no backlinks ===
As of 2014-04-26, Bridgy uses posse-post-discovery to find original posts, even when the syndicated post does not or cannot include a permalink/citation. (as long as users publish rel-syndication links on their own site).

== History ==
[[User:snarfed.org|Ryan]] started working on Bridgy in the summer of 2011, [http://snarfed.org/2012-01-08_bridgy_launched launched the first (WordPress-only) version] on 2012-01-08, and [http://snarfed.org/2013-12-09_brid-gy-meet-webmentions relaunched it with webmention support] on 2013-12-09.

=== Previous Features ===
==== Publish Facebook Like ====
From ????-??-?? to 2015-02-14, Bridgy Publish supported POSSEing of [[like]] posts of [[Facebook]] posts, to "likes" directly on the Facebook posts themselves.

In a round of API changes, Facebook broke the ability to do this, and thus feature was disabled.[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/350]

This was the first ever regression of Bridgy Publish functionality, due directly to a change by a silo. There is no evidence to suggest this was a deliberately breaking change.[https://kylewm.com/2015/01/the-facebook-api-v2-0-is-hobbled-to-prevent-spammy]

== FAQ ==
=== How can I pay for Bridgy ===
'''Q:''' How can I ever return the favor of Bridgy? Or pay back for it?

'''A:'''
* [[open_collective|donate to the IndieWeb!]]
* file bugs: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues
* bump bugs you've filed that contributors haven't gotten to
* ideally even tackle fixing a bug yourself and submit a pull request!

=== Could Bridgy be decentralized ===
'''Q:''' Could Bridgy be decentralized / decentralised / distributed / federated ?

A: Yes, you can for yourself.
# Install Bridgy ([https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy open source]) on your own server. (It runs on [http://appengine.google.com/ App Engine], so you'd probably want to use that, but you could also use a compatible [[web_hosting#Platform_as_Service|PaaS]] like [http://www.appscale.com AppScale], or a LAMP server with compatibility libraries.)
# Configure it with Application API keys for the silos you want to backfeed from.
# There is no step three.

There are also other [[backfeed]] implementations.

=== What about links posted by others ===
'''Q:''' Does Bridgy send notifications for links to your site posted by others? E.g.
* https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/451165922418388992
is effectively a comment on:
* http://kartikprabhu.com/article/indieweb-love-blog
And it would be handy to receive it as such.

'''A:''' Yes! [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/456 Details.]

=== How do I recrawl my site ===
'''Q:''' How do I get Bridgy to recrawl my site, like if I’ve updated my [[h-feed]]?

'''A:''' Click a "retry" / "reload" button in the Responses list. 
# Go to your Bridgy for a particular silo, e.g. https://brid.gy/instagram/tantek
# Click the "retry" / "reload" button next to an item in the "Responses" list in the bottom half of the page

Note: If Bridgy has never found syndication link from your site to that specific silo, it may be more reluctant to recrawl your site.

=== How do I re-auth ===
'''Q:''' How do I re-auth Bridgy with various silos?

'''A:'''
# Go to https://brid.gy/ , click the silo you want to re-auth, and approve the prompts.
# Once you reach your Bridgy user page, if publish is disabled and you want to enable it, click the silo button next to it.

=== Can Bridgy re-send a batch of webmentions? ===
'''Q:''' Can Bridgy re-send a batch of webmentions?

'''A:''' Yes! Enter the original or silo post URL in the ''Resend for post'' box on your user page. Background in https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/579.
