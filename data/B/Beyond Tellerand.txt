'''<dfn>Beyond Tellerand</dfn>''' is (often abbreviated btconf) an annual web conference in Düsseldorf, Germany since 2011 (additional cities since), which has supported and helped sponsor the adjacent IndieWebCamp [[Düsseldorf]] annually since 2015.

Beyond Tellerand has a goal of looking a bit further, beyond the edge. See https://beyondtellerrand.com/about for more.
