{{emojicon|üî≤}}
'''<dfn>Building block icons</dfn>''' are used to quickly identify IndieWeb [[building blocks]] practices, features, and standards.

There are proposals to create a unified set of icons to represent IndieWeb concepts, [[formats]], and [[protocols]] that are common [[building blocks]].

== Use cases ==

Building block icons can be used to perform a number of functions, depending on context:

* '''Personal site owners''' can use icons to show support for IndieWeb formats (like: ‚ÄúI have a valid [[h-card]]‚Äù or ‚ÄúI support [[rel-me]]‚Äù)
* '''Creators of third party tools & [[projects]]''' can use icons to show support for building block standards like [[microformats2]], [[Micropub]], [[Webmention]], etc.
* '''Website user interfaces''' can use icons to provide information or context; for example to identify the origin of a comment being from a webmention, or ways to follow/subscribe such as [[h-feed]], [[RSS]], [[JSON Feed]]
* '''[[documentation|Documentation]], [[diagram]]s, and tutorials''' can use icons to identify formats and protocols used within workflows and user journeys
__TOC__
== Design goals ==

When creating icons to represent IndieWeb building blocks, its important that they:

* have a relationship to an [[logo|identity used for the wider movement]]
* share a common design language
* are unique, and don‚Äôt look like icons for other social web projects
* are simple, clear and can be used at multiple sizes

== Icons for IndieWeb concepts ==

At a session at [[2023/Nuremberg/block-icons|IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2023]], it was felt that all building blocks should be represented by icons to prevent the impression that you can only be part of the IndieWeb if you use certain protocols or formats.

==== 2023 proposal ====

{{paulrobertlloyd}} proposed a family of building block icons that could work alongside each other, that share a common ‚Äònode‚Äô motif (a line and a point) that appear in these icons in different ways.

The recommended colour for concept icons is {{Color sample|#FFB100}} <code>#FFB100</code> (see [[Indieweb color palette]]).

== Icons for Microformats ==

=== Icons in current usage ===

Microformats has an [http://microformats.org/wiki/spread-microformats established logo and branding], but currently no icons to represent the individual formats.

=== 2023 proposal ===

{{paulrobertlloyd}} proposed a set of icons that could work alongside the existing [[Microformats]] logo.

The recommended colour for Microformat icons is {{Color sample|#A3CC00}} <code>#A3CC00</code>.

== Feedback on 2023 proposals ==

{{paulrobertlloyd}} made an initial proposal for creating a family of icons for IndieWeb building blocks: https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2023/298/a1/indieweb_identity/, and documented them on this page.

Feedback on the 2023 proposals are being collected here. Please add or link to your feedback below.

<blockquote>I like this a lot. Enjoy IndieWebCamp!</blockquote> ‚Äì {{manton}}, [https://micro.blog/manton/25438202|25 October 2023]

<blockquote>Your proposal really honors the homegrown aspect of the current IndieWeb visual identity, including the existing language of each protocol. Each works great as a standalone icon, and together make a nice looking system.</blockquote> ‚Äì Nick Simson, [https://mastodon.social/@nsmsn@mastodon.design/111297433627353560|25 October 2023]

== Examples of usage ==
* {{paulrobertlloyd}} is using the proposed icons on a page on the [[Indiekit]] documentation site to demonstrate which protocols are supported: https://getindiekit.com/specifications
* {{manton}} is using the proposed icons on a page that explains [[Micro.blog]]‚Äôs support for different IndieWeb specs and building blocks: https://micro.blog/about/indieweb
