{{warn|In progress: page being written during IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2023}}

An <dfn>icon</dfn> can be used to quickly identify a concept. There are proposals to create a unified set of icons to represent indieweb the concepts, [[formats]] and [[protocols]] that make up the common [[building blocks]].

== Use cases ==

Building block icons can be used to perform a number of functions, depending on context:

* third party tools can use icons to show support for building block standards (for example [[mf2]], [[Micropub]], [[Webmention]])
* individuals can use icons to show support for indieweb formats (for example “I have a valid [[h-card]]”, “I support [[rel-me]]”)
* websites can be use icons in their interface (for example to identify the origin of a comment being from a webmention, or ways to follow/subscribe such as [[h-feed]], [[RSS]], [[JSON Feed]])
* tutorials, documentation and [[diagram|diagrams]] and can use icons to identify formats and protocols being referred to within workflows and user journeys

At a session at [[2023/Nuremberg/block-icons|IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2023]], it was felt that all building blocks should be represented by icons to prevent the impression that you can only be part of the indieweb if you use certain protocols or formats.

== Design goals ==

When creating icons to represent indieweb building blocks, its important that they:

* have a relationship to an [[logo|identity used for the wider movement]]
* share a common design language
* are unique, and don’t look like icons for other social web projects
* are simple, clear and can be used at multiple sizes

== Concept icons ==

==== 2023 proposal ====

{{paulrobertlloyd}} proposes a set of icons that could work alongside other icons for formats and protocols. All these icons share a common ‘node’ motif, that of a line and a point, that appears in these icons in different ways.

The recommended colour for concept icons is {{Color sample|#FFB100}} <code>#FFB100</code> (see [[indieweb color palette]]).

== Format icons ==

=== Microformats ===

==== Icons in current usage ====

Microformats has an [http://microformats.org/wiki/spread-microformats established logo and branding], but currently no icons to represent the individual formats.

==== 2023 proposal ====

{{paulrobertlloyd}} proposes a set of icons that could work alongside the existing [[Microformats]] logo.

The recommended colour for these icons is {{Color sample|#99CC33}} <code>#99CC33</code>.

==== 2023 proposal ====

{{paulrobertlloyd}} proposes a set of icons that could work alongside other icons for formats and protocols. All these icons share a common ‘node’ motif, that of a line and a point, that appears in these icons in different ways. IndieAuth would have an icon in this family.

The recommended colour for IndieAuth (and any related icons) is {{Color sample|#CC0066}} <code>#CC0066</code> (taken from https://indieauth.rocks).
