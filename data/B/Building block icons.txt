https://indieweb.org/Building_block_icons

An <dfn>icon</dfn> can be used to quickly identify a concept. There are proposals to create a unified set of icons to represent indieweb the concepts, [[formats]] and [[protocols]] that make up the common [[building blocks]].

== Use cases ==

Building block icons can be used to perform a number of functions, depending on context:

* third party tools can use icons to show support for building block standards (for example [[mf2]], [[Micropub]], [[Webmention]])
* individuals can use icons to show support for indieweb formats (for example “I have a valid [[h-card]]”, “I support [[rel-me]]”)
* websites can be use icons in their interface (for example to identify the origin of a comment being from a webmention, or ways to follow/subscribe such as [[h-feed]], [[RSS]], [[JSON Feed]])
* tutorials, documentation and [[diagram|diagrams]] and can use icons to identify formats and protocols being referred to within workflows and user journeys

== Design goals ==

When creating icons to represent indieweb building blocks, its important that they:

* have a relationship to an [[logo|identity used for the wider movement]]
* share a common design language
* are unique, and don’t look like icons for other social web projects
* are simple, clear and can be used at multiple sizes

== Icons for Indieweb concepts ==

At a session at [[2023/Nuremberg/block-icons|IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2023]], it was felt that all building blocks should be represented by icons to prevent the impression that you can only be part of the indieweb if you use certain protocols or formats.

==== 2023 proposal ====

{{paulrobertlloyd}} proposed a family of building block icons that could work alongside each other, that share a common ‘node’ motif (a line and a point) that appear in these icons in different ways.

The recommended colour for concept icons is {{Color sample|#FFB100}} <code>#FFB100</code> (see [[indieweb color palette]]).

== Icons for Indieweb formats ==

=== Microformats ===

==== Icons in current usage ====

Microformats has an [http://microformats.org/wiki/spread-microformats established logo and branding], but currently no icons to represent the individual formats.

==== 2023 proposal ====

{{paulrobertlloyd}} proposed a set of icons that could work alongside the existing [[Microformats]] logo.

The recommended colour for Microformat icons is {{Color sample|#99CC33}} <code>#99CC33</code>.

== Feedback on 2023 proposals ==

{{paulrobertlloyd}} made an initial proposal for creating a family of icons for indieweb building blocks: https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2023/298/a1/indieweb_identity/, and documented them on this page.

Feedback on the 2023 proposals are being collected here. Please add or link to your feedback below.

<blockquote>I like this a lot. Enjoy IndieWebCamp!</blockquote> – {{manton}}, [https://micro.blog/manton/25438202|25 October 2023]

<blockquote>Your proposal really honors the homegrown aspect of the current IndieWeb visual identity, including the existing language of each protocol. Each works great as a standalone icon, and together make a nice looking system.</blockquote> – Nick Simson, [https://mastodon.social/@nsmsn@mastodon.design/111297433627353560|25 October 2023]
