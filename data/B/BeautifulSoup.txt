<dfn>[http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ BeautifulSoup]</dfn> is an HTML parsing library for Python, often used by Python microformats parsing libraries, or as a [[link rel parser]] for [[follow your nose]] discovery algorithms.

BeautifulSoup4 leverages one of several possible HTML/XML parsing libraries (ElementTree, lxml, or html5lib) and provides a nice interface for wading through HTML, even very broken HTML (Earlier versions used complex regular expressions, instead of a "real" parser, to do this).
