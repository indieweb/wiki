'''<dfn>Cambridge</dfn>''' is a city in the greater Boston, Massachusetts (MA) area where [[IndieWebCamp]] events have been held (hosted at MIT), in [[2014/Cambridge|2014]], [[2015/Cambridge|2015]], and twice in 2016 ([[2016/MIT]], [[2016/MIT2]]).

'''<dfn>Boston</dfn>''' is one of the older cities in the US and as such the local geography is a little different with multiple cities (Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, plus the town of Brookline) making up the local area which may just be called “Boston” too. It can be a little confusing to visitors. 

The local area has been one of the W3C’s physical offices for a long time, previously at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL) Laboratory before moving to their own offices. 

The area is also home to a number of universities and colleges including Harvard, MIT, Northeastern University and Boston University. 

The area was also home to many of the early internet pioneers and the ARPANET network was managed from the offices of Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. who built and designed much of the infrastructure and hardware for the network.

It’s also home to a lot of [[open source]] developers and several organizations.
