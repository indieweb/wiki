'''<dfn>[http://bitlbee.org/ BitlBee]</dfn>''' is a communication gateway from [[IRC]] to other chat.

BitlBee natively supports the following IM networks/protocols: 
* XMPP/Jabber (including [[Google]] Talk)
* [[Microsoft]] MSN Messenger
* [[Yahoo!]] Messenger
* [[AOL]] AIM
* [[ICQ]]
* [[Twitter]] API 
** plus all other Twitter API compatible services like
*** [[identi.ca]] 
*** [[status.net]]
* [[HipChat]] 

It can also be built to support libpurple ( the library [[Pidgin]] uses ) to extend it's protocol support. There are also [https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins 3rd party additional modules for libpurple].

== Open bitlbee server for indieweb testing purposes ==

There is a publicly available Bitlbee server for community test purposed ( like webmention via instant messages ) at bitlbee.afterdose.org:6667 (SSL only). Server is operated by {{petermolnar}}; more information at [https://bitlbee.afterdose.org/ the server's readme page].

== Ideas ==
* Set up a Bitlbee to [[micropub]] protocol and you could post notes directly from chat. â€” {{gRegor}}
* Webmention notifications in bitlbee might be easy to set up, but maybe just direct IRC would be easier.

* [[IRC]]
