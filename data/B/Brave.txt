'''<dfn>Brave</dfn>''' is a web browser made by [https://brave.com Brave Software Inc] that by default blocks advertisement and allows the user to pay publishers. It's a free and open source browser with a decentralised ethos whereby users, advertisers and publishers exchange tokens through the [[Ethereum]] blockchain.

** "This warning is prompted by a company called Brave, who've been taking cryptocurrency donations "for me", using my name and photo, without my consent. I asked them not to, and to refund anyone who's donated; they said "we'll see what we can do" and that "refunds are impossible"." [http://www.tomscott.com @tomscott] December 21, 2018

Brave posted an update:

<blockquote>"Starting tomorrow, Brave Rewards will clearly indicate which publishers and creators have not yet joined Brave Rewards, so users can better control how they donate and tip.  This new message will appear in the regular donation process and in the tipping box. Moreover, creators that have not verified with Brave will no longer have their YouTube or Twitch channel images appear within Brave Rewards."</blockquote>
