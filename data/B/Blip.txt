'''<dfn>[http://blip.tv Blip]</dfn>''' (formerly '''blip.tv''') was a [[silo]] for hosting web [[video]] series. Blip was purchased by Maker Studios in 2013 and shut down by them on August 20, 2015.

== History ==
Originally Blip allowed anyone to upload videos, but as of 2013 the terms of service were updated to restrict use to "high quality, original episodic web series" and accounts that did not meet their criteria would be removed. The accounts were removed on November 7, 2013. [http://support.blip.tv/entries/23007795]

<blockquote>Videos that are not part of a high quality, original episodic web series can be removed at Blip’s sole discretion. Examples of content considered inconsistent with Blip’s definition of high quality, original episodic web series can include but are not limited to sermons, speeches, slide shows, webinars, screencasts, gameplay footage, tutorials, walkthroughs, meetings (corporate, community or government), personal (home movies, weddings, parties, vacations, etc.), music videos and content produced for other mediums (television, film, radio). Each episode must consist of original content created by the account holder.

{{gRegor}} used Blip.tv in 2010 to host a couple video podcast episodes. We never continued the series and learned in 2014 that our account had been removed due to the shift in their focus mentioned above. I never bothered to contact support as I'm sure the videos are gone.
