'''<dfn>[https://fed.brid.gy Bridgy Fed]</dfn>''' connects IndieWeb sites with [[Mastodon]] and the [[fediverse]]. You can think of it like a [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] service for those servers, except that it [[federation|federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Under the covers, it translates [[h-entry]]+[[Webmention]]s to/from [[ActivityPub]].

A developers-centric summary of Bridgy Fed:
* Bridgy Fed converts your existing site‚Äôs h-card profile, h-entry post permalinks, and Webmentions to ActivityPub, and vice versa.

== How it works ==
One key difference between Bridgy Fed and POSSE/PESOS is that Bridgy Fed [[federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Fediverse implementations like Mastodon understand that your profile and posts live on your site, not as copies under a separate Mastodon user, so they link to your site properly.

== Why ==
You want to federate your web site with the fediverse for the same reasons you [[POSSE]], [[PESOS]], or [[backfeed]] to any other silo: you want to own your data, but you also want to interact with people inside that silo.

== How to ==
See https://fed.brid.gy/docs for general information on how to setup Bridgy Fed.

=== How to add a follow form ===
Your Bridgy Fed dashboard page has a form for others put their fediverse profile URL or @-@ address to follow you.

You can extract this markup and put it on your own site too! 

People that have done this:
* {{aciccarello}} as of 2023-01-19 (See [https://www.ciccarello.me/subscribe/ /subscribe])
* {{tantek}} as of 2023-01-20 on his home page right column: https://tantek.com
* {{gRegor}} as of 2023-01-20 (See [https://gregorlove.com/follow/ /follow])
* {{jamietanna}} as of 2023-02-12 on his [https://www.jvt.me/subscribe/ /subscribe/ page]
* ...

Steps to make this work:
# Copy the form html from your site's profile on Bridgy Fed to somewhere on your site
# Change the URL for the form action to be an absolute URL:
#* <kbd><nowiki>https://fed.brid.gy/remote-follow</nowiki></kbd>
# Adjust classes, labels, and placeholders as desired

Here‚Äôs a summary of the HTML form. 
* replace <samp>@tantek.com@tantek.com</samp> with your @-@, and 
* replace <samp>tantek.com</samp> with your domain
<pre>
<form method="post" action="https://fed.brid.gy/remote-follow">
 <label for="follow-address">üêò Follow 
  <kbd>@tantek.com@tantek.com</kbd>:<br /> 
  enter your @-@ fediverse address:</label>
 <input id="follow-address" name="address" type="text" required="required"
        placeholder="@you@instance.social" alt="fediverse address" value="" />
 <input name="domain" type="hidden" value="tantek.com" />
 <input name="protocol" type="hidden" value="web" />
 <button type="submit">Follow</button>
</form>
</pre>

Sample rendering:

[[Image:2023-01-20-bf-at-at-follow-form.png]]

Entering a Mastodon @-@ address that you‚Äôre logged into (in this case <samp>@t@xoxo.zone</samp>) and clicking "Follow" will result in a screen like this:

[[Image:2023-01-20-mastodon-follow-prompt.png|487px]]

Clicking "FOLLOW" on that screen completes the follow action, and should show a success message like this:

Screenshot of a Mastodon view of a profile from Bridgy Fed, showing 0 posts, in stark contrast to how [[feed reader]]s immediately show all recent posts from a feed when you subscribe to a feed.

Screenshot of how an [[article]] post appears. Only the title and link is shown. The fed.brid.gy link under the title is a Mastodon oddity (see [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/391 GitHub issue]), but that URL redirects to the original post:
