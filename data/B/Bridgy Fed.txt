'''<dfn>[https://fed.brid.gy Bridgy Fed]</dfn>''' connects IndieWeb sites with federated social networks like [[Mastodon]] and [[HubZilla]]. You can think of it like a [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] service for those silos, except that it [[federation|federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Under the covers, it translates [[Webmention]]s to/from [[ActivityPub]] and [[OStatus]].

== Why ==

You want to federate your web site with a fedsocnet for the same reasons you [[POSSE]], [[PESOS]], or [[backfeed]] to any other silo: you want to own your data, but you also want to interact with people inside that silo.

== How it works ==

One key difference between Bridgy Fed and POSSE/PESOS is that it [[federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Fedsocnets like Mastodon understand that your profile and posts live on your site, not inside Mastodon, so they link to your site properly.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

Started using Bridgy Fed to federate with Mastodon and Hubzilla at the beginning of September 2017.


==== Federating a reply ====

Here's [https://snarfed.org/reply5.html an example reply to a post on Mastodon]:

And [https://mastodon.technology/@snarfed/3194674 here's how it shows up inside Mastodon]. Note that the permalink links back to snarfed.org, not inside Mastodon.
