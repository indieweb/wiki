'''<dfn>[https://fed.brid.gy Bridgy Fed]</dfn>''' connects IndieWeb sites with social networks like [[Mastodon]] and [[HubZilla]]. You can think of it like a [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] service for those servers, except that it [[federation|federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Under the covers, it translates [[h-entry]]+[[Webmention]]s to/from [[ActivityPub]] and [[OStatus]].

A developers-centric summary of Bridgy Fed:
* Bridgy Fed converts your existing site’s h-card profile, h-entry post permalinks, and Webmentions to ActivityPub.

== Why ==

You want to federate your web site with a fedsocnet for the same reasons you [[POSSE]], [[PESOS]], or [[backfeed]] to any other silo: you want to own your data, but you also want to interact with people inside that silo.

== How it works ==

One key difference between Bridgy Fed and POSSE/PESOS is that it [[federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Fedsocnets like Mastodon understand that your profile and posts live on your site, not inside Mastodon, so they link to your site properly.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Ryan Barrett ===

Started using Bridgy Fed to federate with Mastodon and Hubzilla at the beginning of September 2017.

And [https://mastodon.technology/@snarfed/3194674 here's how it shows up inside Mastodon]. Note that the permalink links back to snarfed.org, not inside Mastodon.

Screenshot of a Mastodon view of a profile from Bridgy Fed, showing 0 posts, in stark contrast to how [[feed reader]]s immediately show all recent posts from a feed when you subscribe to a feed.
