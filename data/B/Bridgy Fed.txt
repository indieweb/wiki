'''<dfn>[https://fed.brid.gy Bridgy Fed]</dfn>''' connects IndieWeb sites with [[Mastodon]] &amp; other [[fediverse]] instances, allowing those networks to follow your IndieWeb site, receive notifications of, read, and reply to your posts.

Bridgy Fed is like a [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] service for those servers, except that it [[federation|federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Under the covers, it translates [[h-entry]]+[[Webmention]]s to/from [[ActivityPub]].

A developers-centric summary of Bridgy Fed:
* Bridgy Fed converts your existing site’s h-card profile, h-entry post permalinks, and Webmentions to ActivityPub, and vice versa.

== How it works ==
One key difference between Bridgy Fed and POSSE/PESOS is that Bridgy Fed [[federates]] instead of [[syndication|syndicating]]. Fediverse implementations like Mastodon understand that your profile and posts live on your site, not as copies under a separate Mastodon user, so they link to your site properly.
__TOC__
== Why ==
You want to federate your web site with the fediverse for the same reasons you [[POSSE]], [[PESOS]], or [[backfeed]] to any other silo: you want to own your data, but you also want to interact with people inside that silo.

== How to ==
See https://fed.brid.gy/docs for general information on how to setup Bridgy Fed.

=== How to add a follow form ===
Your Bridgy Fed dashboard page has a form for others put their fediverse profile URL or @-@ address to follow you.

You can extract this markup and put it on your own site too! 

People that have done this:
* {{aciccarello}} as of 2023-01-19 (See [https://www.ciccarello.me/subscribe/ /subscribe])
* {{tantek}} as of 2023-01-20 on his home page right column: https://tantek.com
* {{gRegor}} as of 2023-01-20 (See [https://gregorlove.com/follow/ /follow])
* {{jamietanna}} as of 2023-02-12 on his [https://www.jvt.me/subscribe/ /subscribe/ page]
* ...

Steps to make this work:
# Copy the form html from your site's profile on Bridgy Fed to somewhere on your site
# Change the URL for the form action to be an absolute URL:
#* <kbd><nowiki>https://fed.brid.gy/remote-follow</nowiki></kbd>
# Adjust classes, labels, and placeholders as desired

Here’s a summary of the HTML form. 
* replace <samp>@tantek.com@tantek.com</samp> with your @-@, and 
* replace <samp>tantek.com</samp> with your domain
<pre>
<form method="post" action="https://fed.brid.gy/remote-follow">
 <label for="follow-address">🐘 Follow 
  <kbd>@tantek.com@tantek.com</kbd>:<br /> 
  enter your @-@ fediverse address:</label>
 <input id="follow-address" name="address" type="text" required="required"
        placeholder="@you@instance.social" alt="fediverse address" value="" />
 <input name="domain" type="hidden" value="tantek.com" />
 <input name="protocol" type="hidden" value="web" />
 <button type="submit">Follow</button>
</form>
</pre>

Sample rendering:

[[Image:2023-01-20-bf-at-at-follow-form.png]]

Entering a Mastodon @-@ address that you’re logged into (in this case <samp>@t@xoxo.zone</samp>) and clicking "Follow" will result in a screen like this:

[[Image:2023-01-20-mastodon-follow-prompt.png|487px]]

Clicking "FOLLOW" on that screen completes the follow action, and should show a success message like this:

==== gRegor article post ====
Screenshot of how an [[article]] post appears. Only the title and link is shown. The fed.brid.gy link under the title is a Mastodon oddity (see [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/391 GitHub issue]), but that URL redirects to the original post:
* https://fed.brid.gy/r/https://gregorlove.com/2023/01/farewell-fail-whale/

The link preview under that fed.brid.gy link is a direct link to the original post:

==== gRegor verification ====
Screenshot of how verification appears. The [[representative h-card]] on my homepage has links to gregorlove.com and gregorlove.com/about/ with [[u-url]] properties. My homepage also has an invisible <code><link rel="me" href="https://fed.brid.gy/r/https://gregorlove.com/"></code>. It appears that since fed.brid.gy is the delegated domain for my ActivityPub interactions, Mastodon is using that domain for [[rel-me]] verification. 

This screenshot is from indieweb.social viewed as the public, found by searching "gregorlove.com". The verification checkmark does not appear on every instance for some reason -- perhaps caching?

==== gRegor article with tags ====
Screenshot of my [https://gregorlove.com/2023/09/weekly-roundup/ original article] appearing in Mastodon hashtag search, with hashtags shown under the post. This appears to be new as of Mastodon v4.2.0 based on comparing hashtag search on a couple instances running earlier versions. These screenshots were taken on https://indieweb.social/tags/weeklyroundup (search) and on the post permalink, not signed in to Mastodon.

== Troubleshooting ==
These are troubleshooting steps for IndieWeb users of Bridgy Fed, in particular for federating out from a personal site to ActivityPub instances.

You might want to first review the Bridgy Docs about error handling in case something there applies to the problem you are having:
* https://fed.brid.gy/docs#error-handling

=== Activity not showing up in dashboard ===
If you publish a new post on your personal site, and send a Webmention to https://fed.brid.gy/ to federate that post out, you should see an entry in your dashboard. You can access your dashboard by entering your domain on the form on the https://fed.brid.gy/. E.g. {{t}}’s domain leads to:
* https://fed.brid.gy/web/tantek.com (example dashboard)

If you don't see an activity at the top of the list corresponding to your new post, there are several things you should check.

==== Verify link to Bridgy Fed ====

First, verify that your post has a link to Bridgy Fed.

View source on your original post and make sure that it has a valid link to Bridgy Fed, as documented in https://fed.brid.gy/docs#web-how-post, like:
<pre><a href="https://fed.brid.gy/" hidden="from-humans"></a></pre>

If you can’t find such a link, then Bridgy Fed won’t federate your post.
* Solution: add such a link to your post, republish, and resend a Webmention to https://fed.brid.gy/

If you have such a link somewhere inside the source of your post permalink, then the next step is to verify that your Webmention is being properly received by https://fed.brid.gy/ and processed.

==== Verify Webmention is received by Bridgy Fed ====

Next, verify that when you send a Webmention from your post to Bridgy Fed, that the server receives it and processes it.

For verifying that your Webmention was received, if you are using a [[Webmention#Publisher_Services|Webmention publishing service]] such as: 
* [[mention.tech]]
* [[Telegraph]]
* [[webmention.app]]
* ...
to send a webmention from your post to https://fed.brid.gy/, then be sure that:
* fed.brid.gy is actually listed among the links that will be sent Webmentions
** e.g. in the https://telegraph.p3k.io/dashboard you have to enter a URL first, and it displays a list of which URLs it will send webmentions to, but sometimes it misses some links, e.g. https://telegraph.p3k.io/dashboard/send?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftantek.com%2F2024%2F023%2Ft1%2Fshould-public-posts-flow-across-sites&account=993 does not list https://fed.brid.gy/ when that post was published and did have a link in its source
*** Issue to be filed.
** e.g. https://webmention.app/ when you enter a URL in the input to "Check a URL for webmentions" and click "Start", it only displays 10 links. also it seems to only find links inside post content, rather than all links inside a post (such as links in a [[reply-context]]). so it might also not list https://fed.brid.gy/ depending on where you put the link to it in your post.
* ...

Then send the Webmention using the tool or service or your choice, and make sure that:
* There are no error messages, e.g. mention.tech may display a red ❌ indicating that something went wrong


If you have confirmed that Bridgy Fed received the webmention, e.g. by a confirmation display or HTTP return code like 200, 201, 202, then reload you Bridgy Fed dashboard. Within seconds you should see your new post as an activity at the top of the list there.


If it has been a minute since you confirmed that the webmention was received, and nothing new has shown up at the top of your dashboard activities list, then you may need to troubleshoot further with help from the community:
* Join the [[discuss#dev|#indieweb dev chat channel]]
* Ask for help with Bridgy Fed, note the problem you’re having, and what steps you took (e.g. from above) with which tools or services.
