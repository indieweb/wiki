== Criticism ==

=== Company focus on Influencers ===
The company behind Bloglovin' is focused on their influencer network "Activate" more than blog readers ([https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/bloglovin-activate/ TechCrunch: Bloglovinâ€™ becomes Activate]). Activate was later [https://impact.com/press-releases/impact-acquires-activate-influencer-marketing-platform/ acquired by Impact], a marketing company.  The suggested blogs to follow on Bloglovin' are primarily lifestyle blogs.

=== Possibly Abandoned ===
The site's last [https://blog.bloglovin.com/ Last official blog post] is from 2017 suggesting Bloglovin as a product is no longer a priority. Furthermore, all of the top people on the [https://www.bloglovin.com/about about page] show [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=bloglovin' on LinkedIn] that they left the company in 2017.

=== Buggy Interface ===
Bloglovin' will often show "Page not found" errors, even for pages like the home page. These errors go away on next load. Searching for a blog's RSS url also frequently fails.
