== Criticism ==

=== Focus on Influencers ===
The company behind Bloglovin' is focused on their influencer network "Activate" more than blog readers ([https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/bloglovin-activate/ TechCrunch: Bloglovinâ€™ becomes Activate]).  The suggested blogs to follow are primarily lifestyle blogs. The site's last [https://blog.bloglovin.com/ Last official blog post] is from 2017 suggesting Bloglovin as a product is no longer a priority.

=== Buggy Interface ===
Bloglovin' will often show "Page not found" errors, even for pages like the home page. These errors go away on next load. Searching for a blog's RSS url also frequently fails.
