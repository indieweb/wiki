=== Virtual Homebrew Website Club: Blogging 101 ===
This weekly (Wed 2:00 pm edt -5 UTC) in the summer focuses on people just beginning to blog or adopt IndieWeb philosophies and tools into their blogging platform.

Given the target audience much of the conversation revolves around using WordPress.

People may stop by to:
- have a quite working hour
- show off their website or blog
- ask about changing basic set ups like header images or font choices
- how to install indieweb plugins
- just to chill
