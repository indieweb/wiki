'''<dfn>[https://bearblog.dev/ Bear Blog]</dfn>''' is a blog hosting [[service]] and [[open source]] platform describing itself as “no-nonsense”, with lightweight pages, supports custom domains, and is used by some community members for their personal sites..

== Overview ==

* By default every blog lives on a [[subdomain]]. Users have to upgrade to the paid plan ($6/month or $59/year as of 2024-07-31) to be able to bring their own [[personal domain]].

* It has [[longevity]] as a stated goal.

}}

* Only limited support for IndieWeb [[building blocks]]. The templates cannot be modified and do not include any [[microformats]]. The paid plan will allow adding elements to the <code><head></code> of the page, which would allow adding externally hosted services for [[Webmentions]] and [[IndieAuth]].

* It is written in [[Python]] with the source code available on [[GitHub]]: https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/

== IndieWeb Friendly ==
* The [https://bear.nolt.io/roadmap roadmap] has an issue under consideration to support a blog API and [[Micropub]] was mentioned as an option: https://bear.nolt.io/2
* Built with [[longevity]] in mind: {{citation
