'''<dfn>[https://bearblog.dev/ Bear Blog]</dfn>''' is a blog hosting [[service]] and [[open source]] platform describing itself as “no-nonsense”.

== Overview ==

* By default every blog lives on a [[subdomain]]. Users have to upgrade to the paid plan ($6/month or $59/year as of 2024-07-31) to be able to bring their own [[personal domain]].

* It has [[longevity]] as a stated goal.
