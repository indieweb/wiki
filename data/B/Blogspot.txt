'''<dfn>Blogspot</dfn>''' was the original name given to the hosted version (silo) of the [[Blogger]] blogging tool. Now "Blogspot.com" is one of several domains that users can use to create hosted blogs. Blogger and Blogspot are owned by [[Google]].

== History ==
Blogspot started with a $500 PC purchased at the Palo Alto Fry's and was up & running that night:
<blockquote>"September 2000: Me and @ev jumped in my car in SF and drove to the Palo Alto Fry's to buy a $500 Celeron-powered HP home computer that was on sale. We booted it up back in the office, installed Apache, and it started serving up every early *.blogspot.com site that evening." <cite style="float:right; text-align:right">[http://a.wholelottanothing.org @mathowie],  [https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/1364452713736540165 February 24, 2021]</cite></blockquote>

The original Blogspot server’s machine name was Gutenburg:
<blockquote>"Here’s the machine today (in my garage). I think we served 10k’s of blogs off that sucker.  Good times."<cite style="float:right; text-align:right">[http://ev.medium.com/ @ev], [https://twitter.com/ev/status/1364471391118970882 February 24, 2021]</cite></blockquote>
