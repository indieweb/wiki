* History: Started with a $500 PC purchased at the Palo Alto Fry's and was up & running that night https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/1364452713736540165
** "September 2000: Me and @ev jumped in my car in SF and drove to the Palo Alto Fry's to buy a $500 Celeron-powered HP home computer that was on sale. We booted it up back in the office, installed Apache, and it started serving up every early *.blogspot.com site that evening." [http://a.wholelottanothing.org @mathowie] February 24, 2021
