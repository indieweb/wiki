'''<dfn>[https://blueskyweb.org/ Bluesky]</dfn>''' is a project run by Jay Graber and initially proposed by Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO, to ‚Äúdevelop an open and decentralized standard for social media ‚Äì The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard.‚Äù.

Bluesky is a public-benefit LLC. After early funding from Twitter, it was spun out as its own company before Elon Musk acquired Twitter. It now operates independently, and is entirely employee-owned.

Bluesky's CEO is Jay Graber. The board of directors includes Jay Graber, Jack Dorsey, and Jeremie Miller. They each have equal voting power.

== Why ==
(stub section)

Why use or syndicate to Bluesky?

It's another interesting social web protocol experiment that has goals of decentralization and prioritizes user identity and [[migration]] (accounts and posts).

== How to ==
=== How to use your domain ===
* Thread (on Twitter, ironic yes) showing people using their own domains for the bluesky identifiers: https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1650189488394756097

=== How to POSSE ===
(stub - needs to be filled in, several IndieWeb community members are POSSEing to Bluesky, so let's document best practices for POSSEing to Bluesky)

== Features ==
(stub)

Bluesky has been roughly described as [[Twitter]]-like, thus has a similar set of [[Twitter#Features|features as Twitter]].

* create & delete posts (edit?)
** [[note]]
** [[photo]]
* domain as identity / username
* ...
* API / Protocols

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
* {{aaronpk}} uses his short domain <code>aaronpk.com</code> as his Bluesky handle [https://aaronparecki.com/2023/03/07/3/bluesky-custom-domain since 2023-03-06], and has been syndicating his posts to Bluesky [https://aaronparecki.com/2023/03/06/14/bluesky since 2023-03-06]
** Since 2023-05-01, removing the <code>staging.bsky.app/profile</code> part of Bluesky URLs to his posts will redirect to the canonical post on aaronparecki.com. For example
*** <code>https://staging.bsky.app/profile/aaronpk.com/post/3juasablkof2o</code>
*** <code>aaronpk.com/post/3juasablkof2o</code>
*** redirects to <code>https://aaronparecki.com/2023/04/25/26/</code>

I‚Äôve done a little work now with the XRPC layer of the AT Protocol, supporting cross-posting to Bluesky from Micro.blog. This post is about what I‚Äôve learned.

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} publishes manually to Bluesky every so often. He is working on a few open-source projects related to Bluesky:

* [https://github.com/capjamesg/pyatproto pyatproto]: A Python package with abstract methods for interacting with the Bluesky API.
* [https://github.com/capjamesg/bsky.link bsky.link]: A link wrapper service that generates a minimal, embeddable version of a Bluesky post, ideal for embedding in journalism and blogs. Example posts:
** https://bsky.link/?url=https://staging.bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social/post/3jureynmuos2i
** https://bsky.link/?url=https://staging.bsky.app/profile/jamesg.blog/post/3jttk3dwqkk2e

=== Jacky Alcine ===
* {{jacky}} uses his main domain <code>jacky.wtf</code> as his handle (since ???).
** Currently, all cross-posting happens manually

=== Ana Rodrigues ===
* {{ana-r}} with her domain <code>ohhelloana.blog</code> as handle.
** Currently, some cross-posting happens manually. Still debating if where all posts will live.

== IndieWeb Features ==
* personal domain as identity: https://aaronparecki.com/2023/03/06/18/domains
** "I'm glad to see that BlueSky supports custom domains! I have zero interest in sitting on a username in the bluesky namespace. Setting it up was roughly the same as pointing your own domain to a hosting provider, and a lot easier than Mastodon/ActivityPub!" [https://aaronparecki.com/ @Aaron Parecki] March 6, 2023

== IndieWeb Requests ==
Requests to add support for [[building blocks]] to make the service more IndieWeb [[friendly]]:
* [[IndieAuth]]: Support signing-in with IndieAuth: [https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/issues/646 #646 Add support for authentication with IndieAuth]

== Tools ==
* Generate embeddable links featuring Bluesky posts: https://bsky.link

* "Jack is many things, but an idiot he is not. He's whip smart. He knows we exist, he literally follows us. <br><br>This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android." [https://joinmastodon.org @joinmastodon] December 11, 2019
