'''<dfn>[https://blueskyweb.org/ Bluesky]</dfn>''' is another project with [[Twitter]]-like features with its own protocols for and approach to open and decentralized social media that several IndieWeb community members POSSE to.

If you are looking for the open protocol being developed by Bluesky, see:
* '''[[AT Protocol]]'''

== Why ==
(stub section)

Why use or syndicate to Bluesky?

It's another interesting social web protocol experiment that has goals of decentralization and prioritizes user identity and [[data portability]] (both [[account migration]] and [[post migration]]).

...

== How to ==
=== How to use your domain ===
The Bluesky blog has steps to use your domain name as your handle, either by setting up [[DNS#DNS_Record_Types|DNS TXT]] records or [[.well-known]] URL on your site.

=== How to POSSE ===
(stub - needs to be filled in, several IndieWeb community members are POSSEing to Bluesky, so let's document best practices for POSSEing to Bluesky)

* [[Bridgy]] supports [https://brid.gy/about#publish-types Bridgy publishing to Bluesky] since [https://snarfed.org/2024-02-05_52058 2024-02-05]

* {{colinwalker}} has written about how he [https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-12-15#p2 POSSEs to Bluesky] using PHP and https://github.com/cjrasmussen/BlueskyApi

== Features ==

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
* {{aaronpk}} uses his short domain <code>aaronpk.com</code> as his Bluesky handle [https://aaronparecki.com/2023/03/07/3/bluesky-custom-domain since 2023-03-06], and has been syndicating his posts to Bluesky [https://aaronparecki.com/2023/03/06/14/bluesky since 2023-03-06]
** Since 2023-05-01, removing the <code>staging.bsky.app/profile</code> part of Bluesky URLs to his posts will redirect to the canonical post on aaronparecki.com. For example
*** <code>https://staging.bsky.app/profile/aaronpk.com/post/3juasablkof2o</code>
*** <code>aaronpk.com/post/3juasablkof2o</code>
*** redirects to <code>https://aaronparecki.com/2023/04/25/26/</code>

I‚Äôve done a little work now with the XRPC layer of the AT Protocol, supporting cross-posting to Bluesky from Micro.blog. This post is about what I‚Äôve learned.

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} publishes manually to Bluesky every so often. He is working on a few open-source projects related to Bluesky:

* [https://github.com/capjamesg/pyatproto pyatproto]: A Python package with abstract methods for interacting with the Bluesky API.
* [https://github.com/capjamesg/bsky.link bsky.link]: A link wrapper service that generates a minimal, embeddable version of a Bluesky post, ideal for embedding in journalism and blogs. Example posts:

** https://bsky.link/?url=https://staging.bsky.app/profile/jamesg.blog/post/3jttk3dwqkk2e

=== Jacky Alcine ===
* {{jacky}} uses his main domain <code>jacky.wtf</code> as his handle (since ???).
** Currently, all cross-posting happens manually

=== Ana Rodrigues ===
* {{ana-r}} with her domain <code>ohhelloana.blog</code> as handle.
** Currently, some cross-posting happens manually. Still debating if where all posts will live. 

=== Marty McGuire ===
* {{schmarty}} with his domain <code>martymcgui.re</code> as handle.
* Cross-posting a small set of things manually, like [[This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition]]

=== Vika ===
* {{vikanezrimaya}} uses one of her domains, <code>vikanezrimaya.xyz</code> as a handle since 2023-06-15.
* POSSE is currently done manually, but Bluesky adoption may be a driver for better syndication support in [[Kittybox]].

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}}: I set up my account 2023-10-26 using gregorlove.com as my handle. I was going to wait for [[POSSE]] support, but when I saw [[Bridgy]] supported [[backfeed]] already, I decided to try it out. I'm currently manually cross-posting from my site.

First post:
* https://gregorlove.com/2023/10/hello-ladies/
* which has a [[u-syndication]] of https://bsky.app/profile/gregorlove.com/post/3kcod6pfy6e2h

** "I'm glad to see that BlueSky supports custom domains! I have zero interest in sitting on a username in the bluesky namespace.

You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle‚Äîno matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</blockquote>

Q: Is Bluesky Twitter controlled?

A: In short, no.

A [[#New_Organization|separate organization]] from Twitter was announced 2022-02-07. Twitter also has no equity or other involvement in Bluesky. [https://snarfed.org/bluesky-corporate-ownership-and-structure Citations here.] Notably:

<blockquote>Twitter‚Äôs funding of Bluesky is not subject to any conditions except one: that Bluesky is to research and develop technologies that enable open and decentralized public conversation.</blockquote>

In response to criticism & thread: https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1204791506143457281
* "Jack is many things, but an idiot he is not. He's whip smart. He knows we exist, he literally follows us. <br><br>This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android." [https://joinmastodon.org @joinmastodon] December 11, 2019

== Criticism ==
=== Handwavy ===
* https://twitter.com/hallam/status/1536338344665292803
** "It is worth noting that this is the second hand wavy proposal Dorsey has come up with in the space of 12 months. BlueSky promised much the same.<br><br>The Stolen Valor of calling it ‚ÄòWeb/X‚Äô should be a warning as should the fact that CryptoPonzi land is sinking today as Celsius rugs." [http://www.hallambaker.com/ @hallam] June 13, 2022

=== Addictive ===
* https://pagan.plus/@siin/111280543307154948 <blockquote>"I've been on BlueSky for 10 minutes and... (An Essay)I get it now. I used to be like "Why can't people just stop using Twitter/Instagram/WhateverTheFuck? If they need social media, why can't they just use Mastodon? Why doesn't Pixelfed get more users? It's literally the same UI".But I get it. I've been on BlueSky for what? 10 minutes? And I can feel my brain chemistry changing. Mastodon is a coffee shop. It doles out caffeine. You still get the little dopamine hit when you get notifications, you get that kind of substitute for human interaction that feels nice. But Twitter and BlueSky and Instagram and these apps from companies with access to inordinate amounts of data to build algorithms designed by psychologists to literally be As Addicting as Possible? These apps are dealing meth. But they've pressed it like ecstasy and made it cute. They've made it socially acceptable.</blockquote>

=== Substitute for human interaction ===
* https://pagan.plus/@siin/111280543307154948  <blockquote>Because sometimes in my life I feel isolated and because this substitute for human interaction feels nice.</blockquote>

=== Invasive privacy policy ===
* https://pagan.plus/@siin/111280543307154948  <blockquote>‚Ä¶ then there's their privacy policy. Access to websites you visit before and after, identifying information about your device, purchases you make, and it goes on. But even that level of invasive access should give us pause, right? I have a lot of things set up on my computer that mitigate *some* of that access, but then let's think about how we give the app access to our photos and videos (all of them, not just what we post in the moment), our device's camera and microphone (not just while we're using it) and so on. And then think about how our society grooms us to believe (and maybe in some circumstances this belief is true) that we *need* these sites for access, for engagement, to make money. The price of not working in a warehouse is every piece of information we can reasonably gather about you to use and sell however we please, for whatever purpose, indefinitely, and it never expires and we don't pay you for it. This *is* exploitation and my ancestry makes me pause, horrified, at what this information *will* eventually come back and do to us when inevitably the wrong person/group gets ahold of it. And that's pretending like we even know who has our data and what they're doing with it, right? Because we don't know. We really don't. Call me paranoid, say that I shouldn't worry if I have nothing to hide, give me all of the excuses you've been programmed to give about why we *should not* worry about a surveillance state that *we* pay for. Then come online and rant about how dangerous governments are and fail to see the irony in it all.</blockquote>

== Company Structure ==
Bluesky is a public-benefit C crop, and project initially proposed by Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO, to ‚Äúdevelop an open and decentralized standard for social media‚Äù, hired Jay Graber as CEO, and has a board of directors that include both of them and Jeremie Miller. They each have equal voting power. For more info see:
