'''<dfn>[https://blueskyweb.org/ Bluesky]</dfn>''' is a project run by Jay Graber and initially proposed by Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO, to ‚Äúdevelop an open and decentralized standard for social media ‚Äì The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard.‚Äù.

Bluesky is a public-benefit LLC. After early funding from Twitter, it was spun out as its own company before Elon Musk acquired Twitter. It now operates independently, and is entirely employee-owned.

Bluesky's CEO is Jay Graber. The board of directors includes Jay Graber, Jack Dorsey, and Jeremie Miller. They each have equal voting power.

** "It is worth noting that this is the second hand wavy proposal Dorsey has come up with in the space of 12 months. BlueSky promised much the same.<br><br>The Stolen Valor of calling it ‚ÄòWeb/X‚Äô should be a warning as should the fact that CryptoPonzi land is sinking today as Celsius rugs."

=== Not Twitter controlled ===

* "Jack is many things, but an idiot he is not. He's whip smart. He knows we exist, he literally follows us. <br><br>This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android." [https://joinmastodon.org @joinmastodon] December 11, 2019
