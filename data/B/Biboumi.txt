<blockquote>Biboumi is an [[XMPP]] <dfn>gateway</dfn> that connects to [[IRC]] servers and translates between the two protocols. It can be used to access IRC channels using any XMPP client as if these channels were XMPP MUCs.</blockquote>

== Use case ==
Biboumi is a self-hostable, FOSS gateway daemon that works with your XMPP server that can act as an IRC bouncer to IRC networks. This gives users access to the IRC history & interact with chatrooms from the comfort of their existing XMPP clients rather than having to run a separate IRC clients.
