'''<dfn>Black Friday Create Day</dfn>''' is an IndieWeb [[Create Day]] held on ''Black Friday'', the day after US Thanksgiving. Rather than participate in big retail sales, we create, build and write on our websites.


== Planning ==
* 2026!
* Black Friday will fall on Friday November 27, 2025
* What time should it start?
* How long should it go?
* How long before the date should the event be created?
* ''Add ideas here...''
