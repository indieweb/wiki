}} announced the discontinuation of Beaker: <blockquote>I'm going to be closing down this project in the very near future. I'll do a post mortem and share more, but in the intro to my follow-on project I do give a few words on why I felt it was time to change the approach: https://atek.cloud/blog/hello-world</blockquote>

}} talks a little more about Beaker (in the past tense):<blockquote>The challenge was that Beaker apps had no backend. If you want to build 100% client-side SPAs, you need something akin to a Firebase: a toolkit of databases, users/identity, and networking. We took a lot of shots at building that, but struggled to create APIs which matched the browser's security and page-based runtime model. Having to create a single monolithic stack for everybody to use is difficult, and ran against many people's expectations of what a browser is and is supposed to do. A home cloud is a more natural fit for this.</blockquote>
