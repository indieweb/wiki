{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://enwp.org/BBCode BBCode]</dfn>''' is a text markup convention supported by bulletin boards (hence the BB) that can be used to enhance otherwise plain text content with clearly code-like instructions to add various features, and is a source of IndieWeb brainstorming for expressing a [[spoiler]] or [[content warning]].


== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{chrisbergr}} plans to add some bbcodes to his website. The website runs on WordPress, but post types like notes ([[notes]]) are written as plain as possible. The currently planned codes are:
** [SPOILER]...[/SPOILER] to be able to write about movies and series without taking away the excitement from the readers ([[spoiler]])
** [TW]...[/TW] To add a trigger warning ([[content warning]]) in the form of an overlay over the content. This should also cover topics such as cigarette consumption and alcohol consumption as well as non-vegan food. This may sound exaggerated, but I want to write about all topics that concern me, even if I know that they might make one or the other reader uncomfortable.
