'''<dfn>reactions</dfn>''' refer to the subset of [[responses]]/[[interactions]] with a [[post]] that are quicker, more impulsive, but still a conscious act, typically a simple UI gesture without writing any content, such as [[like]]s, [[repost]]s, [[bookmark]]s, or perhaps multiple simple UI gestures, such as selection a text range and posting a [[quotation]] of part of a post, or picking a person from a list to post an [[invitation]] as a response to seeing an [[event]].
