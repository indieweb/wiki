The '''<dfn>IndieWeb Challenge</dfn>''' is to collectively ship something IndieWeb-related that benefits the community, people in addition to yourself, every day of December! Anyone can participate, and if you're looking for something to do, see the '''[[#Inspiration|Inspiration section below]]'''. This can be anything from major wiki contributions / improvements to shipping updates on any of the [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], plugins (or updates thereof), see [[2018-12-indieweb-challenge|last year’s challenge]] (where we shipped something every day!) for more examples.
__TOC__
Please keep in mind the '''[[#Considerations|Considerations]]''' and if you’re not sure, you may want to first make a commitment (and follow through) to ship something you’ll use on your own site, as it will likely help reveal ways to improve things for the community as a whole:

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below!

== Considerations ==
Please keep in mind the following considerations when adding something to a day:
* It must be shipping / usable, not just a blog post announcing / saying you plan to do it.
* Is it clear what your thing does?
* Is it clear how someone is supposed to use it or otherwise benefit from it?
* What use-case does it solve for others (besides yourself)? Ask yourself, how would/could someone else in the community use the thing I'm posting? 
* If it's a markup / styling example, is it clear what its purpose is, and how someone could/should copy the markup/styling and customize it for their own site?
* If it's a programming example, is it clear how an indieweb site could use the code, using what language(s)? Does it require any frameworks?
* If it's a code example or project, is it clearly open sourced, with a clear link to its GitHub or other code repo that has at least a README explaining how it can be used for either direct user benefit or to enhance existing indieweb sites?

== Inspiration ==
Looking for something to do to benefit the community?

In general (feel free to add things here that you find inspiring in general, or hope someone else is inspired to do :)
* '''[[to-do]]''' and look for something you can do in a day!
* look for easy [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues IndieWebify issues] to fix, fix one, and get an update deployed
* New release of [[microformats2]] parser(s)
** php-mf2
** ...
* Work on [[2019-review]] and previous years that weren't completed
* ...

Specific inspirations:
* {{t}}: In addition to [[to-do]] items I've added (which anyone should feel free to snipe), I want to:
** Update [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing mf2 parsing spec] with resolved issues
** Move [https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/ mf2 issues] forward in state per the mf2 parsing spec change process
*** Determine set of GitHub Labels for mf2 issues based on [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing#change_control mf2 parsing spec change process] (similar to / re-use from [https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels those on the CSSWG repo]), consider also what labels would help [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#change_control h-entry change process].
*** Add minimum necessary Labels to the mf2 issues repo to capture and make explicit issue / change proposal stages / next action needed / waiting for.
*** Use space separated labels using underscores in hashtags per [[Falcon#tags_with_spaces|Falcon working on: tags with spaces]] to add labels in reply posts to GitHub issues on CSSWG, mf2 repos
* {{gRegor}}: I'm interested in getting a new release of [[php-mf2]] out.
** I have a handful of pull requests that have been reviewed but not merged, if another contributor could double check those and merge that would be much appreciated
** Are there any other open issues we can quickly fix and merge before the release?
* {{fluffy}} I'd love to work with someone to get [[AutoAuth]] in a usable state.
** One compatible [[IndieAuth]] user endpoint
** One commandline tool and/or client library for acquiring a bearer token
** Finish up the AutoAuth-specific protocol support in [[Publ CMS]]'s resource token generator

== In progress ==
Got something you're working on for the IndieWeb Challenge but it's not quite complete or ready for community re-use? Feel free to link to it here while you're working on it, especially if you'd like others to review it, provide feedback etc.
