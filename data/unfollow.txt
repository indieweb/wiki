{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Unfollow</dfn>''' is the opposite action of [[follow]]ing someone, typically on a [[silo]], commonly implemented on asymmetric follow silos such as [[Instagram]], [[Google+]], initially pioneered by [[delicious]], [[Flickr]], and [[Upcoming]], but most greatly popularized by [[Twitter]] in contrast to the mutual [[friend]]ing model from explicitly "social" silos from [[Friendster]] to [[Facebook]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no known indieweb examples of an "unfollow" feature.

== Silo Examples ==
Examples of silos that implement an "unfollow" feature in their user interface, along with some differences.

* [[Instagram]] - upon unfollowing someone, refreshing your reader view removes posts from that someone
* [[Google+]] - If you remove someone from circles i.e. unfollow them, then the previous post you received also disappear from timeline.
* [[delicious]]
* [[Facebook]] - started as a symmetric friending model only, later added ability to only "follow" people rather than "add friend" (request friendship)
** You can also "unfollow" a post, that is, stop receiving notifications for it which you may have been automatically receiving because you wrote the post, you were tagged in it, or you RSVPd to it, etc.
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Twitter]] - upon unfollowing someone, you won't see future posts from them, but their past posts will still show up in your reader (home page) view 
** emergent behavior: people post "@-name unfollow" posts when they are either annoyed with someone and threatening to unfollow, or do so sarcastically/ironically in response to some humorous thread. In neither case do they actually unfollow the person. So in practice there are "unfollow" posts that aren't actual unfollows.
