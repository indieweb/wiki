'''<dfn>archived post</dfn>''' is a feature on some [[social media]] silos that allows a user to make a post private only to themselves, removing it from their feed / stream / timeline or other listings of their posts. [[Instagram]] supports arching posts. No known IndieWeb Examples.

=== Jacky Alcine ===
Although it's explicit done as a [[deleted#Jacky_Alcine|deletion]], [[Koype]] handles a form of archiving by flagging it as deleted. The representation of it to site viewers is that of a post that's been deleted with no information about what it was.
