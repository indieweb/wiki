'''<dfn>audience</dfn>''' is an experimental property of a post that indicates the intended recipients (readers) of the post. The audience property value is an [[h-card]] for the person or group that is the intended audience.

* There are plans to also use this field to control access to [[private posts]]

=== Sven Knebel ===
{{sknebel}} has implemented a prototype of [[AutoAuth]]. The audience for posts secured through it is a list of URLs, which the requesting token has to be obtained for.

=== Vincent Pickering ===
{{Vincent}} occasionally publishes posts with an explicit audience [https://vincentp.me/notes/2019/03/07/12-00/ since 2019-03-07].
* This is being used because my blog straddles a few different disciplines and I wanted users to understand which context I am speaking within.
* Controlled by a simple frontmatter addition outputting the relevant tags

== Questions ==
=== Synchronized audiences ===
Many systems have groups with membership, and if a member posts to a group the audience is automatically the group members. In an Indieweb example, this might be useful too: if I e.g. create an audience of "HWC Berlin attendees", other attendees should be able to easily post with the same audience. Ideas:
* published (potentially access protected) lists of users, audience property refers to that
* local list following a published list, asking for confirmation for changes
* …?

== Silo examples == 
* [[Nextdoor]] has a choice for where your posts go, between only your neighborhood, or a collection of local neighbourhoods.
** [[File:Nextdoor post.PNG|600px]] [[File:Nextdoor select neighborhood.PNG|600px]]
* [[Facebook]] allows one to prescribe a specific audience by using its [https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/lists/ friends list functionality]. More details about the options can be found on their [https://www.facebook.com/help/120939471321735 help page].
