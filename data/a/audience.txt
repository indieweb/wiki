{{stub}}

'''<dfn>audience</dfn>''' is an experimental property of a post that indicates the intended recipients (readers) of the post.

== Why ==
You may want to explicitly denote the audience of a post so that viewers of the post have a better understanding of who the post was written for, or perhaps who may see the post for non-public posts.

== How to ==
The methods of publishing the audience of a post are still being figured out, along with any consuming code use-cases. See [[#Brainstorming]] until that's figured out.

== Indieweb examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has been occasionally publishing posts with an explicit audience, [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/03/22/4/micropub-pr since 2017-03-22].
* 2017-03-22 [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/03/22/4/micropub-pr This note about micropub]
** audience: public-socialweb@w3.org list POSSE copy: [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-socialweb/2017Mar/0019.html Micropub PR transition request] (no link back to original)
* 2017-06-13 [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/06/13/6/indieweb-summit IndieWeb Summit 2017]
** audience: private email list
** POSSE copy: [https://twitter.com/IndieWebSummit/status/874689837952933888 @IndieWebSummit]

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} occasionally publishes posts with an explicit audience [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/18/14/note/ since 2018-11-18].
* Currently it's mostly been focused on posts written for online university classes [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/15/20/note/ like this post].
* There are plans to also use this field to control access to [[private posts]]

=== Sven Knebel ===
{{sknebel}} has implemented a prototype of [[AutoAuth]]. The audience for posts secured through it is a list of URLs, which the requesting token has to be obtained for.

=== Vincent Pickering ===
{{Vincent}} occasionally publishes posts with an explicit audience [https://vincentp.me/notes/2019/03/07/12-00/ since 2019-03-07].
* This is being used because my blog straddles a few different disciplines and I wanted users to understand which context I am speaking within.
* Controlled by a simple frontmatter addition outputting the relevant tags

== Brainstorming ==
=== use-cases ===
==== posting only to a local timeline ====
* https://xoxo.zone/@andybaio/100516109185372930
** "Is there any way to post a message SOLELY to your local timeline? That would be pretty cool." [https://xoxo.zone/@andybaio @andybaio] August 8, 2018

=== audience property h-card ===
The <code>audience</code> property value is an [[h-card]] for the person or group that is the intended audience of an [[h-entry]].

== Questions ==
=== Synchronized audiences ===
Many systems have groups with membership, and if a member posts to a group the audience is automatically the group members. In an Indieweb example, this might be useful too: if I e.g. create an audience of "HWC Berlin attendees", other attendees should be able to easily post with the same audience. Ideas:
* published (potentially access protected) lists of users, audience property refers to that
* local list following a published list, asking for confirmation for changes
* â€¦?

== Silo examples == 
=== [[Nextdoor]] ===
Choices are presented for where your posts go, between only your neighborhood, or a collection of local neighbourhoods.

=== [[Facebook]] ===
The platform allows one to prescribe a specific audience by using its [https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/lists/ friends list functionality]. More details about the options can be found on their [https://www.facebook.com/help/120939471321735 help page].
