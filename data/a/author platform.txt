'''<dfn>Author platform</dfn>''' or sometimes '''<dfn>writer platform</dfn>''' is the concept of having the ability to sell books (or other goods) because of who you are or who you can [[reach]] and very often begins with having a personal [[website]] and [[personal-domain]] as a hub.

In the pre-web era, the (centralized) publishing industry considered an author's platform their ability to reach and sell books to a broader audience. This typically applied to non-fiction authors, personalities, and celebrities that had the ability to drive a big part of the publicity for their books by appearing on/in television (talk shows, variety shows, political shows, etc.), radio, newspapers, magazines and other media (typically due to their fame). This free/less-expensive publicity was used to increase sales of books and improve margins.

In the internet era, many build their platform over a career by using a website as a primary hub where they can conglomerate [[followers]] / [[subscribe|subscribers]] and engage them on a regular basis by sending them messages, updates, [[newsletter]]s, and sales pitches. 

IndieWeb [[principles]] and concepts like [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] can assist writers (and many others) by allowing them to publish in one central place and [[syndicate]] to social [[silo|silos]] for increased [[reach]] and interaction in a [[DRY|DRY (don't repeat yourself)]] manner thus freeing up time for them to write on their projects and spend less time on outreach and publicity.

== Silo examples ==
Many authors rely on siloed versions of social media to build their networks. This can often be a mistake because of the frequency of [[site-deaths]] or the tying of one's personal brand to that of a social silo that doesn't hold the same values as the person in question. (See also: [[identity]])
