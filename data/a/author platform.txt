'''<dfn>Author platform</dfn>''' or sometimes '''<dfn>writer platform</dfn>''' is the concept of having the ability to sell books (or other goods) because of who you are or who you can [[reach]] and very often begins with having a personal [[website]] and [[personal-domain]] as a hub.

In the pre-web era, the (centralized) publishing industry considered an author's platform their ability to reach and sell books to a broader audience. This typically applied to non-fiction authors, personalities, and celebrities that had the ability to drive a big part of the publicity for their books by appearing on/in television (talk shows, variety shows, political shows, etc.), radio, newspapers, magazines and other media (typically due to their fame). This free/less-expensive publicity was used to increase sales of books and improve margins.

In the internet era, many build their platform over a career by using a website as a primary hub where they can conglomerate [[followers]] / [[subscribe|subscribers]] and engage them on a regular basis by sending them messages, updates, [[newsletter]]s, and sales pitches. 

IndieWeb [[principles]] and concepts like [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] can assist writers (and many others) by allowing them to publish in one central place and [[syndicate]] to social [[silo|silos]] for increased [[reach]] and interaction in a [[DRY|DRY (don't repeat yourself)]] manner thus freeing up time for them to write on their projects and spend less time on outreach and publicity.

== IndieWeb examples ==
=== Jeremy Keith ===
{{adactio}} uses his website in part as an author platform to promote his books (and Clearleft, his business) by regularly writing about web design and other related topics. He also uses related [[personal-domain]]s to distribute books he's written (example: https://resilientwebdesign.com/)

=== Corey Doctorow ===
[https://craphound.com/ Corey Doctorow] uses his website to promote (and sell) his work, [https://craphound.com/category/news/ public appearances], and [https://craphound.com/shop/ books]. He provides many of his books for free as well as in [[DRM]]-free options.

=== dana boyd ===

== Silo examples ==
Many authors rely on siloed versions of social media to build their networks. This can often be a mistake because of the frequency of [[site-deaths]] or the tying of one's personal brand to that of a social silo that doesn't hold the same values as the person in question. (See also: [[identity]])
