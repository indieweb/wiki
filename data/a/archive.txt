'''<dfn>archive</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb refers to date-grouped (often monthly) sets of posts (AKA <dfn>personal historical archives</dfn>, a common form of [[navigation]]), but can sometimes mean '''<dfn>[[archival copy]]</dfn>''', a copy of a web page made (often by someone other than the author) at a particular point in time.

For an archive of an entire site,
* see '''[[site archive]]'''

For “the Archive”, 
* see '''[[Internet Archive]]'''

== Why ==
Providing access to archives helps people browse your past content.

== How to ==
There are many approaches to providing archive navigation [[UI]].

Typically people provide links to specific months and years, sometimes in a list of links, sometimes in a list of years that expend to months, and then only the month links actually navigate you to archives for those months.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] to serve composite archive pages (unlinked) on tantek.com for each day since 2010, e.g.:
* http://tantek.com/2014/255/ with [[RSVP]], [[reply]], and [[note]] with [[auto-embed]] all from the same day
And before that, all his blog posts were written and served directly from archive pages by Gregorian month, [http://tantek.com/log/2002/08.html#L20020808 from 2002-08-08] to [http://tantek.com/log/2008/08.html 2008-08-08]

* http://aaronparecki.com/2014/09/10 with [[pushup]], [[reply]], [[bicycle]], [[note]], [[event]], [[bookmark]], and [[sleep]] all on the same day

There is also a monthly view which renders a calendar month in a table, and includes icons for each post, as well as a list of all the hashtags and locations from that day.
