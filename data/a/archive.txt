'''<dfn>archive</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb refers to date-grouped (often monthly) sets of posts (AKA <dfn>personal historical archives</dfn>, a common form of temporal [[navigation]]), but can sometimes mean '''<dfn>[[archival copy]]</dfn>''', a copy of a web page made (often by someone other than the author) at a particular point in time.

For an archive of an entire site,
* see '''[[site archive]]'''

For “the Archive”, 
* see '''[[Internet Archive]]'''

== Why ==
Providing access to archives helps people browse your past content.

== How to ==
There are many approaches to providing archive navigation [[UI]].

Typically people provide links to specific months and years, sometimes in a list of links, sometimes in a list of years that expend to months, and then only the month links actually navigate you to archives for those months.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] to serve composite archive pages (unlinked) on tantek.com for each day since 2010, e.g.:
* http://tantek.com/2014/255/ with [[RSVP]], [[reply]], and [[note]] with [[auto-embed]] all from the same day
And before that, all his blog posts were written and served directly from archive pages by Gregorian month, [http://tantek.com/log/2002/08.html#L20020808 from 2002-08-08] to [http://tantek.com/log/2008/08.html 2008-08-08]

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} uses [[WordPress]] to serve an archive index and archives on snarfed.org for posts since 2003-06-29:
* https://snarfed.org/archive
* https://snarfed.org/responses

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] to serve composite archive pages on aaronparecki.com [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-10-05/line/1412522094880 since 2014-10-05], e.g.:
* http://aaronparecki.com/2014/09/10 with [[pushup]], [[reply]], [[bicycle]], [[note]], [[event]], [[bookmark]], and [[sleep]] all on the same day

There is also a monthly view which renders a calendar month in a table, and includes icons for each post, as well as a list of all the hashtags and locations from that day.

=== cweiske ===
{{cweiske}} has an archive subdomain with a couple of hand-picked pages that disappeared - http://archive.cweiske.de/

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has an archive page at http://gregorlove.com/archives/ since 2011-02-14 [http://gregorlove.com/2011/02/1042/]. It is inspired by [[Tumblr]]'s archive page.
* {{t}}: beautiful design.

=== Shane Becker ===
{{veganstraightedge}} uses [[Dark Matter]] to serve composite and post type specific archive pages (unlinked) on http://veganstraightedge.com (with [[pagination]]) [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-10-07/line/1412713609581 since 2014-10-07], e.g.:
* http://veganstraightedge.com/2014/09/18 (all posts, notes and an article in this case, on this year/month/day)
* http://veganstraightedge.com/2014/09/18/page/3 (the third page of all posts on this year/month/day)
* http://veganstraightedge.com/videos/2013/05 (all videos from a year/month)
* http://veganstraightedge.com/notes/2014/10/06 (all notes from a year/month/day)

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{user|ben.thatmustbe.me|Ben Roberts|https://ben.thatmustbe.me/image/static/icon_64.jpg}} uses [[Postly]] to serve composite archives in either monthly (linked - /YYYY/MM) or daily (unlinked - /YYYY/MM/DD) format since 2014-10-07.

=== Rachel Andrew ===
[https://rachelandrew.co.uk/ Rachel Andrew] publishes an [https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/ archive view] with a few different tiers of visual hierarchy of past blog posts. At the top is a primary article with a background image and post name and subtitle. Next is 6 posts with colored backgrounds instead of photos, and one or two sentences in addition to the post name. Lastly are 8 more articles visually smaller and with shorter summaries.

=== Jonathan LaCour ===
{{cleverdevil}} has an archive page at https://cleverdevil.io/archive since 3/6/2018. The archive page shows content grouped by year and month, with options to view content within a particular month, or on a specific day via a link. Each year is displayed as a horizontal timeline with a pleasing gradient:

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} has several different types of archive pages.
* Eddie has an [[article]] archive page [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/02/9/article/ since 11/02/2018]. It groups articles by month and year, displaying the article titles and the day they were posted.
[[File: eddiehinkle_archive_page.png|400px]]
* Eddie has [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/10/17/ daily] archive pages that attempts to group similar information into common categories and display data appropriately for it's purpose. (Watch, Listen and Photo posts just display images that link back to their original post, Ate and Drank posts get gathered together into meals, etc).
* [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/10/ monthly] archive pages are currently just a stream of posts that looks just like a channel or tag page, but it shows posts that happened in that month. I would like to expand this to be more like the daily archive pages.

=== fluffy ===

{{fluffy}} has a very flexible set of archive pages, which is core to [[Publ CMS|Publ]]'s design.

All indexes are browseable by date and by offset-based pagination. Most pages on beesbuzz.biz use offset pagination by default (and don't provide UX for switching to date-based), but the [https://beesbuzz.biz/comics comics section] provides an easy means of switching between individual, daily, weekly, and monthly archives, and the [https://beesbuzz.biz/art/drawings/inktober Inktober section] defaults to year-based pagination. (See also the [https://novembeat.com/works Novembeat works page], which runs on the same website platform.)

This also extends to the [[Atom]] feeds, which provide [[RFC5005]] archive tags to allow for a complete content index via Atom.

=== {{gwg}} ===

{{gwg}} uses the built-in WordPress functionality to generate date based, taxonomy based, and post kind/type based archives. He has extended this to include an archive for:
* [[on_this_day]]
* Date Based Archives for Post Kinds
* Adding /map to many archives will redisplay all posts with a location and show a map.
* Pairing a category and a kind... all posts of this type with this tag

== Brainstorming ==

=== Order ===

Recently, {{gwg}} contemplated the way posts in an archive should be ordered. Traditionally, h-entry content has been ordered newest to oldest. But, for date-based archives, it may make sense to order them from oldest to newest, as a date based archive is a form of narrative where the posts should go chronologically.
