{{stub}}

'''<dfn>advertising</dfn>''' is a common [[business-model]] for websites, especially [[silos]], but also on some IndieWeb sites.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* zeldman uses [[The Deck]] to serve ads
* daringfireball uses ???
* {{aaronpk}} uses ethicalads.io

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] uses their own ad system.

Example ad for example.com:

== Criticism ==
=== Ad models can be exploitative ===
Advertising based business models are to be avoided as they are exploitative.
* See: http://blog.whatsapp.com/index.php/2012/06/why-we-dont-sell-ads/

Counter argument: 

Nonetheless many companies who provide a "free" service, are actually ad-based businesses
* Most [[silos]]
* All known [[aggregators]]
* All known general web [[search]] engines

=== May cause UX failure ===
Lazy loading ads which reflow the page (i.e. an ad at the top that doesn't take up space to begin with to avoid an awkward blank area at the top of the page) can cause UI elements to move and thus may result in the user clicking on something they did not intend to. E.g. (likely artificially constructed example for illustrative purposes)
