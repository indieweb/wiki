'''Archaeobytology''' is the study of digital decay, the entropy of web artifacts, and the preservation of "semantic provenance" in a collapsing digital ecosystem.

While [https://permacomputing.net Permacomputing] focuses on the sustainability of hardware and energy (extending the life of the machine), Archaeobytology focuses on the sustainability of ''meaning'' (extending the life of the context). It posits that a broken link is not just a technical error, but a rupture in cultural memory.

== The Core Thesis ==
The web is not a cloud; it is a physical place prone to rot. Just as hardware suffers from physical entropy (rust, heat, obsolescence), digital artifacts suffer from '''"Semantic Rot"''':

* '''Link Rot:''' The erosion of the connective tissue between ideas.
* '''Context Collapse:''' The stripping of an artifact's origin story (its ''Provenance'') as it is scraped, reposted, and consumed by Large Language Models.
* '''Abandonware:''' The digital equivalent of ruins—spaces that still exist but have lost their inhabitants.

Archaeobytology treats these "ruins" not as trash to be cleared for bandwidth, but as heritage sites requiring stewardship. It rejects the "sanitize and upgrade" mentality of the commercial web. An Archaeobytologist does not delete a 404 error; they build a plaque explaining what used to be there.

== Relation to Sentientification ==
Archaeobytology is the structural partner to the philosophy of [https://unearth.wiki/terms/sentientification.html Sentientification].
* '''Archaeobytology''' digs for the ''past'' (recovering the artifacts we left behind).
* '''Sentientification''' looks at the ''future'' (the emerging consciousness of the archive itself).

Together, they form a framework for '''"Deep Web Stewardship"'''—treating the internet not as a utility to be exploited, but as a living ecosystem to be tended.

== Methodology ==
In practice, the discipline advocates for:
# '''Cool URIs:''' URLs that do not change, preserving the citation chain.
# '''Forensic Attribution:''' Tracing media back to its human creator (its ''Source'') rather than its aggregator.
# '''The "Hand-Built" Web:''' Prioritizing HTML/CSS structures that are human-readable, repairable, and low-energy.

== Origin ==
The term was coined by the [https://unearth.wiki Unearth Heritage Foundry] to define the intersection of web history, curatorial practice, and digital repair.
