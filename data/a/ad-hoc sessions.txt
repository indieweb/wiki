'''<dfn>ad-hoc sessions</dfn>''' is the idea (which needs a better name) that we host single topic sessions every month or two online that the community can gather around and discuss.

== Future Topics ==
Add a suggested topic below or +1 an existing topic. When there seems to be a topic with a decent amount of interest we can plan an ad-hoc session.

* Discovery
** +1 {{eddiehinkle}}


== How to plan a session ==
* The general idea for the best time for these sessions are Saturday afternoon/evening UTC.
* Session must be announced more than a week before it's supposed to take place.
** More specifically, it has to be in the newsletter that goes out (on Fridays) the week before the announced session.

** "I'd go for "announce it before the newsletter friday for the weekend of the next week, sometime saturday afternoon/evening UTC" - but of course, if someone prefers something else and does it then, that's fine too. doing something wins over talking about when to do it :D" [http://www.svenknebel.de @sknebel] March 10, 2019
