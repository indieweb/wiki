'''<dfn>ad-hoc sessions</dfn>''' is the idea (which needs a better name) that we host single topic sessions every month or two online that the community can gather around and discuss.

== Future Topics ==
Add a suggested topic below or +1 an existing topic. When there seems to be a topic with a decent amount of interest we can plan an ad-hoc session.

* Discovery
** +1 {{eddiehinkle}}


== How to plan a session ==
* The general idea for the best time for these sessions are Saturday afternoon/evening UTC.
* Session must be announced more than a week before it's supposed to take place.
** More specifically, it has to be in the newsletter that goes out (on Fridays) the week before the announced session.

== Original concept ==
During IndieWebCamp [[2019/Online|Online 2019]] it was brainstormed that we should hold individual sessions that don't require as much overhead and preparation time but gets the benefit that was achieved in the Sessions of the camp. Some of the key concepts from chat that were discussed are archived below:

** "Given how the Online Camp is going, it wouldn't be a horrible idea to have an etherpad of general camp-esque topics that people are interested in and doing occasional online sessions for just them when they reach some sort of critical mass." [http://boffosocko.com @chrisaldrich] March 9, 2019

** "the ad-hoc sessions thing is also someting I thought of today, with someone proposing a "session" for the near future" [http://www.svenknebel.de @sknebel] March 9, 2019

** "not sure how much people actually use the newsletter to discover events, but maybe adding it to the newsletter the week before is a useful form (fridays newsletter for saturday is probably a bit short notice)" [http://www.svenknebel.de @sknebel] March 9, 2019

** "I'd go for "announce it before the newsletter friday for the weekend of the next week, sometime saturday afternoon/evening UTC" - but of course, if someone prefers something else and does it then, that's fine too. doing something wins over talking about when to do it :D" [http://www.svenknebel.de @sknebel] March 10, 2019
