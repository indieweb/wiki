"'''<dfn>About</dfn>'''" is a commonly occurring page or section on a site that describes who is behind the site and a summary or the purpose of the site. On a personal site, this would be usually be in the form of an expanded [[h-card]] about the person. About information can either be on a dedicated page, on every page (e.g. in a [[footer]]), or often on the site [[home page]].

The key part of the About is the <code>p-note</code> of the <code>h-card</code>, which attempts to introduce the site visitor to the person in a simple and plain manner. 

== Why ==

An about page or section is a single place to which you can point people who want to learn more about you.

You may choose to share your about page or section with:

* People you meet in-person with whom you want to keep in touch
* People who reach out to you and who are interested in learning more about your work
* Your friends and family

== About Section Guidelines ==
A good About <code>p-note</code> should be brief. There is always the opportunity to expand later. This is not a resume (that's what [[h-resume]] is for). This is to introduce people to the author and owner of the site.

An about section may link to a full about page (see About Page Brainstorming below) that talks about you and your history in more depth.

=== separate page ===
==== Jeena ====
{{jeena}} on https://jeena.net/about is the main h-card with all the detailed data which shouldn't be on the homepage because it is just too much.

==== Kartik ====
{{kartik}} on https://kartikprabhu.com/about#me is the main h-card with a <code>p-note</code> which reads -

"I think, discover, compute, make, build, code, design, write, paint, photograph, am! 

I study mathematical properties of black holes and their effects on other things in the Universe. I spend my spare time on photography and, sometimes, painting. I write short stories, and haikus on occasion. I am also excited by the wonderful ideas in web design, and play around with the them on this site."

There is a minimal h-card with photo and name in the footer of the site on all pages that links to the full one using <code>u-url u-uid</code>.

== About Page Brainstorming ==

An about page can contain any piece of information about you.

=== A bio ===

You can reserve your about page as a professional bio. This bio may contain information about your work history, your interests, and your hobbies.

=== Professional history ===

On your about page, you may want to share your professional history. This is different from a [[resume]], which uses a more structured approach. On an about page, you can talk about your professional history as if it were a story, rather than a list of accomplishments or bullet points.

=== Fun facts ===

An about page could share fun facts about who you are.

* {{jamesgoca}} shared a geek code (now on his home page) as a throwback to the 90's geek codes.

=== Downsides ===

About pages force you to sum up your life into words. Your view of what you have accomplished or dream about may change often which means that your about page may quickly become obsolete.

* {{jamesgoca}} removed his about page. He was changing the page too many times because he was unsure how to best present himself and his skillset.
