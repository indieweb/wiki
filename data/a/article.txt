An '''<dfn>article</dfn>''' is a kind of [[post]] that typically has more structure than a simple [[note]]. Articles usually have a name (title), multiple paragraphs, and often subheadings, blockquotes, and a footer of references or citations.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
__TOC__
There are plenty of examples of IndieWeb sites posting articles, as articles essentially represent what used to simply be called "blog posts".

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has been publishing articles using [[Nucleus]] since 2002-01-26:
* http://gregorlove.com/2002/01/1/
** At the time, I treated my site more like a journal and the design did not use titles for each post. In later years, I added default titles for entries missing them.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has been explicitly posting <em>articles</em> using [[Falcon]] on tantek.com since 2010-08-19, and before that with monthly static files and fragement ID permalinks [http://tantek.com/log/2002/08.html#L20020808t2345 since 2002-08-08]:

== Brainstorming ==
=== ID markup for paragraphs etc ===
Marking up paragraphs with unique id attributes may enable more granular referencing for quotations within them, and possibly more granular [[comments]] as well.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Blogger ===
Blogger introduced "titles" to blog posts in 1999? E.g.
* {{kevinmarks}} has https://epeus.blogspot.com

=== Facebook ===
In 2015 [[Facebook]] revamped its "Notes" feature to basically support [[Medium]]-like articles with titles, and minor style-editing.

=== Medium ===
[[Medium]] supports articles with a header image, a name, and minor style-editor.
