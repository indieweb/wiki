<span class="p-summary">An '''<dfn>article</dfn>''' is a kind of [[post]] that typically has more structure than a simple [[note]]. Articles usually have a name (title), multiple paragraphs, and often subheadings, blockquotes, embedded images, and a footer of references or citations.</span>

== How to mark up? ==
<code><pre><article class="h-entry">
  <h1 class="p-name">Microformats are amazing</h1>
  <p>Published by <a class="p-author h-card" href="http://example.com">W. Developer</a>
     on <time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-06-13 12:00:00">13<sup>th</sup> June 2013</time></p>
 
  <p class="p-summary">In which I extoll the virtues of using microformats.</p>
 
  <div class="e-content">
    <p>Blah blah blah</p>
  </div>
</article></pre></code>

The core difference to a [[note]] is that there is a title, marked up as <code>p-name</code>, that's different from the content.

If the article has embedded images or photos, where the photos are intended to be displayed interspersed with the text, then '''do not''' add the <code>u-photo</code> class to the images, as that will turn the article into a [[photo]] post.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
__TOC__
There are plenty of examples of IndieWeb sites posting articles, as articles essentially represent what used to simply be called "blog posts".

{{gRegor}} has been publishing articles using [[Nucleus]] since 2002-01-26:

== Brainstorming ==
=== ID markup for paragraphs etc ===
Marking up paragraphs with unique id attributes may enable more granular referencing for quotations within them, and possibly more granular [[comments]] as well.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Blogger ===
Blogger introduced "titles" to blog posts in 1999? E.g.
* {{kevinmarks}} has https://epeus.blogspot.com

=== Facebook ===
In 2015 [[Facebook]] revamped its "Notes" feature to basically support [[Medium]]-like articles with titles, and minor style-editing.

(screenshots needed - Tantek has some he should get around to uploading)

=== Medium ===
[[Medium]] supports articles with a header image, a name, and minor style-editor.
