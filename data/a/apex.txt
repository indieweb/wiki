The '''zone apex''' (sometimes '''"root" domain''') is the part of [[DNS]] that contains an the [[SOA]] and [[NS record]]s for a DNS zone.  If you have a site www.example.com, then then the apex is example.com.  The www. portion might be a dedicated host (or load balancer) for serving Web traffic (as opposed to other Internet services.  Sites served with a [[naked domain]] are not permitted to have an [[A record]] at the apex, because this is forbidden by DNS.  Some DNS providers, such as CloudFlare, give the appearance of support for CNAME at the apex by simulating it by "CNAME flattening", which accepts a CNAME in the configuration panel ''as if'' it were allowed, but silently serves up an A record with the correct IP for DNS queries.  Some providers might also call this an ALIAS record, which is not a real DNS record, but the name for the placeholder which uses the same strategy.
