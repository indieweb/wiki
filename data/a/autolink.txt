{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>autolink</dfn>''' is a hyperlink that was automatically added to some text to link that text to an obvious or useful destination, like hyperlinking a URL in plaintext to the URL itself, linking [[hashtags]] to search results, and @-names to their profile pages.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} posts plain text [[notes]] on tantek.com which are autolinked (URLs, @-names) with the CASSIS <code>auto_link</code> function [http://tantek.com/2010/047/t1/links-cassis-auto_link-idempotent-apache-licensed since 2010-02-16].

=== Hans Gerwitz ===
{{gerwitz}} renders notes with a Markdown processor that autolinks URLs for him at publish-time, but intends to implement view-time after suffering the pain of importing thousands of pre-processed notes from Twitter.

=== ... many more ... ===
Feel free to add your site if you also support posting of [[notes]] with autolinking, and note since when.

== Open Source ==
See [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function for a fairly good (and [[selfdogfood]]ed) open source autolink implementation for [[PHP]]&amp;[[JS]].

== Silo Examples ==
Most [[silos]] autolink URLs, some autolink hashtags &amp; @-names as well ([[Twitter]], [[Instagram]]).

== On Publish Or View ==
It deserves consideration whether autolinking is applied at the time of publishing or the time of viewing.

In favor of publish-time:
* process once
* preserve author intent

In favor of view-time 
* adapt to changing link targets
* allow for user preferences (e.g. what site should a #hashtag or @username link to?)

== Brainstorming ==
New ideas for autolinking to consider implementing.
=== Flight status and tracking ===
Flight codes could be [[auto-link]]ed to the current (today's?) flight using two letter airline code and flight number e.g. (without requiring JS)
* https://mobile.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/UA/2055
Or for a specific date by appending /YYYY/MM/DD to the end e.g.:
* https://mobile.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/UA/2055/2019/06/24

Live [[flight]] info with map (requires JS): [[FlightAware]] links can be automatically constructed from flight codes! E.g.
* Flight code: UA59
* Link to live status / map: https://flightaware.com/live/flight/UA59
* Useful if you know the flight is happening (via external information, or retrieval of 

Reference:
* Airline codes (IATA two letter, and three letter) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_codes
* flight numbers seem to be 1-4 digits (0-9).

Regex:
* Could probably construct a regex of 2-3 airline codes (uppercase only) followed by (optional space) followed by 1-4 digits (0-9)
