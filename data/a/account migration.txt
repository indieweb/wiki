'''<dfn>account migration</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>account portability</dfn>, or the ability to <dfn>move your account</dfn>) is a specific kind of [[migration]] when a user switches from using one account on a particular server to using another account on another server, typically when both servers host multiple accounts, and has the common problem of [[losing followers]].

== Examples ==
