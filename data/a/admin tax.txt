'''<dfn>admin tax</dfn>''' is all the time you spend <em>maintaining</em> your personal site, rather than actually <em>using</em> it (like to [[create]] [[posts]]). Note that the list of things considered an admin tax does not mean they are not worth doing, just that it's important to consider the time and cost associated with doing them.

== Examples ==
Examples of admin tax:
=== Content related admin ===
* removing [[spam]]
* [[block]]ing spammers
__TOC__
=== Periodic required tasks ===
* renewing your [[domain name]]s
* renewing [[https admin tax|https]] certificates
* paying bills (for [[web hosting]], [[domain registrar]]s)

=== Database maintenance ===
* [[DBA tax]]

=== Software maintenance ===
* updating server software in general
* '''[[Mastodon]]''' servers in particular: https://twitter.com/NotE0157H7/status/1347998632612491264
** "A big part of it is that you basically have to have internet poisoning to run a server/instance. It requires a fair amount of technical skill and it also requires you to have resources to pay for hosting and such." [https://twitter.com/NotE0157H7 @NotE0157H7] January 9, 2021
* '''[[Rails]]''': https://twitter.com/mislav/status/1301508711005982726
** "I needed to make a small change to my hobby Rails app I was maintaining since 2009. Web development is easy, so how hard could it be?<br><br>Famous last words, as it turns out. (thread)" [https://mislav.net @mislav] September 3, 2020

=== Mental attention and labor ===

== Other Examples ==
Personal equipment / tools but not necessarily related to a personal website:

** "I used to be a member of social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Flickr, etc. But I felt guilty because I didn't run my own servers. [â€¦] So I've not been able to post much on social since I started studying for a Phd in Computer Science." (NB. the cited "goat farming" analogy)

** "I think people seriously underestimate the frictional costs of things like that. So many personal blogs disappeared over the years, server by server as people forgot, got busy, or died." [https://chris.improbable.org @acdha] April 21, 2022
* 2022-10-06 [https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/ mastodon.technology Shutdown] <blockquote>This made me realize how little joy Iâ€™ve been getting from being an admin. How Iâ€™ve come to resent the work I have volunteered to do. Iâ€™ve donated countless hours to running the instance, solving both technical and moderation problems, and Iâ€™ve always put the instance above my own needs. <br/>â€¦<br/>The server has also gotten too large and too complex for me to administer. Iâ€™ve always been keen to learn the next new skill I need to be an effective admin. But I just donâ€™t have it in me anymore. The monitoring that I have in place is insufficient to solve the current problems and I have zero bandwidth to invest in learning the skills to diagnose and fix the issue.</blockquote>
