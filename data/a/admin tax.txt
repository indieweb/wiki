'''<dfn>admin tax</dfn>''' is all the time you spend <em>maintaining</em> your personal site, rather than actually <em>using</em> it (like to [[create]] [[posts]]). Note that the list of things considered an admin tax does not mean they are not worth doing, just that it's important to consider the time and cost associated with doing them.

Examples of admin tax:
* [[DBA tax]]
* renewing your [[domain name]]s
* renewing [[https admin tax|https]] certificates
* paying bills (for [[web hosting]], [[domain registrar]]s)
* updating software
* removing [[spam]]
* [[block]]ing spammers
* ...
