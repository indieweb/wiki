'''<dfn>Academic samizdat</dfn>''' is the act of publishing one's academic work on one's own website (generally making it freely available) while it also appears in a for-profit publication (functioning like a [[silo]]) which often charges an exorbitant rate for individual downloads of the same content.

It's an extension of the subversive [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat Russian concept of samizdat] into academe. Vladimir Bukovsky summarized it as follows: "Samizdat: I write it myself, edit it myself, censor it myself, publish it myself, distribute it myself, and spend jail time for it myself."

Typically major publishers in the academic journal space frown on this practice (some forbid it outright contractually) as they feel it cuts into their profits, but generally the (search) structure of the overall system is such that it doesn't have a heavy effect on their overall sales and the practice is tolerated.

By comparison, and primarily for search and discoverability, it's becoming somewhat more common for many academics to also publish their work in progress on preprint servers (like [https://arxiv.org/ arXiv], [http://biorxiv.org/ bioarxiv], etc.) for comments and reactions prior to their being published by a larger academic publisher. In these cases, it's also common for the article to have already been accepted by a major publisher. While these pre-print servers are usually non-profit organizations which allow authors more access and latitude in editing and changing their content, they still don't provide the freedom and flexibility that publishing on one's own site first does.

Ideally, one should publish on one's own site, and then [[POSSE]] to pre-print servers, and then to research journals or other publishing platforms.

=== Tom Leinster ===
Tom Leinster's introductory textbook ''Basic Category Theory'' was published by [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/basic-category-theory?format=HB Cambridge University Press] in 2014. By arrangement with them, itâ€™s now also free online https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375 (free copy on pre-print server). Sadly, he doesn't self-host a copy on [http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/bct/ his own site] but does point out that the arXiv version is freely editable. So, for instance, you can alter it to suit the needs of a course you are teaching or a device you are reading on.

=== Zeynep Tufekci ===
Zeynep Tufekci negotiated with Yale to [http://technosociology.org/?p=1751 allow her to self-host] a free Creative Commons version of her book <em>Twitter and Tear Gas</em>:
<blockquote>...there will be a free creative commons copy of my book. It will be available as a free PDF download in addition to being sold as a bound book. This is with the hopes that anyone who wants to read it can do so without worrying about the cost. However, this also means that I need to ask that a few people who can afford to do so to please consider purchasing a copy. This is not just so that Yale University Press can do this for more authors, but also because if it is not sold (at least a little bit!) in the initial few weeks, bookstores will not stock it and online algorithms will show it to fewer people. No sales will mean less visibility, and less incentive for publishers to allow other authors creative commons copies.<br/><br/>

I negotiated the creative commons copy with my (wonderful!) publisher Yale University Press because I really wanted to do what I could to share my insights as broadly as I could about social movements and the networked public sphere. If I make a penny more from this book because it sells well by some miracle, I will donate every extra penny to groups supporting refugees, and if I ever meet you in person and you purchased a copy of the book in support, please let me know and Iâ€™ll buy the coffee or beer. ðŸ˜€ This isnâ€™t at all about money for me.</blockquote>

== Open Access Discovery ==
* [http://unpaywall.org/ Unpaywall.org] has created a browser extension that allows one to read paywalled research papers for free. On a paywall site it presents a green tab allowing one to skip the paywall by utilizing a free and legal database of millions of author-uploaded PDFs. See article about this and related tech at [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/04/04/announcing-unpaywall-unlocking-openaccess-versions-of-paywalled-research-articles-as-you-browse/ Announcing Unpaywall: unlocking #openaccess versions of paywalled research articles as you browse].
