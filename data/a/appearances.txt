'''<dfn>appearances</dfn>''' is a [[page]] on some IndieWeb sites that lists external pages and media that mention or include the author or something they created in some form, by name, image or other likeness, an interview or quotes therefrom, photos or other media by the author perhaps as part of larger piece of content such as a news article.

If youâ€™re looking for the general topic of ''appearance'' (of web sites & pages), see:
* '''[[design]]'''

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}}: https://aaronparecki.com/appearances and also https://aaronparecki.com/tag/press
* {{t}} has a page of interviews at: http://tantek.com/w/TantekInterviews (redirects to / hosted on [[PBWorks]])

== Silo Examples ==
* {{t}} uses a "press" [[tag]] on his photos posted on [[Flickr]] to show a list of his Creative Commons licensed photos that have been published in online press articles: https://flickr.com/photos/tantek/tags/press

=== How to organize ===
What are good ways to organize the items on an appearances page?

Timeline:
* Strictly date-time / timeline? 
* Most recent first or oldest first?

Clustered by type of appearance then time-ordered? E.g.
* interviews
* talks given
* use of photos in publications
* quotes/references in publications

Do different media/events or significance deserve different lists? E.g.

Talks:
* in-person talks vs online talks (webinars?)
* lightning / Ignite talks vs 45-90 minute talks vs longer masterclasses or workshops?
* keynote talks vs parallel track talks
* clustered by conferences then timeline ordered, or a timeline of all talks across conferences

Type vs medium:
* podcast interview vs podcast guest (panelist)

Interviews:
* audio/video interviews separate from written interviews
* podcast (as part of a series of interviews of other people) appearances separate from a standalone audio/video interview
* "continuous" / conversational (or edited to seem)
* disjoint Q&A style but still with complete / relatively unedited whole sentences/paragraphs
* excerpts / rephrased sentences or sentence fragments
* solo, or as part of a small group, or interspersed with others
* incidentally as part of or to help substantiate a larger article or book

Media:
* print media vs online news articles
* books vs magazines vs newspapers
* links to your site 
* links to specific pages
* only name mention
* only a photo of you
* embedding of a photo that you took


Possible approaches:
* Maybe keep track of all appearances with all such attributes in a collection, then use that to curate a particular presentation on an <code>/appearances</code> page.
