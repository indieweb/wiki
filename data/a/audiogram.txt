An '''<dfn>audiogram</dfn>''' is a video clip where the primary content is the audio, and is accompanied by a visual aspect, usually a graphical representation of the waveform, the text of what is being spoken, or a still photo of the person speaking. The term "audiogram" in this context was coined by New York Public Radio.
