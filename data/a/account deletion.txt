    '''<dfn>account deletion</dfn>''' is a common feature on [[silos]] and other services that allows a user to request that their [[account]] and information on the service be deleted and closed. 

Sometimes these requests come from outside the service itself, like: 
* https://twitter.com/mdvfunes/status/793771622847176704
** "@withknown Help? I am trying to delete my free site https://mdvfunes.withknown.com<br>Can you help? Fine to delete as is. TY" [http://marianafun.es @mdvfunes] November 2, 2016
