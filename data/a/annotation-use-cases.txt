'''<dfn>annotation use cases</dfn>''' are a list of common use-cases for [[annotations]] as presented by Robert of the W3C Annotations Working Group at the 2015-10-28 Web Annotations session at [[TPAC2015]], most of which have IndieWeb equivalents in practice.

== Use Cases ==

* Note which of the above correspond to which use-case in that NOTE by specific section number and link to it.
