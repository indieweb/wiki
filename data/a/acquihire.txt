An '''<dfn>acquihire</dfn>''' is a reasonably solid indicator of a future [[site-deaths|site-death]] of the company being acquired and therefore a good early warning signal for [[export|exporting]] your data if you want to keep it. 

In business terms, an acquihire is an act/instance of one company (typically a [[silo]]) buying out another company primarily for the skills and expertise of its staff rather than for the products or services it supplies.

Depending on the business deal at hand, announcements of acquihires can often be accompanied by the acquihired firm's post about "[[incredible_journey|Our incredible journey]]" and an almost immediate shutdown of the company's site which doesn't allow any data export.
