{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>alias</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb could be a nickname, often unrelated to an actual name, perhaps used as a [[username]] on [[silo]]s or [[chat-names]], or possibly a DNS [[ALIAS record]].

Aliases on [[IRC]] are called [[nick]]s.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
A handful of active community members have aliases not visually obviously connected to their names (but listed in [[chat-names]] or with a <nowiki>{{ }}</nowiki> chatname Template) that they use fairly consistently in chat (and sometimes as usernames on silos). In alphabetical order:
* '''artlung''' — {{artlung}}
* '''Fractalkitty''' — {{fractalkitty}} (Sophia)
* '''GWG''' — {{gwg}}
* '''snarfed''' — {{snarfed}}
* ...

Please do not add aliases to this list of people who have chosen to remain [[pseudonymous]] and have not linked their alias(es) to an actual name.

Got an obscure alias and don't see your name here? Rather than adding yourself to this list, start with:
# active participation in [[discuss]]ion channels
# add yourself to [[chat-names]]
# [[Tutorial-set-up-your-personal-wiki-template|set up a personal wiki template]]

There are many others in [[chat-names]] which are only incidentally related to people’s names.
