{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>alias</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb could be a nickname, often unrelated to an actual name, perhaps used as a [[username]] on [[silo]]s or [[chat-names]], or possibly a DNS [[ALIAS record]].

Aliases on [[IRC]] are called [[nick]]s.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
A handful of active community members have aliases not obviously connected to their names that they use fairly consistently in chat (and sometimes as usernames on silos). In alphabetical order:
* '''artlung''' — {{artlung}}
* '''Fractalkitty''' — {{fractalkitty}} (Sophia)
* '''GWG''' — {{gwg}}
* '''snarfed''' — {{snarfed}}
* ...

Got an obscure alias and don't see your name here? Start by participating in [[discuss]]ion channels (rather than adding yourself).

There are many others in [[chat-names]] which are only incidentally related to people’s names.

== Notable Examples ==
Notable examples of other aliases which have been used or mentioned in IndieWeb chat (or had to be explained more than once)
* '''<span id="pmarca">pmarca</span>''' — online alias for [[Marc Andreessen]]
* ...

* [[username]]
* [[gregors karma alias]]
