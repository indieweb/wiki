'''<dfn>archive navigation</dfn>''' is [[UI]] specifically for [[navigation|navigating]] [[archives]], often organized by time period.

== Why ==
See [[navigation#Why]] and [[archives#Why]].

== How ==
See existing examples, IndieWeb and others for ideas on how to design and implement your own archive navigation.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(please add some, preferably with screenshots!)

== Past Examples ==
Examples of old pages, or old versions
* Anil Dash’s blog had a grid of months and years in the footer of each post, along with an "archives" page, until 2014
** https://web.archive.org/web/20140721040909/http://dashes.com/anil/archives.html

== Silo Examples ==
=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]]’s contribution activity graph (screenshot needed) visible on every GitHub profile is quite nice in terms of how much information it presents in a neat and orderly manner, using the x axis for week number, y axis for day of the week, and darkness of green for density of activity on a particular day.

=== Facebook ===

[[Facebook]]'s activity log on https://mbasic.facebook.com allows you to select months in the current year and all years

== Brainstorming ==
=== Slack activity ===
The Slack activity display sent in email updates to Slack team owners provides an interesting approach that could be used to show and provide archive navigation:
