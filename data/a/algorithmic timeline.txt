'''<dfn>algorithmic timeline</dfn>''' (sometimes <dfn>non-chronological timeline</dfn>) is a doublespeak phrase propagated by [[silo]]s (and some popular media) to refer to social media [[algorithmic feed]] feature(s), as a '''timeline''' is "a display of a list of events '''in chronological order'''"<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline</ref>, whereas [[silo]]s now (since 2016+) use "timeline" to refer to often '''out of chronological order''' display of aggregations of following's posts which still presentationally resemble previous chronologically ordered displays.

It's doublespeak because people associate use of the term "timeline" with actual chronological order ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline see consistent examples on Wikipedia, definition etc.]), and yet they are defining it to be something else instead ("relevance" etc.) that breaks chronological order, thus trying get people to accept a definition of contradictory opposites.

This appears to be a deliberate deception (lie) because what they used to call a timeline was chronologically ordered, and when they changed it to not be chronologically ordered, instead of explicitly switching to a new term like feed as in [[algorithmic feed]], they explicitly chose to keep "timeline" and add the "algorithmic" qualifier to it:

The company was introducing what insiders called an '''“algorithmic timeline.”''' It meant that tweets would no longer appear in the order they were posted.</blockquote>
Eventually Twitter went full doublethink and dropped the "algorithmic" qualifier entirely:
