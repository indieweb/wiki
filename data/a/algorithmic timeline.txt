'''<dfn>algorithmic timeline</dfn>''' is a doublespeak lie propagated by [[silo]]s to refer to their [[algorithmic feed]] feature(s), as a '''timeline''' is "a display of a list of events '''in chronological order'''"<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline</ref>, whereas [[silo]]s now (since 2016+) use "timeline" to refer to often '''out of chronological order''' display of aggregations of following's posts which still presentationally resemble previous chronologically ordered displays.

It's doublespeak because people associate use of the term "timeline" with actual chronological order ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline see consistent examples on Wikipedia, definition etc.]), and yet they are defining it to be something else instead ("relevance" etc.) that breaks chronological order, thus trying get people to accept a definition of contradictory opposites.

It's a lie because what they used to call a timeline was chronologically ordered, and when they changed it to not be chronologically ordered, instead of explicitly switching to a new term like feed as in [[algorithmic feed]], they explicitly chose to keep "timeline" and add the "algorithmic" qualifier to it, eventually going full doublethink and dropping the "algorithmic" qualifier entirely:
