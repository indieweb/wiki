{{stub}}

'''<dfn>algorithmic timeline</dfn>''' is a doublethink lie propagated by [[silo]]s, as a timeline is "a display of a list of events in chronological order" (Wikipedia), whereas [[silo]]s now (since 2016+) use the term "timeline" to refer to their feature displaying aggregations of posts from followings that are often chronologically out of order, but still resemble their previous chronologically ordered display.
