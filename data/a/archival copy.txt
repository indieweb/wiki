{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>archival copy</dfn>''' is a copy of a web page made (often by someone other than the author) at a particular point in time, that can be used as a reference if the original disappears or is temporarily unavailable.

Archival copies are sometimes called "archives" for short, however in the context of independent publishing, the term "[[archive]]" is specifically used to refer to personal historical archives and the navigation to use them on a personal site.[http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Archive_Index][https://movabletype.org/documentation/administrator/publishing/archive-mapping.html][https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/43708?hl=en##archive]

== Why? / Use cases ==
# Store '''HTML''' to parse the microformats in the page to render comments and reply context [https://indieweb.org/indiearchive#Aaron_Parecki]
# Store '''screenshot''' of page to preserve how a page looked like, without needing to store all related files (CSS, JavaScript, images)

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Chris Aldrich ===
In late December 2016, with the help of [http://www.pressforward.org PressForward] a [[WordPress]] plugin, I began self-archiving [[read]] posts and am contemplating doing the same with [[bookmark]] posts on a selective basis. ([http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/31/pressforward-as-an-indieweb-wordpress-based-rss-feed-reader-pocketinstapaper-replacement/ Additional details])

I also use the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-archival/ Post Archival plugin] for [[WordPress]] to create additional backups of my content and content to which I link.

=== Savemy.News ===
[http://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/ Ben Walsh] of the LA Times Data Desk has created a simple web interface at [http://www.savemy.news/ www.SaveMy.News] that [[Indieweb_for_Journalism|journalists]] can use to archive their stories to The [[Internet Archive]] and [http://webcitation.org/ WebCite]. One can log into the service via Twitter and later download a .csv file with a running list of all their works with links to the archived copies.
