{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>archival copy</dfn>''' is a copy of a web page made (often by someone other than the author) at a particular point in time, that can be used as a reference if the original disappears or is temporarily unavailable.

Archival copies are sometimes called "archives" for short, however in the context of independent publishing, the term "[[archive]]" is specifically used to refer to personal historical archives and the navigation to use them on a personal site.[http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Archive_Index][https://movabletype.org/documentation/administrator/publishing/archive-mapping.html][https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/43708?hl=en##archive]

== Why? / Use cases ==
# Store '''HTML''' to parse the microformats in the page to render comments and reply context [https://indieweb.org/indiearchive#Aaron_Parecki]
# Store '''screenshot''' of page to preserve how a page looked like, without needing to store all related files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
