{{stub}}
'''<dfn>Anonymity</dfn>''' is the ability to disconnect your online actions (including publishing posts, making edits, chatting) from the requirement to identify yourself with your actual name, and may include having a different identity across different interactions (unlike [[pseudonymity]] which usually involves a single identity across the majority of interactions). 

== How to ==
=== Register a domain ===
It is possible, with many domain registries, to establish an anonymous domain that does not require accurate data, select a private domain registration, and purchasing domains using pre paid credit cards.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are number of folks using [[pseudonymous]] identities, but obviously itâ€™s not possible to link to a truly anonymous identity.

The IndieWeb community provides a number of tools to allow community members to participate anonymously:
* '''https://chat.indieweb.org/''' can be used to enter an one-off custom name and participate in chat
** Similarly, IRC clients allow you to choose your own IRC nickname, which you can change every time if you like.
* '''[https://commentpara.de Comment Parade]''' can be used to send [[webmentions]].

Caveat:
* Note that many interactions that may seem anonymous, e.g. with different names on https://chat.indieweb.org/ web interface, due to how the Internet works, your IP (Internet Protocol) address may be logged (e.g. in web server logs) which could be used to associate or correlate different identities.

== Levels of Anonymity ==
* Anonymous - i.e. there's no way you're going to find out who I am
* Pseudo-anonymous - i.e. you don't know who I am unless you do a bit of digging and cross-referencing
* Obfuscated - i.e. it's public but you'd have to guess the URL to get in there
* Public - i.e. you can see everything, including who I am

== Benefits ==
* Anominity online protects vulnerable populations. The real name policy on [[Facebook]], for example, has caused harm in the trans community.
* teenagers like to try on multiple online identities
* Anonymous venting can provide a cathartic release

== Criticism ==
* Anonymous platforms lead to increased bullying and harassment [http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/8378/]. Many apps like YikYak and Secret shut down after creating toxic communities
* Some have suggested harassment leads to teen suicide following cases such as [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/jamey-rodemeyer-suicide-ny-police-open-criminal-investigation/story?id=14580832] and [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/8653867/Teenager-in-rail-suicide-was-sent-abusive-message-on-social-networking-site.html]
