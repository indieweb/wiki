{{stub}}

'''<dfn>autocomplete</dfn>''' is when a text field provides options based on the existing text entered, sometimes providing default options when no text is entered, this is particularly relevant in the context of [[Micropub]] apps.

There seems to be a need for autocomplete queries for [[Micropub]] clients for use cases such as: @-mentions and categories. Other post type attributes could also be helpful such as place names of past [[checkins]] or [[venue cache]], food or drink names from [[ate]] and [[drank]] posts, and potentially other options.
