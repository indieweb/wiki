{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>auto-tag</dfn>''' function is code that detects plain text [[tags]] (typically [[hashtag]]s) and automatically marks up them with [[microformats]] tagging markup as a <code>p-category</code> in one's [[notes]], [[photos]], and [[reply]] posts.

== Why ==
Writing plain text (typically inline in content) hashtags are much more popular than any formal tagging / categorizing system, thus it makes sense to provide a function that detects plain text hashtags and formally marks them up for at a minimum consumption by parsers explicitly looking for tags/categories, and possibly even [[auto-link]]ing them to hashtag aggregation pages.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has an experimental "auto_tag" function he uses to convert
* #hashtag to <code>#&lt;span class="p-category auto-tag"&gt;hashtag&lt;/span&gt;</code>

== Open Source ==
None yet.
