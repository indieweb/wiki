This page lists '''adoption blockers''', things currently getting in the way of more non-technical people being involved in the indieweb. Please expand this based on real life efforts at [[advocacy]], preferably with specific citations, rather than just a wishlist of features.

== Import From Silos ==
A lot of people have content in services like [[Tumblr]] and [[WordPress]] and are blocked on moving to the indieweb due to wanting/needing to import from them (citation needed). We need to work on making it easier to import that content into indie tools.

== Diversity ==
Despite being founded by two women ({{caseorganic}}, {{crystal}}) and two men ({{aaronpk}} {{t}}), the IndieWeb community is not very [[diversity|diverse]]: the majority of participants (as determined even just by [[IndieWebCamp]] and [[Homebrew Website Club]] photos) currently are people who are white, male, Western and English-speaking (per [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/log/today IRC logs]). 

While we actively try to be a [[code-of-conduct|positive and welcoming community]] for people of all races, genders, sexualities, religions and backgrounds, the community itself needs to become more diverse in order to prevent against groupthink, the psychological equivalent of [[monoculture]].
