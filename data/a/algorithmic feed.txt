'''<dfn>algorithmic feed</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>algorithm-driven feed</dfn> or just <dfn>algorithm feed</dfn>) is a more correct term for the "[[algorithmic timeline]]" lie, and an increasingly common feature on [[social media]] silos such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], where they show only some posts from your followings, as well as show some posts only hours or days after they were posted, thus not in chronological order.

[[Instagram]] has supported an algorithmic followings feed since 2016 when it was announced and a few months later rolled out to most users, presumably subsequently all users.
