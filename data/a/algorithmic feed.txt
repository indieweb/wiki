'''<dfn>algorithmic feed</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>algorithm-driven feed</dfn>, <dfn>algorithm feed</dfn>, <dfn>ranked feed</dfn>, or sometimes <dfn>personalized algorithm</dfn>) is a more correct term for the "[[algorithmic timeline]]" doublespeak, and a typical feature of [[social media]] silos such as [[Threads]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], where they show only some posts from your followings, some posts only hours or days after they‚Äôre posted, almost never in chronological order.

== How to turn off ==
=== Twitter chronological option ===
[[Twitter]] has an option for turning off the algorithmic feed and switching back to a chronological feed.

<blockquote>you can just toggle off the "Show me the best tweets" option in the settings menu if you don't want to see it at all.</blockquote>

One can also use a Twitter search query for <code>filter:follows -filter:replies</code> and click the "Latest" tab to get a non-algorithmic Twitter timeline somewhat similar to their original incarnation.

2018-09-17 The Verge reported that [https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17872276/twitter-algorithmic-timeline-settings-change-viral-tweet-response Twitter will soon let you switch between chronological and ranked feeds] and included a link to a [https://twitter.com/EmmaKinema/status/1041419623386644480 viral Tweet] about muting a variety of terms to be able to manually modify one's Twitter timeline. Some of these terms include:
* suggest_recap
* suggest_who_to_follow
* suggest_activity
* suggest_activity_tweet
* suggest_recycled_tweet_inline
* suggest_recycled_tweet
* suggest_grouped_tweet_hashtag 

=== Threads chronological view ===
Threads has a way to switch to a chronological timeline view, however it resets to the algorithmic feed upon closing and re-opening the app.

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] "has had some form of an algorithmic News Feed since 2011."<ref>https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/08/instagram-algorithm/</ref>

See [[Facebook Algorithm]]

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] started switching to an algorithmic feed in 2016 February.

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] has supported an algorithmic followings feed since 2016 when it was announced and a few months later rolled out to most users, presumably subsequently all users.

(are the posts are ordered chronologically or jump between minutes to hours ago?)</blockquote> '''Emphases''' added.


=== Linkedin ===

Linkedin's timeline has an algorithm that regularly shares posts from weeks ago in some kind of attempt to share the most engaging content or most engaged with content rather than a chronological feed or otherwise.
