{{stub}}

'''<dfn>algorithmic feed</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>algorithm-driven feed</dfn> or just <dfn>algorithm feed</dfn>) is a more correct term for the "[[algorithmic timeline]]" lie, and an increasingly common feature on [[social media]] silos such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], where they show only some posts from your followings, as well as show some posts only hours or days after they were posted, thus not in chronological order.

== How to turn off ==
So far only [[Twitter]] has an option for turning off the algorithmic feed and switching back to a chronological feed.
<blockquote>you can just toggle off the "Show me the best tweets" option in the settings menu if you don't want to see it at all.</blockquote>
