{{stub}}

'''<dfn>algorithmic feed</dfn>''' is a more correct term for the lie that is [[algorithmic timeline]], and an increasingly common feature on [[social media]] silos such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], where they show only some posts from your followings, as well as show some posts only hours or days after they were posted, thus not in chronological order.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Facebook]] - see [[Facebook Algorithm]]
