{{stub}}

'''<dfn>algorithmic feed</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>algorithm-driven feed</dfn> or just <dfn>algorithm feed</dfn>) is a more correct term for the "[[algorithmic timeline]]" lie, and an increasingly common feature on [[social media]] silos such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], where they show only some posts from your followings, as well as show some posts only hours or days after they were posted, thus not in chronological order.

== How to turn off ==
So far only [[Twitter]] has an option for turning off the algorithmic feed and switching back to a chronological feed.
<blockquote>you can just toggle off the "Show me the best tweets" option in the settings menu if you don't want to see it at all.</blockquote>

One can also use a Twitter search query for <code>filter:follows -filter:replies</code> and click the "Latest" tab to get a non-algorithmic Twitter timeline somewhat similar to their original incarnation.

2018-09-17 The Verge reported that [https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17872276/twitter-algorithmic-timeline-settings-change-viral-tweet-response Twitter will soon let you switch between chronological and ranked feeds] and included a link to a [https://twitter.com/EmmaKinema/status/1041419623386644480 viral Tweet] about muting a variety of terms to be able to manually modify one's Twitter timeline. Some of these terms include:
* suggest_recap
* suggest_who_to_follow
* suggest_activity
* suggest_activity_tweet
* suggest_recycled_tweet_inline
* suggest_recycled_tweet
* suggest_grouped_tweet_hashtag

[[Instagram]] has supported an algorithmic followings feed since 2016 when it was announced and a few months later rolled out to most users, presumably subsequently all users.
