{{stub}}

'''<dfn>auto-emoji</dfn>''' is creating or embedding [[emoji]] automatically from a text-based [[microsyntax]], usually the text name of the emoji delimited by colon ':' characters, like <code> `ðŸ˜„`</code> for ðŸ˜„ or custom names for custom emoji image embeds in some software and services, and some IndieWeb sites.

* IndieWeb Example: {{capjamesg}} has supported auto-emoji via emoji shortcodes [https://jamesg.blog/2021/10/25/reacjis/ since at least 2021-10-25], using his code https://github.com/capjamesg/cinnamon/blob/main/static/js/editor.js#L319 and reference shortcode dictionary https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908
* Services support: [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]]
* Hypothesis: the colon delimiting syntax came from auto-converting emoticons which often start with a ':' (like : ) or : D or : P ) into emoji.
* emoji shortcodes are their own [[microsyntax]] (see https://emojipedia.org/shortcodes) and are not actually part of [[Markdown]] (no mention of emoji in https://spec.commonmark.org/). They happen to be supported in many text-entry boxes, some of which also support Markdown (e.g. [[GitHub]]), and thus are mistakenly thought of as part of Markdown, or even part of [https://github.github.com/gfm/ GitHub Flavored Markdown], despite that spec also having no mention of emoji.
