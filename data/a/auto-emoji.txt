{{stub}}

'''<dfn>auto-emoji</dfn>''' is creating or embedding [[emoji]] automatically from a text-based [[microsyntax]], usually the text name of the emoji delimited by colon ':' characters, like <code> `ðŸ˜„`</code> for ðŸ˜„ or custom names for custom emoji image embeds in some software and services, and some IndieWeb sites.

* IndieWeb Example: {{capjamesg}} has supported auto-emoji via emoji shortcodes [https://jamesg.blog/2021/10/25/reacjis/ since at least 2021-10-25], using his code https://github.com/capjamesg/cinnamon/blob/main/static/js/editor.js#L319 and reference shortcode dictionary https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908
* Services support: [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]]
* Hypothesis: the colon delimiting syntax came from auto-converting emoticons which often start with a ':' (like : ) or : D or : P ) into emoji.
