'''<dfn>ai;dr</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence; Didn't Read, referring to text content that is presumed or stated to be generated by an AI (usually an LLM like ChatGPT) that one chooses to ignore, and is worth considering before using generated AI in blog posts or other places on your personal site.

== Brainstorming ==

* Should we publish statements on our blog when we publish text that was written by AI?
* How can we improve human-made content's visibility in search engine rankings for topics that are overrun by mediocre AI-generated posts?
* Considering that Google is going to use all the public information it scrapes for training their AI [https://gizmodo.com/google-says-itll-scrape-everything-you-post-online-for-1850601486 source], would it make more sense to think of a way to unearth human generated content without using the traditional search engines? We do already have some alternatives, like using [[link]], [[blogroll]], [[webring]], ...  Or do we not care about it and accept it as the price we need to pay (I hope not)? 
* What are the ways to avoid the AI generated content?
