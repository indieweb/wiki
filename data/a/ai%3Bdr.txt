{{stub}}

'''<dfn>ai;dr</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence; Didn't Read, referring to text content that is presumed or stated to be generated by an AI (usually an LLM like ChatGPT) that one chooses to ignore, and is worth considering before using generated AI in blog posts or other places on your personal site.

== Brainstorming ==

* Should we publish statements on our blog when we publish text that was written by AI?
* How can we improve human-made content's visibility in search engine rankings for topics that are overrun by mediocre AI-generated posts?
