'''<dfn>ai;dr</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence; Didn't Read, referring to text content that is presumed or stated to be generated by an AI (usually an [[LLM]] like [[ChatGPT]]) that one chooses to ignore, and is worth considering before using generated AI in blog posts or other places on your personal site.

2023-03-26 [https://marketoonist.com/2023/03/ai-written-ai-read.html AI Written, AI Read] <blockquote>One piece of slang that has long embodied the short attention span Internet age is TL;DR, short for “too long; didn’t read.”  With the explosion of generative AI tools, we’re rapidly entering the age of TL;DW: “too long, didn’t write.” </blockquote>

== Brainstorming ==
* Should we publish statements on our blog when we publish text that was written by AI?
* How can we improve human-made content's visibility in search engine rankings for topics that are overrun by mediocre AI-generated posts?
* Considering that Google is going to use all the public information it scrapes for training their AI [https://gizmodo.com/google-says-itll-scrape-everything-you-post-online-for-1850601486 source], would it make more sense to think of a way to unearth human generated content without using the traditional search engines? We do already have some alternatives, like using [[link]], [[blogroll]], [[webring]], ...  Or do we not care about it and accept it as the price we need to pay (I hope not)? 
* What are the ways to avoid the AI generated content?
