'''<dfn>ai;dr</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence; Didn't Read, referring to text content that is presumed or stated to be generated by an AI (usually an LLM like ChatGPT) that one chooses to ignore, and is worth considering before using generated AI in blog posts or other places on your personal site.
