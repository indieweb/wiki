{{stub}}

'''<dfn>alt</dfn>''' is a required attribute of the <code>&lt;img></code> element and should be provided in any use of images on indieweb pages from [[photo]] posts to [[featured]] and other images in [[articles]].

== Why ==
You should add descriptive alt text to all your [[photo]] posts and content images added to the wiki for at least a few use-cases:
* screenreader users
* text fallback for when images don't load (for whatever reason, network flakiness, content blocking, tracking blocking, etc.)
* ...

== How to ==
=== How to post photos with alt ===
(this section is a stub)

So far people are using the following tools to add alt text to their photos and other images:
* use [[Quill]] image posting UI with alt text field
* use [[WordPress]] image upload UI with alt text field
* write in plain text and put (parenthetical alt text) just after your image URL and use the latest [[CASSIS]] (https://tantek.com/cassis.js) to auto-embed the text + alt
* write in Markdown which has a [[#Markdown|syntax for adding alt text]]
* write in HTML, where you can directly add the <code>alt=</code> to an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.
* ... add yours here, after you've added yourself with permalinks to examples to the IndieWeb Examples section (no theoretical how-tos please!)

=== Wiki instructions ===
To add alt text to images in the IndieWeb wiki, use the following general syntax:

 <nowiki>[[File:Image_filename.PNG|center|alt=Put your desired alt text here]]</nowiki>

There is also a custom [[Template:photosrcalt|photosrcalt template]] that also includes a set up for easy inclusion of images with <code>u-photo</code> markup and alt text using the following format:

<pre style="line-height: 1.4em; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid #ddd; color: black; background-color: #f9f9f9;">{{photosrcalt|src=http://example.com/pic.jpg|alt=Photo of something awesome}}</pre>

More details on images in the wiki can be found here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Images

=== Guidelines ===
Summary guideline for the alt attribute: 
<div style="background:#EFE;border:solid 2px black">
* Use alt text that makes sense when read out loud along with the context of any text before, and any text after the image.
</div>

For more decent guidelines on good <code>alt</code> attribute authoring, see:
* https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#alt

Exception:
==== Caption Title Legend related ====
Exception: sometimes the WHATWG spec has bad or bad out-of-context advice, e.g. <blockquote style="background:#FEE;border:dashed 2px gray">"...the alt attribute's value should never contain text that could be considered the image's caption, title, or legend."[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#alt]</blockquote>

This is poor advice because:
* Using the phrase <em>should never</em> is "scare" advice (more likely to cause inaction than action)
* More likely to result in empty alt attributes than anything useful
* An empty string "" contains no "text that could be considered the image's caption, title, or legend", satisfies the WHATWG statement, yet adds little or no value.

Instead, see the summary guideline for positive guidance. In particular for this case:
<div style="background:#EFE;border:solid 2px black">
* Alt text may perfectly reasonably contain text that could be used or considered part of an image's caption, title, or legend. If such text is already present in the context of the text before or after the image, no need to duplicate the text. Instead, use alt to add information or an additional detail or two about what is actually in the image.
</div>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Rosemary Orchard ===
{{rose}}: I write in Markdown, and use the image description as the alt text, so ![alt text](image.ref).

* '''Example post permalink? Earliest post with an image with an alt? YYYY-MM-DD'''

=== Jeremy Cherfas ===
{{jeremycherfas}} I too write in Markdown for my site served by [[Grav]] and I too try to remember to add a verbal description of the image exactly as Rose (above) does. The Grav post composer automatically inserts (<code>![](link/to/image)</code>) making it easy to backspace and add the alt-text. When I write in [[Byword]] I generally remember the format, and I have a TextExpander snippet as backup, but seldom need to use it. 

* '''Example post permalink? Earliest post with an image with an alt? YYYY-MM-DD'''

=== Greg McVerry ===
{{jgmac1106}} When publishing on my main site I am often writing in HTML and use the alt text, most of my images are from the [https://cogdog.github.io/flickr-cc-helper/ Flickr CC Creative Commons Attribution] tool and include alt text. When I use [[Known]] the photo post type does not allow for the entering of alt text and the photo's title becomes the alt text [https://gist.github.com/jgmac1106/30c769bb41e690562e90d7fbc5340d15 Example]. Untitled photos get no alt-text. When publishing a post in [[Known]] you use the TinyMCE WYSIWIG and enter an image description. This image description becomes the alt text.
** When syndicating a photo post to Twitter the alt text does not translate and is left blank.
** If you serve a large screen reader population or are personally liable for maintaining accessibility standards you may want to consider this when choosing [[Known]] as a platform until these issues are resolved.

** These permalinks represent the "first" but the they do not indicate regularity. The majority of images from 2007-2019 were left without an alt. Regular inclusion did no occur until I had blind student in class and began to see how screen readers worked.

=== Chris Burnell ===
{{chrisburnell}}: I use the typical Markdown syntax (<code>![alt](src)</code>) for inline images. I have also recently set up some logic to parse a photo and alternate text defined in my postsâ€™ metadata ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.com/master/_posts/notes/2019-03-17-1552792631.md Example on GitHub]).

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}}: When publishing with [[WordPress]], I most often add images and media using the "add media" button which pops up a search/selection UI that includes an [[alt]] field to remind me to enter the appropriate alt text. If the alt text is left empty, the text editor automatically includes an empty <code>alt=""</code> as an explicit reminder that is required, but empty. Sadly the visual editor doesn't include any indication that the alt text either does or doesn't exist as a reminder to include it. It would also be nice if the alt text field in the UI was above the 'caption' field. For improved UI it would be nice if it indicated what alt text was and why it was important to get more people to include it for [[accessibility]]. The idea of [[alt]] just feels too much like [[jargon]] for the average person to know what it is or why it is important.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}}: When publishing with [[ProcessWire]], I usually insert images into posts using the rich text editor ([[CKEditor]]). The editor inserts a blank <code>alt=""</code> attribute by default. When I want to set alt text, I click "Source" to modify the HTML and update it manually.

{{t}}: Supports alt text on his image posts since 2019-078 (using latest deployed [[CASSIS]] auto_link), starting with adding alt text after the fact to his [https://tantek.com/2019/077/t1/sunset-crashing-waves-stained-glass most recent photo post the day before] adding alt text support.

=== Markdown ===
[[Markdown]] has syntax for adding alt text to an image embed.
* Image embed: <kbd><nowiki>![](http://w3.org/Icons/text.gif)</nowiki></kbd>
* With alt text: <kbd><nowiki>![text icon](http://w3.org/Icons/text.gif)</nowiki></kbd>

=== CASSIS auto_link ===
If you use the [[CASSIS]] auto_link function (latest deployed version), you can add alt text to your plain text content like this:
* embed an image:
** <kbd><nowiki>http://w3.org/Icons/text.gif</nowiki></kbd>
* image with alt: 
** <kbd><nowiki>http://w3.org/Icons/text.gif (text icon)</nowiki></kbd>
And similarly for a linked image with alt:
* hyperlink an image embed: 
** <kbd><nowiki>http://w3.org/Icons/text.gif http://indiewebcamp.com/text</nowiki></kbd>
* hyperlink image with alt: 
** <kbd><nowiki>http://w3.org/Icons/text.gif (text icon) http://indiewebcamp.com/text</nowiki></kbd>

== Issues ==
Alt text on images in a post can cause issues when trying to display that post in a [[reader]].

On adactio.com, the img alt text is the same as the post contents. Since alt text is included in the p-name parsed result, this results in duplicated text for the posts.

Below is a screenshot showing a few recent posts from adactio.com as rendered in an IRC-based reader.

[[File:adactio-posts-in-irc-reader.png|500px]]

Currently the python mf2 parser does not include alt text in the parsed result, so these posts look fine in [[Woodwind]]. However, if it did, as the parsing algorithm suggests, this is how a post would look. (with more representative alt text)

[[File:adactio-post-with-alt-text-in-woodwind.png|500px]]

Woodwind has no way of knowing the first line of the name property came from the alt text.

=== Resolved ===
Previous to 2019-078:

Below are two posts from tantek.com in the same reader. Note that the text of the first post includes "a jpg" which is the alt text of the image.

[[File:tantek-posts-in-irc-reader.png|500px]]

Resolution: Starting 2019-078, tantek.com supports showing alt text on images so now it just depends on the author taking the time to add them (parenthetically as it were) to each photo post moving forward (and perhaps adding alt to past photo posts incrementally).
