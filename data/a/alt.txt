{{stub}}

'''<dfn>alt</dfn>''' is a required attribute of the <code>&lt;img></code> element and should be provided in any use of images on indieweb pages from [[photo]] posts to [[featured]] and other images in [[articles]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== add yourself! ===
* {{rose}}: I write in Markdown, and use the image description as the alt text, so ![alt text](image.ref).
* {{jeremycherfas}} I too write in Markdown for my site served by [[Grav]] and I too try to remember to add a verbal description of the image exactly as Rose (above) does. The Grav post composer automatically inserts `![](link/to/image)` making it easy to backspace and add the alt-text. When I write in [[Byword]] I generally remember the format, and I have a TextExpander snippet as backup, but seldom need to use it. 
* {{jgmac1106}} When publishing on my main site I am often writing in HTML and use the alt text, most of my images are from the [https://cogdog.github.io/flickr-cc-helper/ Flickr CC Creative Commons Attribution] tool and include alt text. When I use [[Known]] the photo post type does not allow for the entering of alt text and the photos title becomes the alt text [https://gist.github.com/jgmac1106/30c769bb41e690562e90d7fbc5340d15 Example]. Untitled photos get no alt-text. When publishing a post in [Known] you use the TinyMCE WYSIWIG and enter an image description. This image description becomes the alt text.
** When syndicating a photo post to Twitter the alt text does not translate and is left blank.
** If you serve a large screen reader population or are personally liable for maintaining accessibility standards you may want to consider this when choosing [[Knownn]] as a platform until these issues are resolved.
* {{chrisburnell}}: I use the typical Markdown syntax (<code>![alt](src)</code>) for inline images. I have also recently set up some logic to parse a photo and alternate text defined in my postsâ€™ metadata ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.com/master/_posts/notes/2019-03-17-1552792631.md Example on GitHub]).

== Tools ==
[[Bridgy Publish]] supports publishing alt text to [[Twitter]] as of 2018-07-27. [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/756#issuecomment-408479810]
* Example: http://jgregorymcverry.com/6851-2/ ([http://web.archive.org/web/20180917231349/http://jgregorymcverry.com/6851-2/ archived]) -> https://twitter.com/jgmac1106/status/1041295971911696385

== Guidelines ==
Summary guideline for the alt attribute: 
<div style="background:#EFE;border:solid 2px black">
* Use alt text that makes sense when read out loud along with the context of any text before, and any text after the image.
</div>

For more decent guidelines on good <code>alt</code> attribute authoring, see:
* https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#alt

Exception:
=== Caption Title Legend related ===
Exception: sometimes the WHATWG spec has bad or bad out-of-context advice, e.g. <blockquote style="background:#FEE;border:dashed 2px gray">"...the alt attribute's value should never contain text that could be considered the image's caption, title, or legend."[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#alt]</blockquote>

This is poor advice because:
* Using the phrase <em>should never</em> is "scare" advice (more likely to cause inaction than action)
* More likely to result in empty alt attributes than anything useful
* An empty string "" contains no "text that could be considered the image's caption, title, or legend", satisfies the WHATWG statement, yet adds little or no value.

Instead, see the summary guideline for positive guidance. In particular for this case:
<div style="background:#EFE;border:solid 2px black">
* Alt text may perfectly reasonably contain text that could be used or considered part of an image's caption, title, or legend. If such text is already present in the context of the text before or after the image, no need to duplicate the text. Instead, use alt to add information or an additional detail or two about what is actually in the image.
</div>

== Issues ==
Alt text on images in a post can cause issues when trying to display that post in a [[reader]].

On adactio.com, the img alt text is the same as the post contents. Since alt text is included in the p-name parsed result, this results in duplicated text for the posts.

Below is a screenshot showing a few recent posts from adactio.com as rendered in an IRC-based reader.

Below are two posts from tantek.com in the same reader. Note that the text of the first post includes "a jpg" which is the alt text of the image.

Currently the python mf2 parser does not include alt text in the parsed result, so these posts look fine in Woodwind. However, if it did, as the parsing algorithm suggests, this is how a post would look. (with more representative alt text)

Woodwind has no way of knowing the first line of the name property came from the alt text.
