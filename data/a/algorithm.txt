== Social Media Examples ==
[[social media|Social media]] [[silo]] algorithms exploit users under the guise of being helpful but are actually designed to keep users on their sites, encouraging them to return to their sites, get their friends on their sites, all in the end goal of getting users to view and interact with as much [[advertising]] as often as possible.
