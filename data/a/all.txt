{{stub}}

'''<dfn>all</dfn>''' is a top level [[page]] on some personal sites that provides a [[composite stream]] of all kinds of [[posts]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}}: https://aaronparecki.com/all since ????-??-??
* {{benji}}: https://benji.dog/feed/all includes everything except [[unlisted]] and [[private]] posts.
* {{capjamesg}}: has a /all page that lists all of his blog posts. The posts are marked up with h-feed and h-entry. The page is designed specifically to make it easy for James to parse his blog posts for scripts he writes (mostly related to his website search engine).
** NB: Don't open the page on a mobile device or if you have a slow network connection; capjamesg's all page is very large.
