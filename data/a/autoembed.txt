{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>autoembed</dfn>''' is an embedding of media, typically of an image or video, that was automatically added from a URL to that media, to provide immediate viewing and or direct interaction with that media.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} posts plain text [[notes]] on tantek.com which autoembed direct links to images (GIF JPG PNG) since [http://tantek.com/2010/165/t2/harvest-remnants-translink-sunglasses-mot-droid at least 2010-06-14], videos (MOV MP4), and video permalinks ([[YouTube]] since [http://tantek.com/2010/195/t3/star-wars-subway-car-improv-everywhere at least 2010-07-14], [[Vimeo]] since [https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/cd65b52be4b72cfcac4618f77344f754d89c9cd3/cassis.js#L977 at least 2011-01-04]) with the CASSIS <code>auto_link</code> function.

=== ... many more ... ===
Feel free to add your site if you also support posting of [[notes]] with autolinking, and note since when.

== Open Source ==
See [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function for a fairly good (and [[selfdogfood]]ed) open source autoembed implementation for [[PHP]]&amp;[[JS]].

== Silo Examples ==
Some [[silos]] autoembed image/video URLs (e.g. [[Facebook]]), some autoembed from links to pages about images/videos, though likely using [[link-preview]] technology ([[Twitter]]).
