{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>access token</dfn>''' is a [[bearer token]] that is given to a [[micropub]] client from a [[token-endpoint]].

== Examples ==
=== ProcessWire IndieAuth Module ===
{{main|ProcessWire IndieAuth}}

The admin area of this module lets you review access tokens you have granted, including the client_id, scopes, last accessed datetime, expiration datetime, issued datetime, and the last several characters of the token. Dates are displayed as month/day/year, but hovering on them shows the full date and time. There is also an option to manually revoke each individual token at any time. The module also has a configuration option (enabled by default) to automatically remove tokens after they expire:
