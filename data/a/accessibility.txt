'''<dfn>Accessibility</dfn>''' is the practice of designing so that people with disabilities can have equal access to information and functionality, applicable to both websites as well as physical environments.

In keeping with the IndieWeb principles that "UX and design is more important than protocols, formats, data models, schema etc.", it's important to make sure that one's site is inclusively "human readable" by as many people as possible.

While designers may create for themselves in pristine and ideal environments, readers using other devices/hardware in harsher environments or who may have various visual, auditory, or other deficits may not be able to access their content easily or at all. 

== Visual ==
Remember to consider people with blindness, low vision, and color-blindness.

=== Color and Contrast ===
{{kevinmarks}} has written an interesting article on [https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6 How the Web Became Unreadable] which discusses some interesting accessibility issues which covers even average users having difficulty seeing material on websites.

The article includes some interesting examples and tools which may help others:

* [http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/ Lea Verou's Contrast Ratio tool]
* [http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ Color Contrast Checker]
* [http://contrastrebellion.com/ Contrast Rebellion] gives some great motivation why contrast is important
* ...

When making the contrast of text and other visual elements lower, designers need to consider the experience of the following:
* elderly users or those with bad vision
* low quality monitors
* bad lighting and glare
* reading on tiny screens
* ...

== Auditory / Hearing ==
Remember those who are hard-of-hearing or deaf.

== Motor Control ==
Remember those with the inability to use a mouse, slow response time, limited fine motor control or even those with "fat fingers" using small mobile interfaces.

== Cognitive defecits ==
Remember those with earning disabilities, distractibility, inability to remember or focus on large amounts of information.

=== Dyslexia ===
Some research indicates that custom fonts can be of help those who suffer from reading issues that include dyslexia.

== Physical Environments ==
{{section-stub}}
Remember those with disabilities when setting up event spaces.
* This is something that came to mind while planning [[IWC Bellingham]] and some of the event space is not wheelchair accessible. I'm researching and considering how to best advertise that clearly to potential attendees. {{gRegor}}

== To Do ==
Several IndieWebCamps and even HWC meetings have included material and discussions on accessibility that could be transplanted onto this page.
