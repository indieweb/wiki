An '''<dfn>acquisition</dfn>''' within the IndieWeb is a type of [[posts|post]] that enumerates purchases, gifts, donations, (stolen?!) and found things potentially with additional information like [[photo|photos]], descriptions, specifications, price paid, date/time acquired, location acquired from, and condition.

== Why ==
* Potentially useful as a form of self-accountability for acquiring material goods. Some people keep running lists or inventories of what they own as a means of limiting possessions. Public posts make ownership more conscious and conspicuous.
* Can be useful for personal budgeting and feedback for review.
* Could be useful for income tax preparation season.
* Useful for looking up details while shopping to remember the type, price, or historical quantity of items one might be purchasing at present. Also for knowing whether you may already have a copy of a particular thing (like a book, DVD, baseball card, other) which is a member of a much larger personal collection thus making it more difficult to recall if you've got a particular item.
* A collection of such posts could potentially be useful when creating a last will and testament, particularly when posts are about durable, long term goods.
* Historical
** In the past diarists often kept notations of purchases and/or entire inventories of the contents of their homes.
* Compare with purging, [[donating]] e.g. http://tantek.com/2015/256/t1/purge-stuff-not-building-positive-future.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} often makes [[read]] posts and wanted a way to better track some of his books, so while purchasing a book on Amazon, he considered making acquisition posts as a means of keeping track of books he purchased--a habit that can run out of control as he's an avid practicer of tsundoku. He also had enabled posting [[wish|wishes]] (a very similar but semantically different type of post) using the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] previously which also creates [http://boffosocko.com/kind/wish/ wishlists on my site] as conglomerated feeds.
* One of his first purchase posts on his own site as a [[note]] [http://boffosocko.com/2015/06/04/why-information-grows-the-evolution-of-order-from-atoms-to-economies/ on 2015-06-04] including syndicated copies.
* An acquisition post of a Christmas tree as a [[photo]] post [http://boffosocko.com/2016/11/27/the-pre-op-patient/ on 2016-11-27]
* Made a [[PESOS]] post on his site from [http://everydaycarry.com/ Every Day Carry] with some acquisition-esque type of data on [http://boffosocko.com/2017/12/30/everyday-carry-december-2017/ 2017-12-30].
* Purging things after reading [http://boffosocko.com/2017/05/09/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-by-marie-kondo/ The Life Changing Magic of Tidying up last year] has also spurned this itch as well.
* He began making explicit acquisition posts using a simple [[note|note-like]] structure on his site on [http://boffosocko.com/2018/02/20/purchased-enlightenment-now-the-case-for-reason-science-humanism-and-progress-by-steven-pinker/ 2018-02-20] using some customized code added to the Post Kinds Plugin. A feed of acquisition posts is available at http://boffosocko.com/kind/acquisition/.
* Prior to this some of his [[checkin]] posts also have non-explicit acquisitions as well, though many of them are as photos which are saved privately on my sites's back end. These typically are posts at stores and shopping centers. Examples include:
** [http://boffosocko.com/2017/09/29/checkin-vons-10/ Groceries at Vons on 2017-09-29]
** [http://boffosocko.com/2018/02/02/checkin-vons-17/ Groceries at Vons 2018-02-02]

=== GoodReads ===
* [[Goodreads]] has a checkmark field for "I own a copy of this book" with additional fields for "condition" "Original purchase location" and "original purchase date"

* Backend UI for imputting ownership data

[[File:Acquisition_indication_on_GoodReads.PNG]]
* UI for ownership page of book, which is only viewable when logged in
[[File:GoodReads_Acquisition_post.PNG]]

=== Amazon ===
* [[Amazon]] provides users with a feed-like list of things you're previously purchased. These pages can typically be found at the URL https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/order-history/ref=nav_youraccount_orders when one is logged in.
* They also display indicators on product pages that you've purchased them before, with links to additional purchase details. These generally look like this:
[[File:Amazon_acquisition.PNG]]
* When finishing the purchasing process Amazon allows users to announce via post to various silos (or email friends) ([[cross-posting|via S2S or POOSNOW]]) that they've made purchases. Examples of UI display follow:
** Screencapture of functionality on Amazon needed here
** Display of acquisition posts from Amazon on Twitter (circa 2012/13):

=== You Need a Budget (aka YNAB) ===
[https://www.youneedabudget.com YouNeedABudget] is a silo site and app that helps users more consciously create a budget and track their income and expenditures for a wide variety of reasons and purposes.

=== Venmo ===
* [[Venmo]] keeps a running list of things you've both acquired as well as items you've been paid for. There are a variety of privacy settings to allow friends or others to see purchases publicly.

=== Everyday Carry ===
* [http://everydaycarry.com/ Every Day Carry] is a social [[silo]] for sharing photos and details of products one carries with them on a daily basis. While not specifically an acquisition type post, it's somewhat related as it gives the impression of a conspicuous consumption site which appears to be primarily focused on knives, phones, watches, tools, pens, and pencils that people would carry in their pockets, briefcases, backpacks, and/or purses.
 
=== Blippy ===
[http://blippy.com Blippy] was a social commerce platform founded in 2009 that allowed users to share credit card purchases with friends. It eventually allowed the ability to make some purchases private so that users could hide sensitive purchases from public view. The service closed down in 2011.
