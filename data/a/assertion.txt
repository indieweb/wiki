An '''<dfn>assertion</dfn>''' is a relationship where one individual/organization makes a statement, asserts, or endorses that anotherâ€™s statement is accurate in their opinion. This can also be the action of issuing a [[badge]].

== Use Cases ==

* References - An individual wants to give a reference to a resume
* [[badges]] - An individual wants to give someone a badge, which represents an achievement they are asserting/attesting to
* Endorsement - An individual wants to endorse an assertion someone else has made in a most.
* Verification - An individual wants a trusted person to post that they are who they say they are or verification that they were at a particular location at a particular time.

== Questions ==

* How do you post that you are soliciting endorsements or others?
* How do you post the criteria for an assertion? Example...a list of criteria for a badge?
* How do you post an assertion that a person and/or their work at a specific URL, met the criteria at another URL? How does that person consume and dipslay that(badges?)

== Brainstorming ==

* An endorsement of what someone posted as a URL or a reference can be an h-review with the URL inside as a p-item. The original criteria can be possibly be noted as u-in-reply-to
* True or false could be indicated either by rating or tagging a pass/fail using p-category to the post.
* Consuming of h-review has been somewhat limited. Uncertain of any examples of posting a review of something that can consume microformats, this might motivate that.
