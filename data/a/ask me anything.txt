'''<dfn>Ask Me Anything</dfn>''' or '''<abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr>''' is a public facing page which allows people to ask questions online they'd like the originator to answer.

A common variation of this is also known as <abbr title="Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything">AMAA</abbr> for "Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything". A common feature of such pages/service providers is often the ability to ask questions anonymously.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Reddit]] - The concept of [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/ AMA] as well as a similar pattern known by [http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/ IAmA] meaning "I am a ____. Ask me Anything" was originated in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Reddit January 2009]. As proof of their [[identity]], all AMA participants (or “OP,” short for “Original Poster”) are required to post an image of themselves. Typically this is done along with a link to their silo profile as well as the date and time of the event. Syndicated copies of their photo proof are often sent to other social networks to spread the word about their appearance. Reddit AMAs are often run for a limited time and are somewhat similar to an online press conference.
