{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Annotations</dfn>''' are [[comments]] (including [[marginalia]]), [[highlight]]s  or any other [[interactions]] that add to (part of) a [[post]], typically added by individuals other than the [[author]].

== Use Cases ==
* See: '''[[annotation-use-cases]]'''

== W3C Recommendations ==
On 2017-02-23 the W3C published [https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6156 several inter-related recommendations] based on the notes of the Web Annotation Working Group. For some discussion on them, see [https://hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/ Annotation is now a web standard] post on Hypothes.is blog.

== Opinions ==
Opinions about "annotation" (the process/action).

=== Just a means to an end ===
* <blockquote>To me, annotation is just a means to an end, so talking about promoting annotation is mistaken. Promote the end *via* annotation. #force2016</blockquote> --[https://twitter.com/mrgunn/status/721843419786510336  William Gunn]

== Silo Examples ==
* [[News Genius]] (AKA Genius, RapGenius)
* [[Amazon]] allows the sharing of notes and highlights from it's Kindle platform online. Example: [https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Chris-Aldrich/80838#recentActivity recent activity]
* [[Hypothes.is]]
* [[Goodreads]]
** On 2016-08-10 Goodreads enabled the ability to sync one's account with their Amazon [[Kindle]] account to port over highlights and annotations from Kindle books to the GoodReads platform and share them with one's followers. (GoodReads is a subsidiary of [[Amazon]]). The blog post [https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/677-share-your-kindle-notes-and-highlights-with-your-friends-beta Share Your Kindle Notes and Highlights with Your Friends (Beta)] describes the details of the functionality whose UI is pictured below.
** Some of the functionality offered includes
*** Highlights and notes are private by default
*** A slider on/off button to make individual annotations visible as well as one to make all annotations visible
*** The ability to delete individual annotations
*** The ability to add notes to each highlight online
*** The ability to mark highlights and notes as [[spoiler|spoilers]].

Readers may comment paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, block-by-block or by selecting text." ([https://github.com/IFBook/commentpress-core Github])

== Criticism ==
=== Annotation Sites Enable Abuse ===
Many web-based annotation programs/applications only allow the communities or subgroups who are aware that they exist to see the annotations, thereby making them available for potential abuse.

[[Webmention]]s could be used to help remedy this potential problem:
* http://boffosocko.com/2016/04/07/webmentions-for-improving-annotation-and-preventing-bullying-on-the-web/

== Brainstorming ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} has been experimenting since [https://boffosocko.com/2018/06/22/highlighted-a-reply-to-laying-the-standards-for-a-blogging-renaissance-by-aaron-davis/ 2018-06-22] with [[PESOS]] of highlights and annotations using [[Hypothes.is]] to his own website for use as part of his [[commonplace book]]. Using [[Post Kinds Plugin]] he has created some custom [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post types]] for being able to post highlights and annotations as specific post types to his website.
** Examples of highlights can be found here: https://boffosocko.com/kind/highlight/
** Examples of annotations can be found here: https://boffosocko.com/kind/annotation/
** After some initial experimentation, he's considering concatenating the two different types (highlights and annotations) into just one catch-all (annotations). He's also been considering using a yellow "highlighter color" in his UI to mirror the physical world incarnation of ubiquitous pen-like ink highlighters as is sometimes done in [[fragmention]] implementations.
**Sometimes he prefers to create [[read]] posts under which he includes the highlights and marginalia from the material he's read. ([https://boffosocko.com/2018/10/22/what-we-learned-from-studying-the-news-consumption-habits-of-college-students-dan-cohen/ example])
**In all cases, he includes URLs when available and sends [[Webmention|webmentions]] to the original pieces so that they might add in line [[marginalia]] as commentary if they prefer.
**Perhaps in the future he'll extrapolate this work using a [[POSSE]] workflow?
**He's used ideas and markup from [[quote]] posts to guide some of his thinking as well.
