{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Annotations</dfn>''' are [[comments]] (including [[marginalia]]), [[highlight]]s  or any other [[interactions]] that add to (part of) a [[post]], typically added by individuals other than the [[author]].

== Why ==
In the broadest sense, "annotations" are any kind of interaction with a piece of content, and as such if that kind of very broad meaning is your interpretation of the term, you can find reasons why to support them in the reasons for:
* [[responses]] in general and in particular:
** [[reply]] and variants
** [[reaction]] and variants

For those that interpret the term "annotation" in a narrower sense of the meaning of inline notes, highlights, or other markings of portions of larger documents, see more specific use-cases such as:
* [[marginalia]]
* [[highlight]]

There may be additional <span id="Use_Cases">use cases</span> and reasons why to use or support annotations documented in:
* [[annotation-use-cases]]

== How to markup ==
For how to markup annotations in general, see the individual how to markup sections for what you are looking to markup:
* [[marginalia#How_To|marginalia how to]]
* [[reply#Post_a_reply|reply/comment how to]]
** [[reacji#How_to_markup|reacji (single emoji reply) how to]]
* [[bookmark#How_to_markup|bookmark how to]]
* [[like#mark_up_and_post_a_like|like how to]]
* [[repost#How_to_Publish|repost how to]]
* [[quotation#How_to_markup|quotation how to]]
See [[responses]] for more types of annotations and details therein.

== Opinions ==
Opinions about "annotation" (the process/action).

=== Just a means to an end ===
<div class="h-cite">
<blockquote class="p-summary">To me, annotation is just a means to an end, so talking about promoting annotation is mistaken. Promote the end *via* annotation. #force2016</blockquote> <cite style="text-align:right; display:block"><span class="p-author h-card">William Gunn</span>, <span class="u-url">https://twitter.com/mrgunn/status/721843419786510336</span></cite>.
</div>

== Silo Examples ==
* [[News Genius]] (AKA Genius, RapGenius)
* [[Amazon]] allows the sharing of notes and highlights from it's Kindle platform online. Example: [https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Chris-Aldrich/80838#recentActivity recent activity]
* [[Hypothes.is]]
* [https://www.scrible.com/ Scrible], allows for annotation as well as [[bookmark]]ing and [[tag]]ging
* [https://fermatslibrary.com Fermat's Library] has a feature called [https://fermatslibrary.com/margins Margins] which allows users to upload .pdf articles to annotate and share with others online. It's primarily geared toward the education space.
* [[Goodreads]]
** On 2016-08-10 Goodreads enabled the ability to sync one's account with their Amazon [[Kindle]] account to port over highlights and annotations from Kindle books to the GoodReads platform and share them with one's followers. (GoodReads is a subsidiary of [[Amazon]]). The blog post [https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/677-share-your-kindle-notes-and-highlights-with-your-friends-beta Share Your Kindle Notes and Highlights with Your Friends (Beta)] describes the details of the functionality whose UI is pictured below.
** Some of the functionality offered includes
*** Highlights and notes are private by default
*** A slider on/off button to make individual annotations visible as well as one to make all annotations visible
*** The ability to delete individual annotations
*** The ability to add notes to each highlight online
*** The ability to mark highlights and notes as [[spoiler|spoilers]].

== W3C Recommendations ==
On 2017-02-23 the W3C published [https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6156 several inter-related recommendations] based on the notes of the Web Annotation Working Group. For some discussion on them, see [https://hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/ Annotation is now a web standard] post on Hypothes.is blog.
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ Web Annotation Data Model]
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/ Web Annotation Protocol]
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/ Web Annotation Vocabulary]

Despite being published as W3C Recommendations, there has been very little actual support in the wild for these W3C specifications, outside of Hypothes.is, which has essentially become a dominant [[silo]] for W3C-spec annotations.

== Criticism ==
=== Annotation Sites Enable Abuse ===
Many web-based annotation programs/applications only allow the communities or subgroups who are aware that they exist to see the annotations, thereby making them available for potential abuse.

[[Webmention]]s could be used to help remedy this potential problem:
* http://boffosocko.com/2016/04/07/webmentions-for-improving-annotation-and-preventing-bullying-on-the-web/

== Brainstorming ==

* {{chrisaldrich}} has been experimenting since [https://boffosocko.com/2018/06/22/highlighted-a-reply-to-laying-the-standards-for-a-blogging-renaissance-by-aaron-davis/ 2018-06-22] with [[PESOS]] of highlights and annotations using [[Hypothes.is]] to his own website for use as part of his [[commonplace book]]. Using [[Post Kinds Plugin]] he has created some custom [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post types]] for being able to post highlights and annotations as specific post types to his website.
** Examples of highlights can be found here: https://boffosocko.com/kind/highlight/. (Note: These were ultimately subsumed into annotations, see just below).
** Examples of annotations can be found here: https://boffosocko.com/kind/annotation/
** After some initial experimentation, he's considering concatenating the two different types (highlights and annotations) into just one catch-all (annotations). He's also been considering using a yellow "highlighter color" in his UI to mirror the physical world incarnation of ubiquitous pen-like ink highlighters as is sometimes done in [[fragmention]] implementations.
**Sometimes he prefers to create [[read]] posts under which he includes the highlights and marginalia from the material he's read. ([https://boffosocko.com/2018/10/22/what-we-learned-from-studying-the-news-consumption-habits-of-college-students-dan-cohen/ example])
**In all cases, he includes URLs when available and sends [[Webmention|webmentions]] to the original pieces so that they might add in line [[marginalia]] as commentary if they prefer.
**Perhaps in the future he'll extrapolate this work using a [[POSSE]] workflow?
**He's used ideas and markup from [[quote]] posts to guide some of his thinking as well.

* {{jeremycherfas}} distinguishes between annotations, which are notes created by a reader for their own use, now and in the future, and other kinds of response, which may be directed more at the author of a piece or other readers of that piece. He is old-fashioned about using annotations to build and make sense of his own knowledge archive. These annotations may eventually find their way into published pieces, but in essence are private responses to the piece in question and its relationship to other pieces.

* {{chaitanya}} started experimenting with annotations using [[Hypothes.is]]. The Hypothes.is user RSS feed is syndicated back to the website using [[IFTTT]] and [[webhooks]].

** "Improvements to citations with footnotes and endnotes.<br>I wrote about adding microformats citations to weblog last November during NaBloPoMo. Then last week, I saw some discussion about footnotes again, replied with a link to my post, and began investigating some of the other solutions I saw mention of. One of them led me down the path of a couple EPUB related role attributes and I decided to go ahead and add them. Let's take a look at what I did through the updates I made to my recent CSS Color Modules and Changes, Part I post.<br>Existing citations<br>Implementation of microformats citations will go unhindered, but here's a light refresher of where I started. The h-cite property resides on a list item and contains one or more of the following properties:<br><br>dt-published<br><br><br>p-author and h-card<br><br><br>p-publication<br><br><br>u-url and p-name<br><br>Here is an example from the referenced CSS Color Modules post above, minus the updates (added below):<br><li class="h-cite"><small><br>  <a id="cite-note--4" href="#cite-ref--4">[4]</a> <br>  <time class="dt-published">2023-02-02</time>, <br>  <span class="p-author h-card">Adam Argyle</span>, <br>  <span class="p-publication">Chrome for Developers</span>, <br>  <cite><a class="u-url p-name" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/migrate-hd-color" rel="external"><i>Migrate to HD CSS color</i></a></cite><br></small></li><br><br>You should also note that the u-url and p-name reside on an <a> inside of a <cite> element. This citation matches the cite attribute on the citation reference on either a <q> or <blockquote>:<br><blockquote cite="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/migrate-hd-color"><br><ol><br>  <li><p><b>Graceful degradation:</b> Use the new color spaces and let the browser and operating system figure out which color to show based on display capabilities.</p></li><br>  <li><p><b>Progressive enhancement:</b> Use <code>@supports</code> and <code>@media</code> to assess the capabilities of the user's browser, and if conditions are met, provide wide gamut colors.<sup id="cite-ref--4"><a href="#cite-note--4">[4]</a></sup></p></li><br></ol><br></blockquote><br><br>Footnotes<br>From what I understand, the EPUB epub:type attribute usage is being replaced with ARIA roles for accessibility: This document provides guidance for publishers looking to move from the use of the EPUB 3 epub:type attribute to ARIA roles for accessibility.[1] <br>That quote is from the abstract of this document, and goes on to explain:<br><br>The biggest of these differences is in their primary applications. The epub:type attribute has evolved to aid publisher workflows. It has limited use enabling reading system behaviors outside of some core functionality of EPUB (identifying navigation elements and enhancing media overlay documents). Although it was hoped the attribute would also expose information to assistive technologies, in practice it does not.The primary purpose of the role attribute, on the other hand, is to expose information to assistive technologies. It is not to facilitate user agent behaviors.[2]<br><br>The two roles I am concerned with for citations are complementary to the two parts of what I've already implemented: the citation reference and the citation note; these are: role="doc-noteref" and role="doc-footnote". The recommendations for each have some stipulations as follows.<br>doc-noteref<br>A reference to a footnote or endnote, typically appearing as a superscripted number or symbol in the main body of text.[3]<br>HTML usage: <a><br><br>doc-footnote<br><br>Ancillary information, such as a citation or commentary, that provides additional context to a referenced passage of text. The doc-footnote role is only for representing individual notes that occur within the body of a work. For collections of notes that occur at the end of a section, see doc-endnotes.[4]<br><br>HTML usage: aside element when identifying a single footnote, or on descendants of sectioning content when identifying individual footnotes in a group (refer to footnotes and endnotes)[5]<br>From this information, I am a bit torn on the requirements, as they seem to slightly contradict each other. You'll see how I've decided to implement this (for now) under Template updates, but I am open to clarity and improvements if this method proves incorrect or incomplete.<br>Endnotes<br>In addition to proper citations relating to references, I also regularly include additional resources and links at the end of most blog posts. This is where I may eventually end up, after adding the requirements for role="doc-footnote" usage, as I believe the better method is to stick with role="doc-endnotes" as the containing section and role="doc-endnote" for each item.<br>doc-endnotes<br>A collection of notes at the end of a work or a section within it.[6]<br>Important context: Note that the doc-endnotes role is never applied directly to the list of endnotes. See the doc-endnote role for more information.[7]<br>This context is important because giving roles to elements can override their inherent nature, such that adding a role to a list element itself will override its role as a list. This will then cause issues with child elements' roles as listitem. Along these same lines, it is no longer necessary to add the role doc-endnote to a list item in a containing doc-endnotes section: [t]hese roles are now implied on list items within sections that have a...doc-endnotes role.[8] However, as I cover in the next section, I have added both roles.<br>doc-endnote<br>One of a collection of notes that occur at the end of a work, or a section within it, that provides additional context to a referenced passage of text.[9]<br>Important context: Authors MUST ensure that elements with role doc-endnote are contained in, or owned, by an element with the role list.[10]<br>If you understand the context in the previous section, the above context should also make sense: doc-endnote must be a child of an element with the role list, either by default through being an HTML list such as <ul> or <ol>, or by having an explicit role of list assigned. My usage of both doc-endnotes on the sectioning element and doc-endnote on the list items may be redundant or unnecessary and I may end up cleaning this up. For now let's see how all this looks together in the template updates I made for weblog.<br>Template updates<br>The updates needed on weblog pretty much exclusively apply to the default post template in config. Since I am using Drafts for weblog authoring, I have both a recipe and post template, the post template mimicking the default post config in weblog, so I'll need to update all three templates.<br>I've added a sectioning element with role="doc-endnotes" and role="doc-endnote" to the list items.

I chose to include it because of the conflicting recommendation to use on descendants of sectioning content when identifying individual footnotes in a group.[11] Additionally, I included role="doc-endnote" even though that role is implicit on a list item within a sectioning element with the role doc-endnotes. These can all be updated and refined when I find clarity on this information.<br>Update: Isn't it just like publishing a post and a few hours later coming across something to change your mind? Well, I've found the thing I needed to make me definitively remove role="doc-endnote from the list items. In the W3C Candidate Recommendation, published February 27, 2024, doc-endnote is listed as deprecated with the following note:<br><br>The doc-endnote role was designed for use as a list item, but due to clarifications in the WAI-ARIA specification, it is not valid as a child of the list role. As the doc-endnotes role already identifies a section of endnotes, authors are instead advised to use the list and listitem roles when native HTML elements cannot be used to structure the entries.[12]<br><br>Secondly, within the same document, the recommendation is now unequivocally to not use doc-footnote within the endnotes as it is redundant. I also appreciate the addition of mentioning that multiple and separate lists of endnotes can be contained within the doc-endnotes sectioning parent.<br><br>The element carrying the doc-endnotes role MUST contain at least one descendant list containing the endnotes (if the notes are subdivided, for example by chapter, the element would contain more than one list).Authors MUST NOT declare elements with the role doc-footnote within the endnotes as it is redundant with the implied role.[13]<br><br>After leaving this post feeling quite unsettled with how I left things, conflicted by what I had found (and documented above), this feels like a 180° turnaround just a few hours later!<br>Post info<br>Citations in this post:<br><br>  [1] <br>  [2] <br>  2023-03-14, <br>  W3C Group Note, <br>  EPUB Type to ARIA Role Authoring Guide<br><br><br>  [3] <br>  2024-02-27, <br>  W3C Candidate Recommendation, <br>  Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-noteref (role)<br><br><br>  [4] <br>  2024-02-27, <br>  W3C Candidate Recommendation, <br>  Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-footnote (role)<br><br><br>  [5] <br>  [11] <br>  2023-12-21, <br>  W3C Group Note, <br>  EPUB 3 Structural Semantics Vocabulary: footnote<br><br><br>  [6] <br>  [7] <br>  2017-12-14, <br>  W3C Recommendation, <br>  Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0: doc-endnotes (role)<br><br><br>  [8] <br>  2023-03-14, <br>  W3C Group Note, <br>  EPUB Type to ARIA Role Authoring Guide 1.1: 3.5 List roles are for lists<br><br><br>  [9] <br>  [10] <br>  2017-12-14, <br>  W3C Recommendation, <br>  Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0: doc-endnote (role)<br><br><br>  [12] <br>  2024-02-27, <br>  W3C Candidate Recommendation, <br>  Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-endnote (role)<br><br><br>  [13] <br>  2024-02-27, <br>  W3C Candidate Recommendation, <br>  Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-endnotes (role)<br><br>Links in this post:<br>Diving into indiewebify.me & microformats, Part VII<br>CSS Color Modules and Changes, Part I<br>EPUB Type to ARIA Role Authoring Guide 1.1<br>Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-noteref (role)<br>Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-footnote (role)<br>Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0: doc-endnotes (role)<br>Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0: doc-endnote (role)<br>Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-endnote (role)<br>Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.1: doc-endnotes (role)<br>POSSE copies:<br>Shared on social.lol<br>Shared on Apple Annie's Microblog<br>Share this post on social media.<br>Discuss on Mastodon" [https://anniegreens.lol/ @Author: Anne Sturdivant] May 12, 2024
