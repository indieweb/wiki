{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Annotations</dfn>''' are [[comments]] (including [[marginalia]]), [[highlight]]s  or any other [[interactions]] that add to (part of) a [[post]], typically added by individuals other than the [[author]].

== How to markup ==
For how to markup annotations in general, see the individual how to markup sections for what you are looking to markup:
* [[marginalia#How_To|marginalia how to]]
* [[reply#Post_a_reply|reply/comment how to]]
** [[reacji#How_to_markup|reacji (single emoji reply) how to]]
* [[bookmark#How_to_markup|bookmark how to]]
* [[like#mark_up_and_post_a_like|like how to]]
* [[repost#How_to_Publish|repost how to]]
* [[quotation#How_to_markup|quotation how to]]
See [[responses]] for more types of annotations and details therein.

== Use Cases ==
* See: '''[[annotation-use-cases]]'''

== Opinions ==
Opinions about "annotation" (the process/action).

=== Just a means to an end ===
* <blockquote>To me, annotation is just a means to an end, so talking about promoting annotation is mistaken. Promote the end *via* annotation. #force2016</blockquote> --[https://twitter.com/mrgunn/status/721843419786510336  William Gunn]

== Silo Examples ==
* [[News Genius]] (AKA Genius, RapGenius)
* [[Amazon]] allows the sharing of notes and highlights from it's Kindle platform online. Example: [https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Chris-Aldrich/80838#recentActivity recent activity]
* [[Hypothes.is]]
* [[Goodreads]]
** On 2016-08-10 Goodreads enabled the ability to sync one's account with their Amazon [[Kindle]] account to port over highlights and annotations from Kindle books to the GoodReads platform and share them with one's followers. (GoodReads is a subsidiary of [[Amazon]]). The blog post [https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/677-share-your-kindle-notes-and-highlights-with-your-friends-beta Share Your Kindle Notes and Highlights with Your Friends (Beta)] describes the details of the functionality whose UI is pictured below.
** Some of the functionality offered includes
*** Highlights and notes are private by default
*** A slider on/off button to make individual annotations visible as well as one to make all annotations visible
*** The ability to delete individual annotations
*** The ability to add notes to each highlight online
*** The ability to mark highlights and notes as [[spoiler|spoilers]].

== W3C Recommendations ==
On 2017-02-23 the W3C published [https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6156 several inter-related recommendations] based on the notes of the Web Annotation Working Group. For some discussion on them, see [https://hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/ Annotation is now a web standard] post on Hypothes.is blog.
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ Web Annotation Data Model]
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/ Web Annotation Protocol]
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/ Web Annotation Vocabulary]

Despite being published as W3C Recommendations, there has been very little actual support in the wild for these W3C specifications, outside of Hypothes.is, which has essentially become a dominant [[silo]] for W3C-spec annotations.

== Criticism ==
=== Annotation Sites Enable Abuse ===
Many web-based annotation programs/applications only allow the communities or subgroups who are aware that they exist to see the annotations, thereby making them available for potential abuse.

[[Webmention]]s could be used to help remedy this potential problem:
* http://boffosocko.com/2016/04/07/webmentions-for-improving-annotation-and-preventing-bullying-on-the-web/

== Brainstorming ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} has been experimenting since [https://boffosocko.com/2018/06/22/highlighted-a-reply-to-laying-the-standards-for-a-blogging-renaissance-by-aaron-davis/ 2018-06-22] with [[PESOS]] of highlights and annotations using [[Hypothes.is]] to his own website for use as part of his [[commonplace book]]. Using [[Post Kinds Plugin]] he has created some custom [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post types]] for being able to post highlights and annotations as specific post types to his website.
** Examples of highlights can be found here: https://boffosocko.com/kind/highlight/
** Examples of annotations can be found here: https://boffosocko.com/kind/annotation/
** After some initial experimentation, he's considering concatenating the two different types (highlights and annotations) into just one catch-all (annotations). He's also been considering using a yellow "highlighter color" in his UI to mirror the physical world incarnation of ubiquitous pen-like ink highlighters as is sometimes done in [[fragmention]] implementations.
**Sometimes he prefers to create [[read]] posts under which he includes the highlights and marginalia from the material he's read. ([https://boffosocko.com/2018/10/22/what-we-learned-from-studying-the-news-consumption-habits-of-college-students-dan-cohen/ example])
**In all cases, he includes URLs when available and sends [[Webmention|webmentions]] to the original pieces so that they might add in line [[marginalia]] as commentary if they prefer.
**Perhaps in the future he'll extrapolate this work using a [[POSSE]] workflow?
**He's used ideas and markup from [[quote]] posts to guide some of his thinking as well.

* {{jeremycherfas}} distinguishes between annotations, which are notes created by a reader for their own use, now and in the future, and other kinds of response, which may be directed more at the author of a piece or other readers of that piece. He is old-fashioned about using annotations to build and make sense of his own knowledge archive. These annotations may eventually find their way into published pieces, but in essence are private responses to the piece in question and its relationship to other pieces.
