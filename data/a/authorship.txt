'''<dfn>authorship</dfn>''' is how to indicate who the [[author]] is for a [[post]], and an algorithm that determines the author of a [[post]].

== Why ==
If you write code which consumes [[h-entry]], e.g. your [[CMS]] receives [[Webmention]]s and you parse the source for post information including who the author is, '''authorship''' is how you determine from that information who the author(s) is/are.

== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Publishing your authorship of a post is designed to be both easy and flexible to adapt to a variety of publishing methods and designs. Any of the following are fine. 

Choose whichever is the least work for you, your site, your theme(s), your code, and easiest for you to maintain!

'''[[posts]]:'''
* [[h-entry]] markup on your posts including an explicit <code>p-author</code> or <code>u-author</code> (preferably enhanced with an embedded [[h-card]], e.g. <code>&lt;a class="u-author h-card" href="/">…&lt;/a></code> if your posts have your name, photo etc. already visible)
* OR if you have an h-card on your website (e.g. from a global template for your header or footer) that links to your homepage, then add a minimal <code>&lt;a class="u-author" href="/">&lt;/a></code> inside your post h-entry.

'''[[streams]] of posts''' (like on an [[archive]], [[homepage]], etc.) without explicit authorship per post:
* [[h-feed]] markup including an explicit <code>p-author</code> or <code>u-author</code> ((preferably enhanced with an embedded [[h-card]] as described above)
* OR if you have an h-card on your website (e.g. from a global template for your header or footer) that links to your homepage, then add a minimal <code>&lt;a class="u-author" href="/">&lt;/a></code> inside your h-feed.

'''separate author description pages''' (e.g. when using <code>u-author</code>)
* [[h-card]] with information about you on your author description page (e.g. [[homepage]])
