'''<dfn>authorship</dfn>''' is how to indicate who the [[author]] is for a [[post]], and an algorithm that determines the author of a [[post]].

== Why ==
You should clearly indicate who is the author of a post so when other sites summarize or reply to your post, they can properly recognize the author(s)!

== How to publish ==
<span id="How_to"></span>

Publishing your authorship of a post is designed to be both easy and flexible to adapt to a variety of publishing methods and designs. Any of the following are fine. 

Choose whichever is the least work for you, your site, your theme(s), your code, and easiest for you to maintain!

=== Authorship for individual posts ===

For individual '''[[posts]]''', (such as a post displayed on its [[permalink]]), you have a few options for how to provide authorship information.

==== Full author information in each post ====
If your posts have your name and photo already visible, then your [[h-entry]] for the post can include a full [[h-card]] with the complete author info for the post, by adding an explicit <code>p-author</code> or <code>u-author</code> property with an embedded [[h-card]], e.g. <code>&lt;a class="u-author h-card" href="/">…&lt;/a></code>

==== Author information in a header or footer ====
If you have an [[h-card]] on your website in a header or footer, you can avoid duplicating the author information inside the [[h-entry]] by establishing a link between the two: add a <code>&lt;a class="u-author" href="/">&lt;/a></code> inside your post h-entry (an invisible link to your home page), and ensure the [[h-card]] in your header or footer has a <code>url</code> property that also links to your home page.

=== Authorship for streams of posts ===

For a page with a '''[[stream]] of posts''' (like on an [[archive]], [[homepage]], etc.), you may want to avoid duplicating authorship information on each individual post:

* [[h-feed]] markup including an explicit <code>p-author</code> or <code>u-author</code> ((preferably enhanced with an embedded [[h-card]] as described above)
* OR if you have an h-card on your website (e.g. from a global template for your header or footer) that links to your homepage, then add a minimal <code>&lt;a class="u-author" href="/">&lt;/a></code> inside your h-feed.

'''separate author description pages''' (e.g. when using <code>u-author</code>)
* [[h-card]] with information about you on your author description page (e.g. [[homepage]])

== Validate ==
