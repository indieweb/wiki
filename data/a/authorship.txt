'''<dfn>authorship</dfn>''' is how to indicate who the [[author]] is for a [[post]], and an algorithm that determines the author of a [[post]].

== Why ==
You should clearly indicate who is the author of a post so when other sites summarize or reply to your post, they can properly recognize the author(s)!

== How to publish ==
<span id="How_to"></span>

Publishing your authorship of a post is designed to be both easy and flexible to adapt to a variety of publishing methods and designs. Any of the following are fine. 

Choose whichever is the least work for you, your site, your theme(s), your code, and easiest for you to maintain!

=== Authorship for individual posts ===

For individual '''[[posts]]''', (such as a post displayed on its [[permalink]]), you have a few options for how to provide authorship information.

==== Full author information in each post ====
If your posts have your name and photo already visible, then your [[h-entry]] for the post can include a full [[h-card]] with the complete author info for the post, by adding an explicit <code>p-author</code> or <code>u-author</code> property with an embedded [[h-card]], e.g. <code>&lt;a class="u-author h-card" href="/">…&lt;/a></code>

Example:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
  <a href="/" class="u-author h-card"><img src="/me.jpg"> Author Name</a>
  <div class="e-content">This is an example note</div>
</div>
</nowiki></pre>

==== Author information in a header or footer ====
If you have an [[h-card]] on your website in a header or footer, you can avoid duplicating the author information inside the [[h-entry]] by establishing a link between the two: add a <code>&lt;a class="u-author" href="/">&lt;/a></code> inside your post h-entry (an invisible link to your home page), and ensure the [[h-card]] in your header or footer has a <code>url</code> property that also links to your home page.

Example:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
  <div class="e-content">This is an example note</div>
  <a href="/" class="u-author"></a>
</div>

...

<footer>
  <a href="/" class="h-card"><img src="/me.jpg"> Author Name</a>
</footer>

</nowiki></pre>

=== Authorship for streams of posts ===

For a page with a '''[[stream]] of posts''' (like on an [[archive]], [[homepage]], etc.), you may want to avoid duplicating authorship information on each individual post.

==== Include authorship with h-feed markup ====
If you have a top-level [[h-feed]], then you can include a <code>u-author</code> property on that feed, either as a full [[h-card]] or referencing an h-card in the header or footer as described above. 

Example:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-feed">
  <a href="/" class="u-author h-card"><img src="/me.jpg"> Author Name</a>

  <div class="h-entry">
    <span class="e-content">This is an example note</span>
  </div>
  <div class="h-entry">
    <span class="e-content">This is an example note</span>
  </div>
</div>
</nowiki></pre>


==== Include authorship without h-feed markup ====
If you don't have an [[h-feed]] and want to display your author info in your website header or footer, you will need to include an invisible <code>u-author</code> property in each [[h-entry]] that shares the same <code>url</code> property as your header or footer h-card.

Example:

<pre><nowiki>
  <div class="h-entry">
    <span class="e-content">This is an example note</span>
    <a href="/" class="u-author"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="h-entry">
    <span class="e-content">This is an example note</span>
    <a href="/" class="u-author"></a>
  </div>
  ...
  <footer>
    <a href="/" class="h-card"><img src="/me.jpg"> Author Name</a>
  </footer>
</nowiki></pre>


=== Dedicated author page ===
If you don't want to show any author information on your post permalinks or feed pages, you can create an [[h-card]] on your [[home page]] and link to it from an invisible <code>u-author</code> property in each post or feed.

Example permalink:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
  <div class="e-content">This is an example note</div>
  <a href="/" class="u-author"></a>
</div>
</nowiki></pre>

Home page:

<pre><nowiki>
...
<div class="h-card">
  <img src="/me.jpg" class="u-photo">
  <a href="/" class="u-url p-name">Author Name</a>
</div>
...
</nowiki></pre>
