{{stub}}
An '''<dfn>auto-url-summary</dfn>''' is brief human readable text generated automatically from the parts of a URL, often using special knowledge about the URL structures at particular domains, as a way to provide a summary of what the URL is about, instead of (or before) accessing the URL itself and reading the [[microformats]] there for more information.

== Why ==
In general auto-url-summary is useful when for some reason it is not possible (or not desirable) to retrieve the URL and parse it for microformats to generate an actual summary.  Some reasons:
* simpler to code
* [[offline]] support
* user preference to minimize indirect loading, e.g. [[performance]] considerations for a low bandwidth connection, or perhaps [[privacy]]
* text placeholder while lazy loading the URL
* no easily discernible information at the URL itself, e.g. it returns apparent gibberish, a binary format, random JSON/XML/etc.

Specific use-cases where this is useful:

=== Minimal reply context ===
An auto-url-summary can be used to generate a [[reply-context#Minimal_text_reply_contexts|minimal text reply context]].

=== Link preview ===
Similarly, an auto-url-summary may be used to provide a text-only link preview.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has been generating and displaying auto-url-summaries in in-stream [[reply-context#Minimal_text_reply_contexts|minimal text reply contexts]] since [http://tantek.com/2018/050/t1/authorize-bridgy-prompt 2018-02-19] using an experimental [[CASSIS]] function: [https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis-lab.php#L52 auto_url_summary] (selfdogfooding on his own site)

=== ... more ... ===
Feel free to add your site if you also use auto-url-summary anywhere in your personal site / posting UI, and note since when.

== Open Source ==
See the [[CASSIS]] experimental <code>[https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis-lab.php#L52 auto_url_summary]</code> function for a start at a decent (and [[selfdogfood]]ed) open source auto_url_summary implementation for [[PHP]]&amp;[[JS]].

== Brainstorming ==
=== English design ===
Copied from [[reply-context#Minimal_text_reply_contexts|minimal text reply contexts]]:

* if URL is a tweet permalink of user aaronpk, <blockquote style="color:gray">@aaronpkâ€™s tweet</blockquote>
* else if URL is a Github issue comment permalink (github.com/owner/xyz/issues/n#issuecomment-m), <blockquote style="color:gray">a comment on issue #n of GitHub project xyz</blockquote>
* else if URL is a Github issue (github.com/owner/xyz/issues/n), <blockquote style="color:gray">issue n of GitHub project xyz</blockquote>
* else if URL is a Github repo or issues list (github.com/owner/xyz or github.com/owner/xyz/issues optional trailing /), <blockquote style="color:gray">GitHub project xyz</blockquote>
* else <blockquote style="color:gray">URL</blockquote>

Feel free to expand with suggestions for other domains / URL patterns.
