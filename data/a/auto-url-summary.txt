{{stub}}

<span class="p-summary">An '''<dfn>auto-url-summary</dfn>''' is brief, human-readable text generated automatically from the parts of a URL, often using special knowledge about the URL structures at particular domains, as a way to provide a summary of what the URL is about, instead of (or before) accessing the URL itself and reading the [[microformats]] there for more information.</span>

== Why ==
In general auto-url-summary is useful when for some reason it is not possible (or not desirable) to retrieve the URL and parse it for microformats to generate an actual summary.  Some reasons:
* simpler to code
* [[offline]] support
* user preference to minimize indirect loading, e.g. [[performance]] considerations for a low bandwidth connection, or perhaps [[privacy]]
* text placeholder while lazy loading the URL
* no easily discernible information at the URL itself, e.g. it returns apparent gibberish, a binary format, random JSON/XML/etc.

Specific use-cases where this is useful:

=== Minimal reply context ===
An auto-url-summary can be used to generate a [[reply-context#Minimal_text_reply_contexts|minimal text reply context]].

=== Link preview ===
Similarly, an auto-url-summary may be used to provide a text-only link preview.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has been generating and displaying auto-url-summaries in in-stream [[reply-context#Minimal_text_reply_contexts|minimal text reply contexts]] since [http://tantek.com/2018/050/t1/authorize-bridgy-prompt 2018-02-19] using an experimental [[CASSIS]] function: [https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis-lab.php#L52 auto_url_summary] (selfdogfooding on his own site)

=== ... more ... ===
Feel free to add your site if you also use auto-url-summary anywhere in your personal site / posting UI, and note since when.

== Open Source ==
=== PHP ===
See the [[CASSIS]] experimental <code>[https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis-lab.php#L52 auto_url_summary]</code> function for a start at a decent (and [[selfdogfood]]ed) open source auto_url_summary implementation for [[PHP]]&amp;[[JS]].

=== Python ===
[[IndieWeb_Utils|IndieWeb Utils]] has implemented a variant of the CASSIS <code>auto_url_summary</code> in Python. View the [https://indieweb-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context.html#generate-a-url-summary IndieWeb Utils documentation for this function].

== Brainstorming ==
=== English design ===
Copied from [[reply-context#Minimal_text_reply_contexts|minimal text reply contexts]]:

* if URL is a tweet permalink of user aaronpk, <blockquote style="color:gray">@aaronpk’s tweet</blockquote>
* else if URL is a Github issue comment permalink (github.com/owner/xyz/issues/n#issuecomment-m), <blockquote style="color:gray">a comment on issue #n of GitHub project xyz</blockquote>
* else if URL is a Github issue (github.com/owner/xyz/issues/n), <blockquote style="color:gray">issue n of GitHub project xyz</blockquote>
* else if URL is a Github repo or issues list (github.com/owner/xyz or github.com/owner/xyz/issues optional trailing /), <blockquote style="color:gray">GitHub project xyz</blockquote>
* else <blockquote style="color:gray">URL</blockquote>

Feel free to expand with suggestions for other domains / URL patterns.

=== CASSIS auto_url_summary improvements ===
Some ideas I had for improving the CASSIS auto_url_summary function. - {{t}}

* Bool param: solo recognized only, default false

* recognize [[nicknames-cache]] primary domain, get text name (rather than account path / alias), and use that for <blockquote style="color:gray">name’s post</blockquote> (or tweet for @-names etc.)

These brainstorms may be more relevant on [[reply-context]], but keeping here for now in context of other auto-url-summary related improvements.
* use as a fallback for [[h-cite]] parsing (especially of an [[in-reply-to]] h-cite on a post), if the h-cite lacks an explicit <code>p-summary</code> and <code>p-name</code>. E.g.
** Parse & load in-reply-to h-cite
** explicit summary if any
** explicit name if any
** If neither then imply name
** Display:
*** name -> "post"
*** else summary -> "note"

Next:
* Display: first check if h-cite has in-reply-to -> "reply"

Next:
* Attempt loading of in-reply-to URL
** Retrieve reply-context h-cite at publish preview time
** Cache reply-context h-cite at post time
** Load additional h-cite fields
*** Author: name, photo, url
