{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>allowlist</dfn>''' (or <dfn>allow list</dfn>) is a list of individuals or domains who are expressly permitted by the site using it. The opposite is a [[blocklist]], where anyone on the list is specifically not permitted.

Other terms for this may be safe list, permit list, accept list, etc. The legacy term "whitelist" is discouraged.

== Why ==
The primary <span id="Use-cases">use-case</span> for allowlists is for automatically handling comment moderation, or rather, displaying [[comments]] (and possibly other [[responses]]) automatically without moderation.
=== Autodisplay comments ===
In the context of [[moderation]], this would be individuals who would be allowed to have their comments displayed bypassing other moderation types. 

This is useful in avoiding the burden of having to moderate for known/trusted individuals and to only have additional levels of scrutiny for newer individuals.

WordPress, for example, has a feature where it will automatically approve any comment by an individual with a previously approved comment. This is the simplest way to generate such a list...people you trusted to comment in the past may comment in the future.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} added a textarea to the WordPress webmention plugin that contains a list of domains allowed to bypass moderation. For moderated webmentions, there is an option to allow, or allow all webmentions from that domain.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}}: my [[ProcessWire#ProcessWire_Webmention|ProcessWire Webmention]] plugin has an allowlist of domains it will accept [[vouch]]es from. The plugin supports monitoring a blogroll and adding new links it finds as well as manually updating the list of allowed domains.

This is working on gregorlove.com since 2016-04-10. The list is only used if the option "Require webmention with Vouch" is enabled. Since Vouch is not widely implemented, I do not have this option on currently.

== Sessions ==
As noted in a discussion on [https://indieweb.org/2018/Berlin/responses Responses] at IWC Berlin 2018, a list like this may not mean display or not display...it may mean a reduction in the amount of detail displayed.
