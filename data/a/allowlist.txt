An '''<dfn>Allowlist</dfn>''' is a <dfn>list of individuals or domains who are expressly permitted by the site using it</dfn>. The opposite of this would be a deny list, where anyone on the list is specifically not permitted.

Other terms for this may be whitelist, permit list, accept list, etc.

In the context of moderation, this would be individuals who would be allowed to have their comments displayed bypassing other moderation types. 

This is useful in avoiding the burden of having to moderate for known/trusted individuals and to only have additional levels of scrutiny for newer individuals.

WordPress, for example, has a feature where it will automatically approve any comment by an individual with a previously approved comment. This is the simplest way to generate such a list...people you trusted to comment in the past may comment in the future.

As noted in a discussion on [https://indieweb.org/2018/Berlin/responses Responses] at IWC Berlin 2018, a list like this may not mean display or not display...it may mean a reduction in the amount of detail displayed.
