'''<dfn>[https://getpebble.com/pebble Pebble]</dfn>''' or the <dfn>Pebble Watch</dfn> is a [[smart watch]] that pairs to a [[mobile]] device via [[Bluetooth LE]], and provides a very minimal low resolution black&white text & pixel display, has passive sensors (3D accelerometer, compass, ambient light), a vibration motor and four buttons.

The manufacturer currently supports interfacing with the [[iOS]] and [[Android]] operating systems. 

== App Store == 

Pebble announced on 2014-01-06 that they would be launching an app store. Pebble, from the beginning, has supported apps written in C with the use of their SDK. Many of these apps required the use of companion apps on the connected phone. 

Since version 2.0 of the API, a javascript library permits Watchapps to access phone functions and the Internet directly. 

== Criticisms ==

* Pebble is limited to the installation of 8 watchfaces/watchapps.
