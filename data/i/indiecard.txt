'''<dfn>indiecard</dfn>''' is a brainstorming proposal for an open [[link-preview]] and [[cards]] standard based on using [[microformat]] root h-* class names on the body element, and re-using microformats properties such as p-name, p-summary, u-photo, u-featured to provide functionality equivalent to Facebook's [[OGP]], [[Twitter Cards]], and other proprietary/corp-driven efforts.

== Brainstorming ==
Ideas towards indie cards. Once tested/deployed, we should graduate these up to actual Why / How to sections.

=== How to markup ===
Make sure the first h-* item on your page represents the page.

Use &lt;body class="h-*"&gt; for the first h-* item on the page.

Use an explicit p-name if the implied one is not ideal/too long.

Use p-summary for more detail.

Use u-photo for an image.

=== How to be backward compatible ===
How to be backward compatible with other card/review consuming systems.

* Use a good title element
* ? Use meta description for the description / summary. (? for [[Facebook]], [[Google Search]])
* Use an image early on in the page that is at least 200(?) pixels wide

=== How to parse an indiecard ===
In summary: Use first h-* item found on a page

Look at the first h-* item on the URL given, if it has a u-url defined that is *not* the current page, follow that link as it is more likely to have more data.

Use p-name, u-url, u-photo and p-summary, if present. [http://www.unmung.com/ unmung] has an experimental parser.
