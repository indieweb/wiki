An '''<dfn>influencer</dfn>''' is a person with a large number of [[followers]], typically on social media [[silo]] profiles, often with their own independent blog, who also receives a lot of [[responses]] on their posts, that brands sometimes seek out, and other times themselves seek out brands, to do deals for goods and/or services in exchange for posts. 

== Why ==
Being or becoming an influencer may be another motivation to [[POSSE]] your posts, to expand your [[reach]], and show greater engagement by [[backfeed]]ing responses to your own website.

It earned 21 million views, and sparked such a strong backlash against Kis Cafe that the bar closed permanently on Monday, July 28.</blockquote>
