=== album posts ===
I often post many related photos with the same general location and tags so would be nice to be able to group these and share them as an album

=== person tags ===
I want to be able to tag people in photos. 

=== feeds ===
* latest x posts
* date YYMM
* tags
* location

=== aggregates ===
* maps
* sparklines

=== micropub client ===
* I want something that suggests edits to make or highlights posts that don't have much metadata ie location, tags.
* Could detect tags that are spelled differently?
* Suggest 'mates' and person tag when faces are detected in photos
* suggest location when lat/lng detected in photos


=== address book ===
Would be great to have all my contacts available on my site.
* This would be the source for auto complete for person tags.
* Might need to hide certain information like phone numbers/addresses when not logged in?

=== calendar ===
Calendar of events
* Synced from phone?
