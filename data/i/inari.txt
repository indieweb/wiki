== Features ==

=== Micropub endpoint ===

A micropub endpoint that:
* verifies access token in header
* accepts form-encoded posts

=== micropub client ===

* create photo posts

== Itches ==

=== json encoded micropub ===
This allows for using more posting clients and also enables the creation of more complex post types like albums

=== album posts ===
I often post many related photos with the same general location and tags so would be nice to be able to group these and share them as an album

=== person tags ===
I want to be able to tag people in photos. 

=== feeds ===
* latest x posts
* date YYMM
* tags
* location

=== aggregates ===
* maps
* sparklines

=== micropub client ===
* I want something that suggests edits to make or highlights posts that don't have much metadata ie location, tags.
* Could detect tags that are spelled differently?
* Suggest 'mates' and person tag when faces are detected in photos
* suggest location when lat/lng detected in photos
