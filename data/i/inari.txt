Inari is a personal publishing application

== Features ==

=== Micropub endpoint ===

A micropub endpoint that:
* verifies access token in header
* accepts form-encoded posts

=== micropub client ===

* create photo posts

== Itches ==

=== json encoded micropub ===
This allows for using more posting clients and also enables the creation of more complex post types like albums

=== album posts ===
I often post many related photos with the same general location and tags so would be nice to be able to group these and share them as an album

=== person tags ===

=== feeds ===
(latest, date, tags, location)

=== aggregates ===
(maps, sparklines etc)
