{{stub}}

'''<dfn>import</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb refers to the ability to take an [[export]] and add it to your site.

== Brainstorming ==
If your site can already create posts using [[Micropub]], then a similar code path can be used to import a backup of a site that was exported as an [[h-feed]]. The same code that knows how to internally store posts created by Micropub could be used to interpret and store each entry in an h-feed.

=== re-sending webmentions for imported posts ===
When would you want to (re)send webmentions for imported posts? 
* if the URL scheme changed from your old site to your new site (e.g. you moved from flat URLs like /one /two to wordpress with URLs like /2017/01/post-one /2017/02/post-two)
* if you are importing from a different domain to a new domain
* if something about the posts themselves changed because of the import, such as new author name or photo
