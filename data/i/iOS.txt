'''<dfn>iOS</dfn>''' is the operating system that runs on the [[Apple]] [[iPhone]] and previously on the [[iPod]] Touch.

'''<dfn>iPadOS</dfn>''' is the name for the version of iOS tailored for the [[iPad]]. While there are some differences, iPadOS remains very much tied to iOS and the name differentiation isn't super important. Apple also has '''<dfn>WatchOS</dfn>''' and '''<dfn>tvOS</dfn>''' which are similar. It's all based on macOS anyway.

== How to ==
=== How to export photos ===
If you use [[macOS]], use the built-in '''Image Capture''' application to download your photos to the file system in your computer, and then back them up or move them anywhere you would your other files.

On [[Linux#Ubuntu|Ubuntu Linux]], you can export photos using the "idevicepair" utility.

To do so:

* Run sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils ifuse.
* Run idevicepair validate.
* Run mkdir pics && ifuse pics.
* Go into the pics folder that you just created.
* Go into pics/DCIM/.
* Copy all folders from pics/DCIM to a folder on your local computer (pics is synced to your phone so you need to copy the photos over to your computer if you want to save them locally).
* Your photos will be on your home computer.
* Eject the pics mounted folder from the file editor.

These steps are derived from the following Stack Overflow answer:

== Development ==
* [[IndieWebKit]] is a [https://swift.org Swift] library for using IndieWeb tools.

== Issues ==
=== Apple ID sign-in dialog too phishable ===
Apparently it is far too easy for nefarious iOS [[app]] developers to produce sign-in dialogs that look like an [[Apple ID]] sign-in dialog, and thus potentially trick ([[phish]]) the user into giving up their credentials.
