== Exporting photos ==

Exporting photos on iOS is not an easy problem to solve if you do not use macOS which provides built-in utilities such as photo syncing between your iPhone and Mac.

On Ubuntu and Linux, you can export photos easily using the "idevicepair" utility.

To do so:

* Run sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils ifuse.
* Run idevicepair validate.
* Run mkdir pics && ifuse pics.
* Go into the pics folder that you just created.
* Go into pics/DCIM/.
* Copy all folders from pics/DCIM to a folder on your local computer (pics is synced to your phone so you need to copy the photos over to your computer if you want to save them locally).
* Your photos will be on your home computer.
* Eject the pics mounted folder from the file editor.

These steps are derived from the following Stack Overflow answer:

== Issues ==
=== Apple ID sign-in dialog too phishable ===
Apparently it is far too easy for nefarious iOS [[app]] developers to produce sign-in dialogs that look like an [[Apple ID]] sign-in dialog, and thus potentially trick ([[phish]]) the user into giving up their credentials.
