An <dfn>image proxy</dfn> is a service that fetches and re-serves images from a new URL, used by IndieWeb sites to provide better performance, fidelity, and/or reliability of images embedded in posts.

== Why ==
Image proxies can help website performance, customize images for their page context, and improve image viewing reliability with the following techniques:
* resizing, reformatting, cropping, filtering or otherwise modifying images before serving inside a page
* avoiding mixed content warnings when serving images from other sites
* caching content that may disappear in the future

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{barryf}} has [https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/i-ve-just-set-up-ssl implemented camo] on his website to proxy external images to https
* {{willnorris}} wrote and runs a [https://willnorris.com/2014/01/a-self-hosted-alternative-to-jetpacks-photon-service go image proxy], primarily for dynamic resizing.
* {{kylewm}}'s [[Red Wind]] has an in-built imageproxy that proxies and resizes images. Requests include a signature to prevent external use.
* {{martymcguire}} uses [https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy willnorris' imageproxy] for media on his personal notes site, [[Cloudinary]] for media and as a thumbnail cache for author images on his personal site.
* {{snarfed}} uses [https://www.cloudimage.io/ cloudimage.io] on [https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/ facebook-atom] and [https://instagram-atom.appspot.com/ instagram-atom].
