'''<dfn>[http://ikiwiki.info/ ikiwiki]</dfn>''' is an open source software [[project]] for hosting a wiki on your own site that uses [[Git]] for storage and [http://xapian.org/ Xapian] for search. Ikiwiki is written in [[Perl]].

Ikiwiki is a wiki compiler; it generates static web pages from a directory tree of plain text files, by default written in [[Markdown]].  In this respect it is similar to [[Jekyll]], however Ikiwiki provides a [[CGI]]-script, which allows authentication with [[OpenID]] (and others), online editing of pages, viewing the (Markdown) source of pages, etc. thus enabling online collaboration.

Ikiwiki can generate a website from plain files, however it integrates tightly with version control systems.  [[Git]] is widely used, however [[svn|Subversion]], [[bzw|Bazaar]] and
others are supported.

Ikiwiki has good support for blogs and other aggregations, like todo lists, bug tracking, forums.  On the other side it is sometimes [http://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/sj/blog/20140720-ikiwiki-navbar.html criticized] for its default web design
