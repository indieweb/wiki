A [[blog_carnival|carneval]] on the topics connected to the IndieWeb specifically. 

Started as based on the discussion in the [[events/2023-06-14-hwc-europe|Homebrew club London/Europe]]. One of the roles would be to motivate people to post more on their websites.

Each month, the carnival has a different host. On the beginning of the month the host come up with the topic, and post it both on their website and here. Then other people post their submissions and alert the host about them. On the end of the month, the host collects all the recived submissions and posts an overview of it. 

Currently having the first iteration, so gauge the interest of the other members of the IndieWeb community. It is run by {{sarajaksa}} on the topic of IndieWeb and cooking.

If you want to volunteer as the future host, please add your name to the below list of future hosts.
