'''<dfn>IndieWeb carnival</dfn>''' is a [[blog carnival]] on topics related to the IndieWeb specifically. 

== Why ==
An IndieWeb carnival will help motivate people to post more on their personal websites. See also:
* [[why post]]

== How to ==
Each month, the carnival has a different host. On the beginning of the month the host come up with the topic, and post it both on their website and here. Then other people post their submissions and alert the host about them. On the end of the month, the host collects all the received submissions and posts an overview of it. 

== Hosting ==

The whole process is open to change, so any suggestions welcome.

If you want to volunteer as the future host, please add your name to the below list of future hosts.

== Current rules (can be changed in the future) ==

=== Rules for the host ===

The carnival happens every month that has the host. In the beginning of the month the host posts about their topic on the blog. The host then collects the submissions until the end of the month. After that, the host posts the summary of all the submissions with the links and send them to the next month's host post.

The minimal what every host would be accepting is the blog posts in English. The host can specify a broader range of submissions, that they are willing to accept (like different media, formats or langauges).

The main way of people submitting the post are webmentions. If your site does not support the webmentions, then the main way of submitting is the email. As a host can also specify a different way to accept the submissions.

=== Rules for the participants ===

Assuming that any rules the host has specified for their carnival take precedence. Otherwise the rules defined below stand.

Once you see the topic, post something connected to the topic suggested on your blog. The blog should be written in the month the carnival is taking place - so between the posting of the topic and the last day of the month. Then submit your submission to the host of this month. 

Since this is an IndieWeb community, the main way of people submitting the post are webmentions. If the host site does not support the webmentions, then send them an email with the link. 

The minimal what every host would be accepting is the blog posts in English.
