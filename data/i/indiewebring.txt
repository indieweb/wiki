'''<dfn>Indiewebring</dfn>''' is part of the great rebirth of of [[webrings]] powered by #IndieWeb technology that made 2018 the year of the webring and not the year of the [[microsub]] [[reader]]. Webrings allow ringmasters (or alternately ringbearers) to create a network of blogs around a shared goal where readers can choose the next, previous, and random blog in the ring.

At [[2018|IndieWeb Summit 2018]], {{schmarty}} built the IndieWebRing which is available on [[Glitch]] at https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/ or https://🕸💍.ws. The code can be found at https://glitch.com/~steady-sundial.

For those using [[WordPress]] or other sites that filter out or don't react well to native emoji, one can use the respective Hexadecimal HTML Entities to get the webring to appear on their websites:

<code><nowiki><p><a href="https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/&&#8203;#xe14a;/previous">←</a> <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="&&#8203;#x1f578;" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/svg/1f578.svg"><img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="&&#8203;#xe034;" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/svg/1f48d.svg"><a href="https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/&&#8203;#xe14a;/next">→</a></p></nowiki></code>

For those using Micro.blog, see <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2018/web-rings/">this help page</a> for how to authorize IndieWeb Ring and add the HTML to your hosted microblog footer.
