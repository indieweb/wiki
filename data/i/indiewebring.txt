'''<dfn>[https://🕸💍.ws/ Indiewebring]</dfn>''' is a [[webring]] across IndieWeb sites and blogs, part of the great rebirth of of [[webrings]] powered by #IndieWeb technology that made 2018 the year of the webring. Webrings allow ringbearers to create a network of blogs around a shared goal where readers can choose the next, previous, and random blog in the ring.

The IndieWebRing (IndieWeb Webring) is built and maintained by {{martymcguire}} and is available at https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/ or https://🕸💍.ws. The code can be found at https://git.schmarty.net/schmarty/gem-diamond/.

The first version of the IndieWeb Webring was also built by {{martymcguire}} at the [[2018|IndieWeb Summit 2018]] on [[Glitch]]. The code for that version is no longer maintained, but can be found at https://glitch.com/~steady-sundial.

A directory of members of the webring can be found at https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/directory. It only includes those who have directly consented to being added to the directory and who have set up [[representative h-card]]s.
