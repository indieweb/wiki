'''<dfn>Indiewebring</dfn>''' is part of the great rebirth of of [[webrings]] powered by #IndieWeb technology that made 2018 the year of the webring and not the year of the [[microsub]] [[reader]]. Webrings allow ringbearers to create a network of blogs around a shared goal where readers can choose the next, previous, and random blog in the ring.

At [[2018|IndieWeb Summit 2018]], {{schmarty}} built the IndieWebRing which is available on [[Glitch]] at https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/ or https://🕸💍.ws. The code can be found at https://glitch.com/~steady-sundial.
