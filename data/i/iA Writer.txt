== Features ==
=== Micropub support ===
On [https://ia.net/writer/blog/new-pdf-preview-better-web-publishing-improved-editing 2020-05-13 it announced] support for [[Micropub]] publishing to a variety of websites including [[micro.blog]] and [[WordPress]].

==== History ====
* Prior request for Micropub support:
** {{eddiehinkle.com}} submitted a short request on April 9, 2019 using their feedback system outlining the fact that it is an open w3c standard with links to the w3c recommendation page, the IndieWeb micropub page and. the test suite [https://micropub.rocks micropub.rocks]. He also listed the servers they would be able to post to (Known, Wordpress, Drupal) with a link to the Micropub Servers page and specially called out [https://micro.blog micro.blog] support.
** {{sebsel}} submitted a short request too, on March 3rd, 2017, on [https://seblog.nl/2017/03/03/1/day-39-inquiring-about-micropub Day 39] of his [[100 days of IndieWeb]]. They responded with some enthusiasm, stating they did not have any plans of expanding their blogging exports, because there were too many platforms to support, but that Micropub would "put a stop to any slippery-slope issues".

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===

{{sebsel}} has been using iA Writer for years to write stories and articles. The plain-text file format lead him to discover [[Kirby]] which lead to the discovery of the IndieWeb for him. He did not have a direct publishing flow before the Micropub integration, but most longer posts were drafted in iA Writer and pasted into [[Quill]] to publish.
