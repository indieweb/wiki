<dfn>'''https://indiecert.net IndieCert'''</dfn> was a service to authenticate to services around the web without using usernames and passwords. The domain lapsed and is now an unrelated page.

IndieCert uses SSL client certificates installed in the user's browser. Client certificates provide superior security. Until now it has been cumbersome to deploy client certificates outside managed corporate environments. This service improves on this by making it easier to deploy client certificates and support multiple (mobile) devices.

Current limitations:

* <strike>Only supports client certificates that were generated by indiecert.net</strike>
* <strike>Does not speak [[indieauth]] protocol and thus cannot be used as [[distributed-indieauth]] endpoint</strike>
