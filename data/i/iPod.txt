The Apple '''<dfn>iPod</dfn>''' is a portable music player that comes in many forms, including the iPod Touch which runs [[iOS]], iOS applications, and can be used as a [[mobile]] communicator and web browsing device.

== Why ==
The iPod touch is smaller and lighter than any iPhone, can be used to [[message]] & [[call]] anyone, and with a good [[contact]] page, can be used to easily receive messages & calls.

The battery life typically lasts longer than an iPhone.

== How to ==
How to best use an iPod Touch, specifically to avoid or minimize "data capture" that is subsequently difficult (if not impossible) to export.
=== General Use Strategies ===
* '''Use offline plus sync apps'''. Use applications that ''both'':
** allow you to create and edit content even when offline
** automatically background sync that content to a server / online service
* Avoid using applications that lack automatic background sync.
* Run similar apps on MacOS and auto-download the data, e.g.:
** '''Messages''': use https://github.com/aaronpk/iMessage-Export on MacOS
* ...

=== For Different Content ===
* '''Notes'''
** Use '''[[Gmail]]''' drafts for note taking / text files
*** drafts then available on apps across platform, and via Gmail's web UI.
** instead of the built-in [[iOS]] '''Notes''' application - which only syncs via Apple proprietary [[iCloud]], which can only be accessed by Apple proprietary apps (no web access to iCloud content).
* '''Photos''' & '''Videos'''
** Use the built-in [[OSX]] '''Image Capture''' application to import photos and videos, and delete them from the iPod. (Deleting helps avoid having the device fill-up and crash various functionality, apps, features like wifi, or the whole system).
* '''Messages'''
** Use '''[[Facebook]]''' Messenger 
*** available on apps across platform, and via Facebook's web UI.
** instead of [[iMessage]], which can only be accessed by Apple proprietary apps
** alternatively use [[Google Hangouts]], which has similar advantages as Facebook Messenger, except is VERY slow to launch / open / view conversations, and also VERY slow to confirm sending of messages to the server, and is much less reliable about background notifications to message recipients 
* '''Starbucks Gift Card'''
** Take a screenshot of the app when you bring up the "Pay" screen with the QRCode-like bar, then use archive/copy that screenshot per the "Photos" instructions above.

=== Export Your Data ===
How to export your data from an iPod, especially if its wifi is broken.

* '''Photos''' - use Image Capture to download all the photos (and optionally delete them to free up space on the iOS device)

... this really needs much more documentation - see real world example of this problem in [[#Broken_Wifi]] below ...

== iPod Touch Issues ==
=== Broken Wifi ===
It is possible for an iPod 5 Touch running in iOS9.2(.1) to somehow get into a state where its Wifi is neither on nor off, and you cannot change it either.[http://tantek.com/2016/020/t3/ipod-touch-ios9-wifi-stopped-working]

This is indicated with a dark grey circle on the swipe-up preferences where the Wifi status/button would normally be, and in a greyed out toggle switch in Settings:
