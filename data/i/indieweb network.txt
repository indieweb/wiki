'''<dfn>indieweb network</dfn>''' is an overview of [[friendly|IndieWeb friendly]] applications, silos, [[CMS|CMSes]], and platforms and which [[specifications]] they support.

For a list of projects supporting individual [[specifications]], see the wiki-page for the specific specification. The [[plurality]] principle of the IndieWeb means that there are many [[projects]] of  many shapes, often favoring composition over a single application that solves it all, making it hard to fit them into this list.
