'''<dfn>[https://ind.ie Ind.ie]</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Small Technology Foundation</dfn>) is currently (2020) a corporation of two designers who build things, some of which overlap & align with IndieWeb [[principles]].

== History ==
Ind.ie was founded by Aral Balkan. Ind.ie was funded by a mix of personal investment by Aral Balkan and his family and crowdfunding donations from December 2014.

== Past Products ==
=== IndiePhone ===
On 2013-11-28, Aral announced the IndiePhone at the Handheld 2013 conference.[http://vimeo.com/81015888]

On 2014-11-08, Ind.ie announced four products in development on the path to building the Indie Phone:[https://ind.ie/blog/the-long-road-to-freedom/]

* '''Heartbeat''' – "a social network system to allow people to communicate between each other without a central server using Pulse as the back-end."
* '''[https://source.ind.ie/project/waystone Waystone]''' – a discovery service to find other people using Heartbeat.
* '''phone''' – a smartphone device with a new operating system built from scratch according to indie tech principles.

On 2014-12-14, a crowdfunding campaign by Ind.ie for the IndiePhone concluded after raising more than $100,000 ([https://ind.ie/blog/thank-you/ Ind.ie blog post]).

On 2015-01-12, a blog post on the Ind.ie website entitled [https://ind.ie/blog/focus/ Focus] announced that the company would be switching towards building only Heartbeat.

Following this announcement, a fair number of Twitter users were critical of the decision and a number of people who donated to the crowdfunding campaign asked for refunds, which Ind.ie said they would provide. ([https://twitter.com/indie/status/554963385587367936 tweet from @ind.ie])

'''Update: 2015-09-07''' Regarding the above paragraph, we didn’t just claim it, we ''provided'' the refunds that were asked for :) —[[User:aralbalkan.com|Aral]]

=== Heartbeat ===
Ind.ie's <span id="Heartbeat_project">Heartbeat project</span> was a product to "Share the things that matter to you with the people you care about (and no one else)".

On 2015-01-12, a blog post on the Ind.ie website entitled [https://ind.ie/blog/focus/ Focus] announced that the company would be switching towards building only Heartbeat, and making Heartbeat initially available only for Mac OS X, then on iOS. Plans to make it available for Android were shelved according to a follow-up post on [https://aralbalkan.com/notes/on-iteration/ Aral's personal site], which also stated: "Our ultimate goal is still to create a consumer device – which today we think will be a phone – with independent hardware, software, and services."

[https://forum.ind.ie/t/heartbeat-pre-alpha-release/740 The first Heartbeat pre-alpha] was released on 2015-08-10. As of this writing (2015-09-07), there have been eight other pre-alpha releases, including [https://forum.ind.ie/t/heartbeat-version-2015-08-15-scheming-squirrel-release/788 the Scheming Squirrel release] that showcased Heartbeat’s primitive yet developing indie web features.

'''As of 2017-02 Heartbeat is officially no longer under active development. [https://ind.ie/labs/]'''

Heartbeat’s source code ([https://source.ind.ie/project/heartbeat-cocoa Cocoa], [https://source.ind.ie/project/heartbeat-node Node.js]) is available on [https://source.ind.ie source.ind.ie]

Information on Heartbeat is available on the [https://forum.ind.ie/c/design-and-development/heartbeat Heartbeat section] of the [https://forum.ind.ie Ind.ie forum], including documents on the [https://forum.ind.ie/t/pre-alpha-conceptual-design/25 conceptual design], [https://forum.ind.ie/t/pre-alpha-technical-design/42 technical design], and [https://forum.ind.ie/t/heartbeat-known-issues/736 known issues].

==== Heartbeat self-description ====
Previous versions of the Ind.ie home page[https://ind.ie/##network+with+a+heart] had this description:

<blockquote>
''Heartbeat is a social network client that is private by default. It’s peer-to-peer and uses a distributed synchronisation engine called Pulse. You can use Heartbeat to share your thoughts, photos, or anything else privately across all your devices. You can also share privately with your friends, or publish publicly for the whole world to see via the Web.

You have full ownership and control.

Heartbeat is free as in freedom.

And it’s a beautiful, simple experience.''
</blockquote>

==== Heartbeat questions ====

* i'm more interested in how the experience is rather than technical details. like if I post privately where is the post stored. If I post publicly is it viewable on a URL. If so whose URL? Or is all of this stuck inside Heartbeat, in which case so much for freedom -- [[User:kartikprabhu.com|Kartik]] on [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-10-01#t1412199537860]
* more questions...

==== Heartbeat answers ====

Regarding the first question: [[User:kartikprabhu.com|Kartik]], the source is now available (please see links, above). Please download Heartbeat and have a play for yourself. Or, if you’d like, shoot me an email at aral@ind.ie and I’ll get you on the hosted version of Waystone that is part of the private pre-alpha programme. It’s very early days but I’m improving Heartbeat continuously. 

Regarding your questions on where posts/messages reside:

* Public messages: reside on your device and are served by a local (public) web server running at http://localhost:42000. These posts are also aggregated by the Waystone instance that you have an account handle from. For the private pre-alpha, this is [https://waystone.ind.ie waystone.ind.ie].

*Private messages: private messages are sent peer-to-peer between your device and the device of the friend you are talking to. Those are the only two places that they reside.

I hope that clears things up. If not, please feel free to ping me on the Ind.ie forum, reply here, or email me directly at aral@ind.ie. — [[User:aralbalkan.com|Aral]]

=== Pulse ===
* '''Pulse''' was the backend synchronisation engine for Heartbeat built on top of [[SyncThing]] to provide synchronisation between devices without any requirement of a central server.

<span id="not-indieweb"></span>
== Ind.ie is not IndieWeb nor IndieWebCamp ==
Despite the use of the word "indie", Ind.ie is separate from the indie web movement and from IndieWebCamp. The community around IndieWebCamp are individual developers, designers, web authors and creators who want to publish stuff on their own site. We're collectively building simple ways of sharing content between sites and providing backwards compatibility with [[silo]] services like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].

Aral has publicly noted that Ind.ie and indie web are not the same:

<blockquote>
<p>'''Are you the same as IndieWeb?'''</p>
<p>No. IndieWeb is a separate movement and yet we have some overlap of goals. Specifically, we share the belief that you should own your own space on the web. However, Indie Tech does not believe that this alone will fix the problem. In other words, the scope and focus of the two movements is different.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we reject the Silicon Valley startup culture of venture capital and exits. We see the spyware companies of Google, Facebook, etc. as harmful malware vendors. We reject any form of sponsorship or investment from them. The IndieWeb community makes no such claims and tries to work within the system to attempt to change the behaviour of the closed silos and provide tools to give themselves greater control over their own data.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our goal is to provide a separate, sustainable alternative ecosystem of independent technology. In this vision, I see IndieWeb as useful in creating stopgaps that can help smooth over the transition. If we sit and wait for the one perfect approach from the one perfect initiative, we will be sitting around and waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I am friends with a number of the people from the IndieWeb community and while we may not agree on everything, I know that their hearts are in the right place and that they’re doing what they’re doing for the right reasons.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, we are Indie Tech, the Independent Technology initiative, not IndieWeb.</p>
<p>I speak only for Indie Tech, not IndieWeb.</p>
<p>—Aral Balkan, <cite>[https://aralbalkan.com/notes/what-is-the-ind.ie-manifesto/ What is the ind.ie manifesto?]</cite></p>

A number of people on Twitter have confused the two names and attributed to the IndieWeb community positions which we do not subscribe to. To see what we ''do'' believe, check out the [[principles]] and [[why]] pages; to see what we're building have a look at [[projects]] and to see the kind of things that we're trying to work on, have a look at [[problems]].
