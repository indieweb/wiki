<blockquote>There's no legal reason behind Google's decision to block my daughter's account. They've chosen to implement these age restrictions in this particular way. They've chosen to lock up my daughter's data without warning. They've chosen to threaten to delete the data.</blockquote>

A message on the screen read: “Your account has been blocked for pretending to be someone else.”</p>[…]<p>On Dec. 2, a month after Ms. Baumann first appealed to Instagram to restore her account, '''The New York Times contacted Meta to ask why it had been shut down.''' An Instagram spokesman said that the account had been “incorrectly removed for impersonation” and would be restored. “We’re sorry this error occurred,” he wrote.</p><p>Two days later, the account was back online.</p></blockquote>'''Emphasis added.''' Restoring the account apparently required getting mainstream press to ask about it directly.


* Your '''identity is misrepresented''' by silos with no avenue to correct the false "facts," e.g.
** [http://amywilentz.tumblr.com/post/44228865923/google-killed-me Amy Wilentz: "Google Killed Me"].
** <blockquote>Facebook’s use of “ethnic affinity” as a proxy for race is a prime example. The platform’s interface does not offer users a way to self-identify according to race, but advertisers can nonetheless target people based on Facebook’s ascription of an “affinity” along racial lines. In other words. race is deployed as an externally assigned category for purposes of commercial exploitation and social control, not part of self-generated identity for reasons of personal expression. The ability to define one’s self and tell one’s own stories is central to being human and how one relates to others; platforms’ ascribing identity through data undermines both.</blockquote> -- via [http://reallifemag.com/friction-free-racism/ Friction-Free Racism] by Chris Gilliard, 2018-10-15
