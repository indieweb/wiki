** "@classicweb @evanI did the whole frontend (some backend for #identica). HTML, CSS, and no JavaScript.I take pride in that work b/c it was technically the "state of the art".Progressively enhanced; valid markup, alternate stylesheets, and a tonne of structured data directly from the webpages. Essentially enabling a read API.Something for the #microformats fans:https://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2009-February/012821.htmlhttps://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2009-February/012822.html>the best implementations of microformats in a social<br>media site#FediForum" [https://w3c.social/@csarven @csarven] June 5, 2025
