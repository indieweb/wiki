An '''<dfn>interview</dfn>''' is a [[post]] where the author publishes an interviewee's responses to questions.

Interviews may involve other people, or may be a self-interview, perhaps as part of a challenge like the [https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/ Blog Questions Challenge].

For documenting your own interviews, i.e. links to other people interviewing you, see:

* '''[[appearances]]'''

{{capjamesg}} has run two interview series on his blog:

* [https://jamesg.blog/coffee-interviews Coffee Interviews], in which he interviewed coffee professionals, and;
* [https://jamesg.blog/technical-writing-interviews Technical Writer Interviews], in which he interviewed technical writers on their day-to-day work.

When James has been interviewed by other bloggers, he has published a post that links to the original interview. ([https://jamesg.blog/2025/03/07/people-and-blogs-interview example]).

James sometimes archives his interviews published on other sites privately on his own site, too. This ensures that he can re-publish an interview in case the original site is no longer availbale.
