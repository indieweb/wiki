{{stub}}

IndieWeb sites often have a section on their [[home page]] that lists links to profile pages on social network [[silos]] and other forms of '''<dfn>identity elsewhere</dfn>'''.

== Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has a sidebar section on tantek.com with headings "Follow" and "Elsewhere" and use of [[rel="me"]] to link to silo profiles that can be followed (including an at-at username), and others that represent content and contributions elsewhere:
* https://tantek.com/#follow
* https://tantek.com/#elsewhere

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{schmarty}} has a header section on martymcgui.re labeled "Elsewhere on the web" with rel-me icon links to silo profiles

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} 2023-01-01: I moved this to a section of a new page, How to Follow Me:
* https://gregorlove.com/follow/#elsewhere

Previously: I've had different iterations of this on my [[contact]] page over the years, but it was just my [[Nintendo Switch]] friend code (text, no URL) from 2020 through 2023-01-01. I probably intended to add more links there but got distracted.

=== Jason Garber ===
{{jgarber}} has an Elsewhere section near the bottom of his homepage https://sixtwothree.org in a grid of rectangular links four columns wide that responsively shrinks the numbers of columns as you narrow the window
