{{stub}}

IndieWeb sites often have a section on their [[home page]] that lists links to profile pages on social network [[silos]] and other forms of '''<dfn>identity elsewhere</dfn>'''.

== Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has a sidebar section on tantek.com with heading "Elsewhere" and use of [[rel="me"]] to link to silo profiles

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{schmarty}} has a header section on martymcgui.re labeled "Elsewhere on the web" with rel-me icon links to silo profiles

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}}: I've had different iterations of this on my [[contact]] page over the years, but currently it is just my [[Nintendo Switch]] friend code (text, no URL) since 2020:
* https://gregorlove.com/contact/#switch

I probably intended to add more links there but got distracted.
