IndieWeb sites often have a section on their [[home page]] that lists links to profile pages on social network [[silos]] and other forms of '''<dfn>identity elsewhere</dfn>'''.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has a sidebar section on tantek.com with heading "Elsewhere" and use of [[rel="me"]] to link to silo profiles
=== Marty McGuire ===
{{schmarty}} has a header section on martymcgui.re labeled "Elsewhere on the web" with rel-me icon links to silo profiles
