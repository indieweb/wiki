{{note|This page is largely historical, there was no further iteration or interest in this topic. Kept for posterity.}}

'''<dfn>indieweb.txt</dfn>''' was a brainstorm proposal (discussed at [[2015/Brighton|IndieWebCamp Brighton 2015]]) for a plain-text-based [[well-known#something.txt|something.txt]] approach to allow IndieWeb site owners to share information about their tools, strategies, features, and motivations; there is at least one known implementation.

E.g.:
* IndieWeb tools they are using (e.g. [https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io The aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io webmention plugin for Jekyll-based sites], https://www.brid.gy/, etc.)
* IndieWeb 'strategies'
* [[IndieMark]] score (and potentially details of 'compliance' with each item within each level)
* notes on relevance of IndieWeb to personal web life (why one is embracing IndieWeb strategies, etc.)

== Why ==
* Sharing information on tools and practices across a growing movement, enabling interested people to discover which tools and strategies IndieWeb site owners are using
* Self-reflection: personal motivation to review one's own IndieMark occasionally
* Contributing to a better understanding of the evolution of the IndieWeb (also see: https://snarfed.org/indie-stats)

== Why not ==
There is already existing use and adoption of [[about]] and [[colophon]] pages that seem to satisfy most of these use-cases, including in practice.

== Examples ==
* [https://shellsharks.com/ Mike Sass] has an indieweb.txt published and linked from the main navigation:
** https://shellsharks.com/indieweb.txt ([http://web.archive.org/web/20240229195104/https://shellsharks.com/indieweb.txt archive])
** includes URL of this wiki page and sections for Tools, Strategies, [[IndieMark]] score, and Why

== Inspiration ==
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard robots.txt]
* [http://humanstxt.org/ humans.txt]
* [https://usesthis.com/ The Setup: "A nerdy little interview website, asking people what they use to get stuff done"] (source code available: https://github.com/waferbaby/usesthis/)

== Implementation ==
* Could be a free-form text file
* But ideally should at least have some basic structure (like robots.txt or humans.txt)
* Shouldn't probably be at a fixed, hardcoded location - a rel link tag could probably be used: e.g. <pre><link rel="indieweb" href="/some/where/indieweb.txt" /></pre>

== Brainstorming ==
From the brainstorming session at IndieWebCamp Brighton 2015:

* point to multiple structured resources describing tools/strategies/IndieMark 'compliance'
* see [http://rng.io/ RingMark] - both in terms of running automated checks and of visualizing in a very intuitive way the level of compliance
* extend the advertising items to include API endpoints to interact with the site (e.g. to post content, replies, etc. - this is mostly covered by existing strategies, but could be useful for ad-hoc APIs)

== Feedback ==
* HTML perhaps? Indie '''Web'''. ðŸ˜€ â€”[[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris.org]] 08:13, 12 July 2015 (PDT)
