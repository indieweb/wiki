The '''<dfn>indieweb</dfn>''' is about '''[[personal-domain|owning your domain]]''' and using it as '''[[How to set up web sign-in on your own domain|your primary identity]]''', to '''[[POSSE|publish on your own site]]''' (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and '''[[ownyourdata]]'''.

* You can have more than one such personal domain.
* You could use your own domain for purely a ''professional'' identity facet, preferring to keep anything personal off the internet/web. That's totally fine.

You might:
* Have an [[h-card]] on your '''[[home page]]''' with your contact info.
* Link to "other profiles" from your home page with '''[[rel=me]]'''.
* Use your '''domain as your identity''' with [[IndieAuth]].
* Appreciate indieweb '''[[principles]]'''

Content hosting possibilities
* You own your own domain but use [[Tumblr]].com or [[WordPress.com]] or some other '''hosted content solution''' to publish content (like [[posts]]) on your site. You own your permalinks so you can change hosting and (with some work) keep your permalinks working.
* You use a full-service '''web site hosting service''' and have them maintain a [[WordPress]] or other CMS install and databases for you.
* You use a [[web hosting]] service and '''maintain your own''' WordPress or other CMS [[project]] install, backup your content (files and/or databases) etc.

Not indieweb:
* Just having a subdomain on a content hosting site, e.g. person1.blogger.com, person2.wordpress.com, etc. They still own your permalinks.
* Just having a profile page on a content hosting [[silo]], e.g. twitter.com/person1 flickr.com/person2
* In both cases you're still subject to their policies on names and they could trivially give your name/identity away, e.g. as [http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/04/27/tumblr-disappeared-me.html what happened with danah boyd] and zephoria.tumblr.com (which she did get back), or [http://infovore.org/archives/2011/06/12/wheres-towerbridge/ the Tower Bridge] on twitter.com/towerbridge
