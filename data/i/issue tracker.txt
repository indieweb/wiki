{{stub}}

An '''<dfn>issue tracker</dfn>''' is a place to post and discuss [[issue]]s like bugs & feature requests.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members that use an issue tracker on their personal site:

* {{ds}} hosts the [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/issues/github.com/shurcooL/issuesapp?state=all canonical issue tracker] for <code>issuesapp</code> on his website.<br>He also hosts issue trackers for self-hosted Go packages on his website (e.g., https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/text/kebabcase/...$issues).

* add yourself...

== Software ==
Software you can use to host your own issue tracker:

* [https://github.com/shurcooL/issuesapp <code>issuesapp</code>] - a simple issue tracker, compatible with GitHub issue tracker.
** Find various <code>issues.Service</code> implementations in subdirectories of https://github.com/shurcooL/issues, including filesystem- and GitHub API-based implementations.

== Silo examples ==
=== GitHub ===
* [[GitHub]] provides an issue tracker for each repo
=== Jira ===
Jira provides an issue tracking / project management service.

** "i sent my anonymous friend at atlassian this tweet and iâ€™ve been informed that the jira team uses post-it walls to organise.. jira development https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1291839437802844160?s=21" [https://patternsinthevoid.net @isislovecruft] August 9, 2020

** "man goes to doctor. says he's depressed. says work is overwhelming. everything is disorganized, swamped with bureaucracy.<br><br>"use the app JIRA" says doctor. "It'll help your organization keep track of work."<br><br>"but doc," says the man. "I work on JIRA."" [http://www.tessera.li @tesseralis] August 7, 2020


== Brainstorming ==

<b>TODO:</b> Capture brainstorming starting at http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-05-17#t1431887181504

After the above discussion, there were undiscussed suggestions to generalize from "issue" to "[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-05-17/line/1431918555923 request]" or "[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-08-20#t1440102751712 todo]".

<blockquote>
Vendan: [...] I'd almost steer towards a more generic noun then issue, like request. You could have feature requests, bugfix requests, even patch requests(with code patch attached). Also opens it up to making requests on people instead of projects, which would be an interesting idea
</blockquote>

* The ^^^ above IRC discussion appears to be nearly completely theoretical handwaving. I'd advise anyone actually interested in trying to solve this problem to start by actually posting some of the elemental types of content involved on their own site with permalinks, e.g., before solving "issue tracker", I challenge you to prove your real-world interest by first:
** 1. post [[reply]] posts <em>on your own site</em> in reply to GitHub issues, and then [[POSSE]] them to GitHub. Only two people are doing this currently:
*** [[GitHub#Aaron_Parecki|Aaron Parecki]] (see inside for permalinks)
*** [[GitHub#Colin_Tedford|Colin Tedford]]
** 2. post a new issue as a [[reply]] post <em>on your own site</em> in reply to a code repo on GitHub (or an indieweb site that has a code repo itself per previous point). Only one person is doing this currently:
*** [[GitHub#Colin_Tedford|Colin Tedford]] (see inside for permalinks)
** 3. post [[code]] to <em>on your own site</em>, and then [[POSSE]] it to GitHub. A few people are doing this:
*** [[code#IndieWeb_Examples]]
** ... start with those three to start understanding the problem space, because otherwise all talk of naming "issue" vs "request" vs "todo" is just timewasting bikeshedding, and all other abstractions being discussed are essentially [[architecture astronomy]]. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 16:46, 20 August 2015 (PDT)

=== Discourage antipatterns ===
An issue tracker would ideally discourage various [[antipattern]] behaviors in issues, or at least raise a higher bar for prioritizing / doing them. E.g.
==== bikeshedding ====
Discourage bikeshedding (as referenced above)
==== yak shaving ====
