'''<dfn>indorsements</dfn>''' is a portmanteau of "IndieWeb Endorsements," coined by {{gwg}} at the [[2016/NYC2|IndieWebCamp NYC 2016]] session of the [[2016/NYC2/indorsements|same name]].

{{gwg}} revisited the issue at IWC NYC 2018 badges session(https://etherpad.indieweb.org/badges) and wrote a proposal for a workflow for endorsements, badges, and similar assertions(https://david.shanske.com/2018/09/28/thoughts-about-assertion-workflows/)
