{{stub}}

'''<dfn>indie post discovery</dfn>''' is an expansion of [[original post discovery]] that focuses on finding the indie post for any particular [[silo]] post, regardless of whether the indie post was created originally, or via [[PESOS]], or backfilled import of an export.

== Why ==
This is a useful distinction because:

# "original post" should still mean something (and we should still keep pushing to [[POSSE]] over PESOS as much as possible).
# "indie post discovery" puts the emphasis on indie, which helps make it clear that indieweb posts are preferred over silos posts in general
