'''<dfn>[https://indieweb.social/ indieweb.social]</dfn>''' is a [[Mastodon]] instance that has (semi?)open sign-ups so anyone (like beyond the community) might have an account there, and was started with the intent of adding and enabling [https://spec.indieweb.org/ IndieWeb standards] as proof of how Mastodon could [[federate]] with sites in general, beyond 
other Mastodon sites.

<blockquote>"#Admin #IndieWebSocial A thread: üßµ  With a few significant mid-level Mastodon servers shutting down (Mastodon.lol) - or just narrowly averting a shutdown (Mastodon.au) - I thought it was necessary to make this note, which we sent to this server's patrons: "Indieweb.Social has been operational since 2019 and is a labor of love meant to be a lifeboat and incubator for the creation of a better social media ecosystem than what we have all experienced in recent years....1 of X" <cite style="display:block; text-align:right" class="h-cite">[https://indieweb.social/@tchambers @tchambers] <time class="dt-published">2023-02-16</time></cite></blockquote>

[https://twitter.com/air_5ive/status/1594892232741601280 Q]: Is https://indieweb.social/ on [[Mastodon]] associated with the IndieWeb community?

A: indieweb.social is maintained by long time IndieWeb community members, and was created from discussions on the IndieWeb [[discuss|chat groups]].

Like many related resources & services, it‚Äôs not a formal [[project]] of the IndieWeb community, yet is strongly aligned.

** "‚û°Ô∏è #Admin #Indiewebsocial With news of the probable launch of Meta's #Project92  I wanted to make clear this servers policy:"Don't preemptively strike meta w/ a fediblock, but stay vigilant with eyes wide open and a finger on the block button."  The same as we do for all servers.They can be blocked instantly if they violate our terms of use, and as admins are in a far stronger position if we do so than vs before.I hope all #fediadmins to consider taking this same policy.  1 of X üßµ" [https://indieweb.social/@tchambers @tchambers] June 19, 2023
