'''<dfn>indieweb.social</dfn>''' is a [[Mastodon]] instance that has (semi?)open sign-ups so anyone (like beyond the community) might have an account there, and was started with the intent of adding and enabling [https://spec.indieweb.org/ IndieWeb standards] as proof of how Mastodon could [[federate]] with sites in general, beyond other Mastodon sites.
