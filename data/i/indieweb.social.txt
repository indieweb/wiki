** "#Admin #IndieWebSocial A thread: 🧵  With a few significant mid-level Mastodon servers shutting down (Mastodon.lol) - or just narrowly averting a shutdown (Mastodon.au) - I thought it was necessary to make this note, which we sent to this server's patrons: "Indieweb.Social has been operational since 2019 and is a labor of love meant to be a lifeboat and incubator for the creation of a better social media ecosystem than what we have all experienced in recent years....1 of X" [https://indieweb.social/@tchambers @tchambers] February 16, 2023

** "➡️ #Admin #Indiewebsocial With news of the probable launch of Meta's #Project92  I wanted to make clear this servers policy:"Don't preemptively strike meta w/ a fediblock, but stay vigilant with eyes wide open and a finger on the block button."  The same as we do for all servers.They can be blocked instantly if they violate our terms of use, and as admins are in a far stronger position if we do so than vs before.I hope all #fediadmins to consider taking this same policy.  1 of X 🧵" [https://indieweb.social/@tchambers @tchambers] June 19, 2023
