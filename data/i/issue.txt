    '''<dfn>issue</dfn>''' is a special kind of [[article]] post that is a [[reply]] to typically some source [[code]], though potentially anything at a source control repository. 

== Why ==
You should post issues on your own site first because [[GitHub]] goes down sometimes for various reasons. And then [[POSSE]] to GitHub.

__TOC__
== How ==
TBD. Analyze the examples below and document some brainstorming!

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} occasionally posts issues on aaronparecki.com syndicated to GitHub.com

=== Chris Aldrich ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} often posts issues to his own [http://stream.boffosocko.com/content/all/?q=github website] as simple [[note|notes]] (or replies to issues as simple [[reply|replies]]) and automatically POSSEs them to GitHub repos using the [https://github.com/mapkyca/KnownGithub Github plugin] for [[Known]].
* On [http://boffosocko.com/2018/02/28/first-reply-to-github-with-bridgy-publish/ 2018-02-28], {{chrisaldrich}} used the functionality provided by the [[Bridgy Publish plugin]] for WordPress to use [[Bridgy]] to [[POSSE]] a [[reply]] to a [https://github.com/dshanske/bridgy-publish/issues/56#issuecomment-369372604 GitHub issue] from his own site. He received his first [[backfeed|backfed]] reply from GitHub via [[bridgy]] on [http://boffosocko.com/2018/02/28/first-reply-to-github-with-bridgy-publish/#comment-47091 2018-03-02].
* Now that [[Post Kinds Plugin]] supports [[issues|issue]] posts, he'll begin publishing those via [[POSSE]] from his primary [[WordPress]] website as well. He published his first official issue via [[POSSE]] on his primary site on [http://boffosocko.com/2018/03/02/support-for-acquisition-kind/ 2018-03-02]. A feed of all his issues can be found at http://boffosocko.com/kind/issue/
