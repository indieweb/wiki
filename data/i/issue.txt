    '''<dfn>issue</dfn>''' is a special kind of [[article]] post that is a [[reply]] to typically some source [[code]], though potentially anything at a source control repository. 

== Why ==
You should post issues on your own site first because [[GitHub]] goes down sometimes for various reasons. And then [[POSSE]] to GitHub.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} often posts issues to his own [http://stream.boffosocko.com/content/all/?q=github website] as simple [[note|notes]] (or replies to issues as simple [[reply|replies]]) and automatically POSSEs them to GitHub repos using the [https://github.com/mapkyca/KnownGithub Github plugin] for [[Known]]. 

== Silo Examples ==
=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] allows posting of issues as part of their [[issue tracker]] feature for each repo.
