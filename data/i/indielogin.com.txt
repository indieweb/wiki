'''<dfn>[https://indielogin.com indielogin.com]</dfn>''' is a service that developers can use to log users in to a website. 

The developer creates a [[web sign-in]] form that asks for the user's domain, and it directs people to indielogin.com to authenticate. Users can authenticate by linking to one or more existing authentication providers such as Twitter, GitHub, or the user's own [[IndieAuth]] server.

== Demo ==
