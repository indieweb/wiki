{{stub}}


'''<dfn>in-reply-to</dfn>''' is the [[h-entry]] property to use in a [[post]] that is a [[reply]] to another post. The reply post must hyperlink to the original post with <code>class="u-in-reply-to"</code>.

The <code>in-reply-to</code> property supersedes [[rel-in-reply-to]]. For more information, see [[rel-values]].

Additionally:
* The in-reply-to link is typically inside the [[reply-context]] of a reply post
* The microformats2 <code>u-in-reply-to h-cite</code> class names can also be used to embed a [[reply-context]] with more details beyond the URL

== How to consume in-reply-to ==
Summary: collect an ordered list of unique in-reply-to URLs by checking and adding from:
# the first h-entry for "in-reply-to" URLs (including embedded)

=== algorithm ===
Given a URL of a post, to determine the URL(s) itâ€™s in-reply-to:

* Let <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> be an empty list
* Parse the post's HTML for microformats2. If there are any h-entries, get the first one
** If the h-entry has an in-reply-to property, for each item in its array of values:
*** If the item is a string, append it to <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> if not already there
*** If the item is an embedded microformat, check if it has a ''url'' property. If it does, append the first url property value to <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> if not already there
*** Otherwise ignore the item
* <var>in-reply-to-urls</var> is now a list of all the URLs the parsed URL is in-reply-to

You may use a different algorithm if it produces exactly the same results. E.g. you could skip checking "if not already there" conditions, and instead at the end perform a step of "* Remove duplicate values from <var>in-reply-to-urls</var>" - as long as you removed latter duplicates, and kept first occurrences in the list.

==Usage Examples==

* [[tantek]] uses <code>u-in-reply-to</code> along with <code>h-cite</code> to mark-up reply notes. E.g. [http://tantek.com/2014/042/t3/learned-made-irc-wiki-works-hentry-hreview]

== FAQ ==
=== Must an in-reply-to link be inside an h-entry ===
''Q: Does an in-reply-to link have to be inside an h-entry?''

A: '''Yes.''' An in-reply-to link must be inside the h-entry with class name of <code>u-in-reply-to</code> so that it can be recognized as a URL property of the h-entry.

== Past Research ==
See:
* http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-in-reply-to
For the research and development of the <code>u-in-reply-to</code> property and <code>rel=in-reply-to</code>.
