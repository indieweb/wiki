'''<dfn>[https://indieweb.me indieweb.me]</dfn>''' is just a french experience inspired by the MotherWiki designed by Alex Schroeder in Zurich. An IndieWebFarm that will **encourages its children to leave on the indieweb.** 

cf https://communitywiki.org/wiki/MotherWiki


The domain "indieweb.me" has been bought at Gandi by [[User:Christopheducamp.com]]. 
The hosting is based in Portugal at masto.host (contact Hugo) for a small plan (100 users max). 

I built https://indieweb.me to have fun w/ my children (I hope, instagram generation...), help the indieweb mission, learn to admin an hosted instance and test [[mastodon]]'s admin UI. 

Just a very low cost, to see if it “works.” If it works, (that is, if people like mastodon, find that it’s useful, are productive with it,) then the people can think more seriously about operating their own domain, and get started on the indieweb. 

I will support and will be focused around my children and their friends. Not sure I will succeed. Thinking around one to one approach via dinner.

== Seeding ==

I Feel responsable of maintaining a high level of moderation. I'm focused to invite people able to moderate and admin. 


Currently 7 users. Some could be minor. I feel I have to flooded. And must be quiet now to let the social system go.


The administration is shared with an indieweb member http://jgregorymcverry.com/ and Olivier Auber. Both have not a lot of time to invest in welcoming the newcomers.

== Mission statement ==

Description to be written in French with the help of the indieweb community. 


== confusion w/ indieweb.org ==

* Warning added : on home page. You can monitor the editorial via a test account dedicated  (@FormationXtof linked via moa.party)
* Taked today w/ Patrick Rhone around GTD.No planning, no roadmap.


=== Mastodon ===

Hugo and I are interested to implement 

* webmentions. To be discussed in the future. I've not the technical skills to help around webmentions. This is a point to explore w/ Nicolas Hoizey 
* indielogin with my indieweb.me/@xtof URL. Connexion but no access in writing.
* social pages : welcome visitor, [[now]] page will be written in french on my personal family wiki powered by mediawiki and linked via interwiki.

== [[micro.blog]] ==

... I'm currently thinking to produce a daily GTD-[[now]] page (photo post + note) to show my social design to Patrick Rhone on the [[micro.blog]] timeline. 


`microblog.indieweb.me` could be fun and easily implemented. 

== wiki ==

my personal wiki (ducamp.me) is reserved for personal and family use. 
I don't plan to use it for all users. Thinking of small wikis easy to implement. 

`wiki.indieweb.com` for admin and moderations.
 


== Discussion et contact ==

Sorry for my english. My native language is fr. 
I've written without sleep since... too much time.

Tomorrow, I will be quiet. 

And happy to pitch this alpha-stuff tomorrow.

Merci et bonne soirée

Really ready to share access for DNS (Gandi) + Mastodon Admin
