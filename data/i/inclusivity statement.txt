== IndieWeb Diversity and Inclusion Statement ==
The IndieWeb Community has a commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive web.  We celebrate multiple approaches and points of view online. In fact we believe diversity drives innovation and personal websites protect this diversity. A multilingual web that provides safe space for all peoples helps society as a whole.

So we’re building a culture where difference is valued. We take a holistic approach and help each other maintain our own sites to own our identity and celebrate our culture. We’re always growing our network of people, building blocks, and events. 

=== All IndieWeb Events ===
* All IndieWebCamp events have a Code of Conduct and Accessibility statement
* IndieWebCamp events are open to all skill levels
* Every IndieWeb event is all ages
* All event venues are alcohol free.
