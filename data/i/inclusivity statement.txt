== Why ==
(this section is a stub and needs expansion)
There are many reasons to have an explicit inclusivity statement, here are some, not in any order (or presence/absence) of importance. Please add more!

== DRAFT ==
The below '''IndieWeb Diversity and Inclusion Statement''' has been drafted at the Berlin Organizers meeting and needs [[Organizers]] feedback and likely discussion at the next Organizers meetup to approve for general use at IndieWeb events.
* GOAL: Get something agreed and published before [[2019|IndieWeb Summit 2019]]!
* PRIMARY AUTHORS: {{jgmac1106}}, {{t}} (noted for transparency of presence of viewpoints / opinions, not credit, nor ownership)

Organizers: please feel free to provide feedback, and if you like, adapt this statement to your own events until there's consensus for a general IndieWeb events Diversity and Inclusion Statement. 

== IndieWeb Diversity and Inclusion Statement ==
The IndieWeb Community has a commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive web.  We celebrate multiple approaches and points of view online. In fact we believe diversity drives innovation and personal websites protect this diversity. A multilingual web that provides safe space for all peoples helps society as a whole.

So we’re building a culture where difference is valued. We take a holistic approach and help each other maintain our own sites to own our identity and celebrate our culture. We’re always growing our network of people, building blocks, and events. 

=== All IndieWeb Events ===
* All IndieWebCamp events have a Code of Conduct and Accessibility statement
* All IndieWebCamp events are open to all skill levels
* Every IndieWeb event is all ages
* All IndieWeb events strive to reduce our impact on the climate crisis
* All IndieWeb events and event venues are strongly encouraged to be alcohol-free
* All IndieWeb events may have social activities at venues that serve alcohol but consumption should never be primary focus of event/
* All IndieWeb events recognize that systematic racism and sexism have lead to exclusionary practices in open source technology and organizers make every effort to  increase participation among previously excluded voices.

=== Details ===
* '''All IndieWeb events and event venues are strongly encouraged to be alcohol-free.'''
** '''We are a volunteer-run community.''' Organizers are themselves volunteers and our venues are typically donated, sponsored, or sometimes just a table at a cafe or bar (many [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups). We encourage organizers to find safe, friendly, and accessible venues for all.
** '''We prefer alcohol-free venues.''' Organizers: If there’s a choice of venue, please pick one without alcohol.
** '''We avoid serving alcohol.''' Organizers: Please avoid serving alcohol during IndieWeb events. You may encourage participants to self-organize if they wish to go out after an event and choose a destination themselves.
** '''In order to reduce the climate impact of events organizers should serve make meal choices primarily vegetarian or vegan.
** '''Many IndieWeb members have diet restrictions due to medical, religious, or personal choices. All organizers will respect the choices of attendees and make every reasonable accommodation if providing food at an event. 
** '''Organizers should try to plan IndieWeb events around adjacent events already requiring travel in order to reduce the climate impact of airplane travel.
** '''Remote attendees are equal attendees and every effort is made to enable two way communication and participation. Remote participation reduces the need for travel and increases attendance among marginalized parents.
** '''All IndieWeb events are breast feeding friendly. Organizers should check with venues to see if lactation rooms are provided if a mother prefers privacy.
** '''Travel assistance funds help people from underrepresented groups attend IndieWeb events. This includes direct travel or providing child care assistance for remote attendees

Re: " All events and event venues are alcohol free."
* '''Historically inaccurate.''' Regardless of how we state this, we should not state something that has not been 100% true in the past. Historically many IndieWeb events or meetups have been at venues that informally have alcohol (like some offices), or formally (like some bars/cafes), though many (most?) IndieWeb events have been alcohol free.
* '''Non-disruptive.''' some venues (e.g. sipgate) have alcohol in small quantities in refrigerators, which has not been disruptive. this should be ok.
* '''Locking up option.''' some venues have ways of easily storing or locking up any venue alcohol for the duration of the event (e.g. Mozilla Berlin), which we have successfully done a multiple times (IndieWebCamps Berlin 2018 and 2019).

Counter-proposal:
* '''All IndieWeb events and event venues are strongly encouraged to be alcohol-free.'''
** '''We are a volunteer-run community.''' Organizers are themselves volunteers and our venues are typically donated, sponsored, or sometimes just a table at a cafe or bar (many [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups). We encourage organizers to find safe, friendly, and accessible venues for all.
** '''We prefer alcohol-free venues.''' Organizers: If there’s a choice of venue, please pick one without alcohol.
** '''We avoid serving alcohol.''' Organizers: Please avoid serving alcohol during IndieWeb events. You may encourage participants to self-organize if they wish to go out after an event and choose a destination themselves.
