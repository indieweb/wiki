An '''<dfn>index</dfn>''' is an organized list of information on a personal website potentially consisting of [[tag]]s/categories, [[articles]], [[location]]s, authors or related information to make it easier to find particular content on a site. Indexes might be either a [[page]] or a programmatically created [[archive]] data.

These are digital equivalents of indices often found in books (topics, people) or analog library card catalogs (people, titles, subjects).
