'''<dfn>[http://imgur.com imgur]</dfn>''' is an image hosting [[silo]] that seems to ironically [[js;dr|depend on js]] to show you an image, except for http://s.imgur.com/images/loaders/ddddd1_181817/48.gif.

== Compliments ==

Like a lot of Silo's Imgur makes it quite trivial to post images, including anonymously via their API

== Criticism ==

Can have quite a childish audience and problematic interactions. [https://imgur.com/r/MensRights/SxSnn5h NSFW, potentially triggering: case and point]
