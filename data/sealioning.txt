<dfn>'''sealioning'''</dfn> is a term for intrusive attempts to engage someone with questions and requests for evidence for their claims. The questioner is typically unknown to the person and only gets involved by way of a hashtag or search term. The term originated from the Wondermark comic “The Terrible Sea Lion”[http://wondermark.com/1k62/] in response to GamerGate tactics.
