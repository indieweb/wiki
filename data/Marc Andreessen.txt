== essay tweeting ==
Recently Marc is known for "tweeting" an essay by numbering sequential tweets that are part of a set.

Others have collected his sequences of tweets into essay posts:
* http://pmarcatweetsasblogposts.tumblr.com/ - nicely reformatted into paragraphs
* http://yvoschaap.com/pmarca/ - just point by point lists of tweet sequences

== request to use his blog ==
[[Tim Bray]] asked[https://twitter.com/timbray/status/475735598628474881]: <blockquote>How about someone set up a blog for @pmarca - his stuff would be way easier to read. And thereâ€™d be a persistent link to it.</blockquote> specifically in the context of Marc's tweets, which he could presumably concatenate into a blog post on his blog if he wanted to.

From an indieweb perspective, why does Marc blog as a series of tweets instead of on his own blog?

== blog archive ==
