{{stub}}

'''<dfn>OPML</dfn>''' stands for Outline Processor Markup Language, an [[XML]]-based format and defacto standard used for [[feed]] lists interchange.

== Silo Examples ==

Examples of [[silos]] that allow importing and exporting OPML files.

=== YouTube ===

[[YouTube]] allows people to export their subscriptions as an OPML file, which can then be used to subscribe any news reader to the channels they are subscribed to.

== Brainstorming ==

In the context of IndieWeb, the idea of OPML could be interesting as a representation of whom you [[follow]]. Since it is supported by a variety of sources, It could be a good candidate to solve the "how do you discover people" question.

The advantage of using OPML is its support, however, like [[RSS]], the standard has some limitations.

Alternative: publish a visible [[blogroll]] on the home page or somewhere on your site and mark it up with [[XFN]].

=== Sharing via OPML ===
If you want to show to the world who you follow, you can share an opml file on your website.
