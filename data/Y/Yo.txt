'''<dfn>Yo</dfn>''' (<nowiki>www.justyo.co</nowiki>) was a mobile [[app]] for sending your contacts the text "Yo" that shut down in 2016.[https://mashable.com/article/yo-app-patreon-shut-down-crowdfunding-or-arbel] A "yo" is also a method of grabbing the attention of someone to potentially start a conversation. 

== Yo the App ==

Yo, now defunct, let you send the word "Yo" to anyone who was in your contacts list.

=== API ===
The Yo API can be used to send a "yo" to all subscribers of a Yo account.

Users are subscribed by sending a "yo" to the account.

<blockquote>Some example use cases: A blog can Yo the readers whenever a new post is published. Imagine getting a Yo From PRODUCTHUNT.</blockquote> 

From the Yo Developer API doc [https://medium.com/@YoAppStatus/yo-developers-api-e7f2f0ec5c3c]

== Yo in the IndieWeb ==

A Yo is a way to catch someone's attention. You may want to send a Yo from your personal website. A yo is analogous to "hello" or the old Facebook "poke" feature.

A yo may also be sent in jest as a response to a piece of internet history, the Yo app.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

{{capjamesg}} published a Yo on his website that linked to Kevin Marks' website. The post was sent as a webmention so the Yo would be received by Kevin.

Here is the Yo on James' blog:
