'''<dfn>YAGNI</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for <dfn>You Aren't Gonna Need It</dfn> (or <dfn>You '''Ain't''' Gonna Need It</dfn>), itself essentially a rephrasing of Occam’s razor; IndieWeb [[principles]] <em>[[make what you need]]</em> & <em>[[use what you make]]</em> help you focus on creating, using, & iterating beneficial things you do need (and want) as a method of deprioritizing and avoiding the things you don’t need.
