'''<dfn>Yarns Microsub Server</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>Yarns</dfn>''' for short, is a [[Microsub]] Server plugin for [[WordPress]].  It can be used to follow feeds formatted using [[microformats]], [[RSS]], or [[JSON_Feed]].  It can be used with Microsub clients such as [[Indigenous]], [[Monocle]], and [[Together]]

Yarns is built by [[User:Jackjamieson.net|Jack Jamieson]]. 

The WordPress plugin is not yet available in the main repository (yet), but can be downloaded from [https://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server Github]. [https://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server Issues can be filed here] as well.

== Installation ==
Instructions for installing and using Yarns are posted on [https://jackjamieson.net/yarns-microsub-server-getting-started-guide/ Jack Jamieson's website].

== Development ==
Yarns relies on the [https://github.com/dshanske/parse-this Parse This] library created by {{GWG}}.

== History ==
Yarns Microsub Server was forked from an earlier reader project, [[Yarns_Indie_Reader]], which was based in part on {{acegiak}}'s [[WhisperFollow]] with inspiration by [[Woodwind]].

Yarns Indie Reader is still available on [https://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-indie-reader GitHub], though no further development is planned. Instructions for installing the old version of Yarns can currently be found here: http://jackjamieson.net/yarns-indie-reader/
