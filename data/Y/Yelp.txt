=== Content Guidelines ===

A few notes from their content guidelines

*  Reviews aren’t the place for rants about political ideologies, a business’s employment practices, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don’t address the core of the consumer experience.
* Your contributions should be unbiased and objective. For example, you shouldn’t write reviews of your own business or employer, your friends’ or relatives’ business, your peers or competitors in your industry, or businesses in your networking group. Businesses should never ask customers to write reviews.
* Don’t swipe content from other sites, users, or businesses. You’re a smart cookie, so write your own copy and share your own photos and videos.
* The best reviews are personal, passionate, and reflect your consumer experience. They offer a rich narrative, a wealth of detail, and a helpful tip or two for other consumers. 
* We want to hear about your firsthand experience, not what you heard from your partner or co-worker, or what you saw in the news. 
*  Make sure your review is factually correct. Feel free to air your opinions, but don’t exaggerate or misrepresent your experience. 
*  You should not threaten to post or offer to remove a negative review as a way to extract payment from a business.
* Review updates should reflect a new experience or interaction with the business. Don’t keep posting about the same old story you’ve already told.
