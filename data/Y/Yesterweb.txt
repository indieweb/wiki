== [https://yesterweb.org/about/ What role does nostalgia play in the Yesterweb?] ==


<blockquote cite="https://yesterweb.org/about/">It's fun to be nostalgic about old design choices and aesthetics. There’s a lot of comfort in nostalgia, but’s more of an 'icing' than a 'cake'. We aren't blind to the shortcomings of the early web, instead we see the potential that was lost. And sometimes we just want to dress up our websites!</blockquote>
