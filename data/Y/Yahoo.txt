== Issues ==
=== Concerns about closing down services ===
Yahoo! [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/technology/yahoo-alibaba-spinoff.html announced on 2015-12-10] that they will spin all the core services to a separate company and keep solely shareholdings of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan in the main company profile.

This could soon lead to closing down services that are not generating profit, however, the concerns are yet to be addressed.

=== Privacy ===
<blockquote style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Yahoo Inc last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company complied with a classified U.S. government demand, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, said three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events.

...

They were also upset that Mayer and Yahoo General Counsel Ron Bell did not involve the company's security team in the process, instead asking Yahoo's email engineers to write a program to siphon off messages containing the character string the spies sought and store them for remote retrieval, according to the sources.
