'''<dfn>[http://yaml.org/ YAML]</dfn>''' ('''Y'''AML '''A'''in't '''M'''arkup '''L'''anguage) is a data serialization standard.

== History == 

YAML was created to be a human-readable data serialization language that was also computationally powerful. The original authors designed it with international support from the start and a focus to be everything that XML was not at the time in 2001. The two facets of YAML were created independantly by two groups who them merged their efforts to be the YAML we all know today.

** "YAML: the result of people ignoring the lessons from JSON (the result of people ignoring the lessons from XML). Now we’re ‘coding’ infra with 3000 line typeless, indentationsensitive markup, escaping it, then embed it in another 3000 line typeless, indentationsensitive file."
