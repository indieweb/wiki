'''<dfn>[http://youtube.com YouTube]</dfn>''' is a [[video]] hosting [[silo]] that has known [[#Issues|issues]].

== How to ==
=== How to export your data ===
Youtube has the following content from users:
* video posts
* list of subscriptions to YouTube channels
* [[comment]]s on videos
* [[like]]s of videos
* history of videos [[watch]]ed

Has anyone successfully exported all of these? In what format(s)? 

Any luck importing to your own site (PESOS)? Or start POSSEing instead?

Export:
* There was a watch history in the API, but this [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/revision_history#september-15-2016 was removed September 15, 2016]. A partial history can still be downloaded through [https://www.google.com/settings/takeout Google Takeout].
* Export on-YouTube subscriptions as an [[OPML]] file that can be imported/used by [[feed reader|feed readers]]. This export option can be found in [https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager the subscription manager]. 
Limitation: the OPML just links to XML feeds (not sure if it contains actual data about the channels you are subscribed to)

Feeds:
* Does YouTube have feeds for users to download their content?

== Features ==
=== Permalink UI ===
Here's an example screenshot of YouTube's UI as of 2013-286 with apparent features
[[File:YouTube video permalink 2013-10-13.png]]

Live permalink: http://youtu.be/0NUbLJ-Q3Ck

With:
* '''video as primary content''' - just below "YouTube" banner with search box (scrolled off the top)
* '''name''' of video <em>below</em> the primary content, ellipsed at width of video content.
* '''author''' with photo, name, number of videos posted, subscribe [[webaction]] and subscriber count, clustered and left-aligned under the video name
* '''counts''' related to the video, right-aligned with right edge of video, including:
** '''views count''' 
** '''thumb up down counts'''
* '''thumb up "Like" thumb down''' props/unprops [[webaction]] buttons
* '''tabbed navigation''' among
** '''About''' '''Share''' '''Add to''' '''Transcript (menu? icon)''' '''Statistics (bar chart icon)''' '''Report (flag icon)'''
* '''Share''' section appears to be the default which itself has subsections for:
** '''Share this video''' '''Embed''' '''Email'''
** [[webactions]] icons for posting a link to video on:
*** [[Twitter]] [[G+]] [[Blogger]] [[Reddit]] [[Tumblr]] [[Pinterest]] [[StumbleUpon]] A-Russian-silo [[LinkedIn]]
** '''text input field with youtu.be shortlink''' in a larger font
** '''checkbox to start at''' currently paused time-offset, to the right of text input
* '''Comments''' section with count in parentheses next to heading "(0)"
** '''Sign in''' link prompt "to post a comment!"

=== Atom feeds ===
Unlike many silos, YouTube makes atom [[feed|feeds]] available for all channels. 

Feed discoverability has been a problem, but URLs are [https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/98210709ff9a3a4f15d66d9dc027a24456af5103/app/models/youtube_options.rb easily mapped] to their feed equivalents by hand:

* <code><nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/channel/</nowiki><b>ID</b></code> → <code><nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=</nowiki><b>ID</b></code>
* <code><nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/user/</nowiki><b>ID</b></code> → <code><nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?user=</nowiki><b>ID</b></code>
* <code><nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=</nowiki><b>ID</b></code> → <code><nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=</nowiki><b>ID</b></code>

=== Subtitle Editor ===
YouTube provides tools for creating subtitles and translations for videos.

Videos can accept community contributions of subtitles or translations. After a translation is submitted, the owner can review the contribution and request changes, make changes themselves, or publish it.

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to delete your account ===
TBD.

Has anyone deleted their YouTube account? What's the process? How long do they hold your data anyway? Etc.

=== How to POSSE ===
TBD.

Is anyone [[POSSE]]ing to YouTube?


== Issues ==
=== Content Deletion ===
YouTube has been known for deleting content that has been posted there:
* http://www.rebelliouspixels.com/2013/buffy-vs-edward-remix-unfairly-removed-by-lionsgate
=== Content Reappropriation ===
YouTube has also re-appropriated content without permission, transferring ownership to big media companies claiming copyright:
* http://waxy.org/2012/03/youtube_bypasses_the_dmca/

=== Content ID ===

YouTube's [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en Content ID] system automatically scans all uploads against a database of content submitted by "content owners".

This system has been [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/congrats-10-year-anniversary-youtube-now-please-fix-content-id subject to] [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/content-id-and-rise-machines many kinds of abuse].

==== Copyright Claim ====

===== Copyright claim on unmatched audio =====
* on 2015-08-07 {{aaronpk}} livestreamed an event which was recorded to Youtube
* on 2015-08-10 Aaron noticed that Youtube placed ads on the video because of a copyright claim.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-08-10#t1439224857562] The part of the video in question was from timecode [https://youtu.be/uJov2cohGvQ?t=5s 0:05 to 1:56], the very beginning of the livestream, where the video is mostly dead air.
* the same day, Aaron filed a dispute on the claim
* on 2015-09-02 Aaron checked back on Youtube (since no notifications were being sent about any of this) and noticed that the copyright page now showed a link "Appeal rejected dispute". He submitted an appeal to the rejected dispute. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-02#t1441223499446] [https://farm1.staticflickr.com/624/21094658515_faf9bbd510_o.png]

===== Copyright claim on video =====
* on 2016-01-03 {{aaronpk}} posted [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9hF3PO-S90 a video] on Youtube that was original music with a mashup of The Office trailer and scenes from 
* within minutes, Youtube sent a notice that the video was no longer available for viewing due to a copyright claim on the contents of the images
* the same day, Aaron filed a dispute on the claim based on "fair use"
* within a few hours, NBC Universal responded to the claim

===== Copyright claim on licensed work =====

=== Link Wrapping ===
YouTube links outbound links from posted content in <nowiki>www.youtube.com/redirect?q=</nowiki> URLs.
=== Unequal treatment of indie artists ===
* 2014-06-19 <cite>[http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/19/youtube-music-video-blocking/ YouTube won't block music videos from Indie labels, but it won't pay them either]</cite> <blockquote><p>[...] Labels who haven't signed up to the website's new terms, the majority of which are independents like XL Recordings, will have their artist channels blocked in the next few days.  ... labels who won't sign up to the paid tier are also kicked out of YouTube's ad-supported monetization scheme. So while we may still be able to find Lotus Flower on a Radiohead fan's channel, the band itself won't get a single penny.</p><p>[...] YouTube isn't even playing fair, offering "highly unfavorable and non-negotiable terms" which undercut the fees paid to Spotify, Rdio and Deezer, as well as being '''less generous than the money paid to the major labels like Warner, Sony and Universal.''' [...]</p></blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.

=== Lack of 3rd party copyright claim challenge ===
If you embed a YouTube video in one of your posts, and at some point in the future the video is taken down with just static in its place and "This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by ...", then there is no way for you as a 3rd party to evaluate and challenge the copyright claim.

Real world IndieWeb example(s):
* 2015-08-20 https://jeena.net/notes/423
** 2015-09-02 (13 days later) author noted that video was deleted

=== Requires Javascript ===
Videos do not play if javascript is disabled. No message or alternate player is shown on youtube.com. Embedded videos display a message "Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser."
