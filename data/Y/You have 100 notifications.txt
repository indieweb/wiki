{{stub}}

'''<dfn>You have 100 notifications</dfn>''' is the start of the subject of an email from [[Facebook]] congratulating you for not having interacted with Facebook for long enough that you  accrued 100 or more [[notifications]] in the mean time, and a thinly disguised desperate attempt to get you to use Facebook again.
