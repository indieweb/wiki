{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>block list</dfn>''' is a list of accounts that a user has [[block]]ed on a service or site.

== Why ==
You should keep a block list so you can automatically reject [[spam]] or otherwise abusive [[webmention]]s.

== How to ==
No one has implemented this so far, thus there is no recommended way to do so yet.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]], on your contacts list page (e.g. https://www.flickr.com/people/tantek/contacts/ - substitute your own username for "tantek") has a link with text "Your Block List" at the bottom left which links to:
* https://www.flickr.com/people/tantek/contacts/ignore/

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] allows apps that have OAuth read permissions on your account to view your blocklist per:
* https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/blocks/list
But has no UI on their website nor their apps to show you your blocklist.

== Brainstorm ==
