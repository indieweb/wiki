'''<dfn>[http://movabletype.com Movable Type]</dfn>''' is commercial blogging software written in Perl and originally released in 2001.

== Examples ==
Many, very active 10+ year old blogs use Movable Type, e.g.,

* http://dashes.com/anil/
* http://daringfireball.net/
* http://waxy.org/
* http://codinghorror.com - 2004[http://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-horror-movable-type-since-2004/] - 2014[http://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/]

This makes it an interesting case study for [[longevity]]. 

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
The above sites are all "independent" even "indieweb" by at least some [[IndieMark]] measure.

However, no one active in the indiewebcamp community currently uses Movable Type.

Would be great to get one or more the above examples involved in the community!

== Database and Static Files ==
<blockquote>Movable type is interesting in the database debate. It uses a database, but renders all pages to static files by default. So sites made with it tend to be less fragile and persist longer</blockquote>

== FAQ ==
=== Movable Type Outreach ===
Q: Do we have a moveable type outreach group? (Possible candidate? http://sixcolors.com/2014/12/powered-by-movable-type/ )

A: Not at the moment, as we don't even have any indieweb community members using Movable Type to do the outreaching (in contrast to the [[WordPress Outreach Club]]).
