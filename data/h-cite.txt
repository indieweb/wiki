{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-cite h-cite]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up citations and references on web sites.

== IndieWeb Uses ==
There are several indieweb uses of h-cite:
* [[reply-context]] - on the summary display of the original post that a reply/comment is in-reply-to
* [[comments]] - on comments shown below a post that have been federated/syndicated in from their original reply permalink
* blockquotes - when quoting other blog posts, it's good to provide a fully marked up citation using h-cite
* citation user interface - explicit <kbd>&lt;cite class="h-cite"&gt;</kbd> markup provided in an input text box at the bottom of blog posts for others to easily copy and paste into their follow up blog posts or responses.
** [[User:Tantek|Tantek]] provides such input boxes with citation markup to copy/paste in the footer of every [[article]] he publishes, e.g. [http://tantek.com/2013/287/b1/daily-routines-creatives-edited]

== FAQ ==
'''Q:''' When making a mentions stream, should I use h-cite around each entry?

'''A:''' If you are displaying the entire entry, then it does not need an h-cite. If you are citing a summary of the entry — e.g. name, URL, and dt-published — then an h-cite is appropriate.
