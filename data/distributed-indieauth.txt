'''<dfn>distributed indieauth</dfn>''' is a way of using [[indieauth]] authorization in a distributed manner across websites, including how to have your website explicitly delegate to an [[authorization-endpoint|authorization server]] (such as indieauth.com) or act as its own authorization server.

== Level 0: Enable web sign-in ==
Link your website with a [[rel=me]] link to a common OAuth provider such as Github or Twitter. Or you can put your email address or phone number on your site to use Persona or SMS-based authentication.

This will make login work with sites that implement [[RelMeAuth]] directly, and with sites that use an authorization API that supports RelMeAuth such as [[indieauth.com]].

== Level 1: Choose a public authorization server ==
Choose a hosted authorization server and link it from your homepage:

<pre>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth"&gt;</pre>

=== Public authorization servers ===
* [[indieauth.com]]: <pre>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth"&gt;</pre>

* [[indieauth-openid]]: <pre>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="http://indieauth.id.cweiske.de/"&gt;</pre>

* [[indiecert.net]]: <pre>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indiecert.net/auth"&gt;</pre>

== Level 2: Host your own authorization server ==
Find or create an authorization server and tell [[IndieAuth]] clients to use it when signing in.
The server has to implement the [[IndieAuthProtocol]].

=== Use an authorization service ===
Use an authorization service such as [[indieauth.com]] or [[indieauth-openid]].

Link to it from your homepage as follows:

<pre>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://myauthserver.example.org/auth"&gt;</pre>

=== Create your own authorization endpoint ===
* [[authorization-endpoint]]
* [[IndieAuthProtocol]]

== Level 3: Use other IndieWeb apps ==
In order to use IndieWeb apps such as [[OwnYourGram]] or [[Taproot]] to post to your own site, you effectively need to turn your site into an OAuth provider. 

=== Use a token endpoint service ===
Such as https://tokens.indieauth.com

=== Create your own token endpoint ===
* [[token-endpoint]]

=== Create your micropub endpoint ===
* [[micropub-endpoint]]
