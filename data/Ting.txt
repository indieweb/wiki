'''<dfn>[https://ting.com/ Ting]</dfn>''' is a mobile virtual network provider(MVNO) owned by TUCOWS, launched in February of 2012. Ting is characterized by a per-unit usage model where each device has a base cost plus tax. Minutes, texts, and data are offered in 4 bands, after which there is pure per-unit pricing([https://ting.com/rates Rates]).

Ting runs on [[Sprint]]'s [[CDMA]] network, with voice roaming on [[Verizon]]. It has announced that in February of 2015(subject to change), it will launch [[GSM]] offerings. While not revealed, these appear to be on T-Mobile's network.

In December of 2015, Ting announced([https://ting.com/blog/hey-remember-that-time-you-asked-us-to-fix-home-internet-access-too/ Blog Post]) it was getting into the home internet business by buying a majority stake in a small independent service provider in Charlottesville, Virginia with the goal of further expansions in other communities.
