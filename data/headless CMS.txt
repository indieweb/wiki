{{stub}}

'''<dfn>headless CMS</dfn>''' is a Content Management System that only handles the backend parts of a traditional CMS (storage, editing interface, APIs, ...), with the visitor-facing side handled by a different system. 

For an Indieweb site, a combination of file storage and a [[Micropub]] server that are used to create posts that are then rendered into a [[static site]] by a [[static site generator]] could be called a headless CMS.
