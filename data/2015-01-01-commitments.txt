** Completed 2014-12-20. I am running a service called [https://github.com/agschwender/pilbox/ Pilbox] that mirrors and resizes foreign content. It's running at <nowiki>https://kylewm.com/imageproxy</nowiki>, so the mirrored content is guaranteed to be behind https even if the original isn't. Images are cached by nginx to avoid hitting the third party sites for every request [https://kylewm.com/2014/12/mixed-content-warning-no-more-lock-icon-png-lock]

* {{GWG}}: http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-18#t1418962576242
** code cleanup: "Kinds can do everything I want instead of also having Post Formats"
** improved [[reply-context]] including author icon and [[reply-context#author_name|author name]]
** completed: majority of work in advance of 01-01, however, massive changes to Kinds(Indieweb post types) and the removal of WordPress Post Formats created some design issues. Working on redoing the site design to account for this as part of a new project.
