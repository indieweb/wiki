'''<dfn>beakermentions</dfn>''' is an application to read and send responses on what you're currently viewing on [[Beaker Browser]], specially designed to be run from an attached ''[https://docs.beakerbrowser.com/apis/beaker.panes/ pane]''.

== Beakermentions Endpoint ==

Beakermentions Endpoint is an endpoint implementation of the W3C [[Webmention]] recommendation for Beaker Browser users. This implementation utilizes Beaker Browser's [https://hypercore-protocol.org/#hyperdrive hyperdrive] and [https://docs.beakerbrowser.com/apis/beaker.peersockets/ peersockets] API. Deviations exist from the official recommendation due to the unique environment Beaker Browser provides:

* The source may reference the target URL of the Webmention through the file's metadata keys (like <code>@inReplyTo</code>, <code>@likeOf</code>, <code>@rsvpTo</code>, etc.) in addition to the file's content.

* The sender may look for a metadata key @webmention in the target's URL to discover the target's Beakermentions Endpoint in addition to the sender looking for an HTTP link header, a <link> element, or an <a> element with a @rel value of "webmention."

Communication between the users and the Beakermentions Endpoint are done through <code>Location</code> search strings and <code>beaker.peersockets</code> instead of a conventional HTTP POST request.

Mentions are not limited to HTML &mdash; any Dat file can mention any other file using metadata key-value pairs.

Do note that this is only an endpoint implementation; an endpoint only stores and provides the source URLs that mention a particular target URL. Any rendering of mentions (including which mentions to render) is done by an application itself after retrieving a target's sources.

==How This Works==

# Alice writes a new Dat file and saves it to <code>hyper://alice/microblog/a-good-day.md</code>.
# Alice adds a <code>@webmention</code> metadata key to the new Dat file to the URL of their Beakermentions endpoint (<code>hyper://alice-beakermentions/</code>, for example)
# Alice opens their Beakermentions endpoint so it's listening for new sent mentions, then minimizes it to the background.
# Bob sees Alice's new file and wants to tell Alice that they like it! They write a new file in response, add their own <code>@webmention</code> key in the metadata so others can respond to it, add a <code>@likeOf</code> key with a value of Alice's file URL, and saves their response to <code>hyper://bob/microblog/that-is-good.md</code>.
# Bob's application notices that the file they're saving mentions Alice's file. After saving, it offers to bring Bob to Alice's Beakermentions endpoint's page to automatically send the mention (<code>hyper://alice-beakermentions/?source=hyper://bob/microblog/that-is-good.md&target=hyper://alice/microblog/a-good-day.md&done=hyper://bob/</code>
## Alternatively, Bob may interactively send the webmention (instead of their application) by visiting Alice's Beakermention endpoint, entering their response as the source and Alice's file as the target, and pressing send.
# Alice's Beakermentions endpoint verifies that Alice wants their file mentioned by checking that their file's <code>@webmention</code> key is the Beakermention endpoint's URL, then checks Bob's file to make sure that they mention Alice's file URL in its metadata or in its content.
# After verification, Alice's Beakermentions endpoint stores the mention in <code>hyper://alice-beakermentions/mentions/hyper/alice/microblog/a-good-day.md.json</code>, then sends Bob a success message. At this point, the endpoint may send Bob back to <code>hyper://bob/</code>.

Now, when an application opens Alice's file, they may notice the <code>@webmention</code> key in the metadata. They may get all the stored mentions from the Beakermentions Endpoint by reading <code>hyper://alice-beakermentions/mentions/hyper/alice/microblog/a-good-day.md.json</code> and display whichever mentions they want to present by processing each URL.
