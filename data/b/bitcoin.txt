'''<dfn>bitcoin</dfn>''' is something that does not actually exist, what does exist is a 2-bits coin, AKA a quarter, worth 25¬¢.

=== Mining Wastes Electricity At Loss ===
__TOC__
Quotes from https://pthree.org/2016/01/30/bitcoin-mining-rate-and-waste/ tweeted:
<blockquote>"$609 spent on electricity per Bitcoin mined. Bitcoin is currently trading at $376/BTC" </blockquote>[https://twitter.com/BrianTRice/status/695062129431302144]

<blockquote>So, according to those numbers, unless using renewable energy, cheaper electricity, or Bitcoin trading goes north of $610 USB/BTC mining for Bitcoin is a net loss. This comes at the expense of 1.3 million pounds of CO2 released into the atmosphere every hour.</blockquote>[https://pthree.org/2016/01/30/bitcoin-mining-rate-and-waste/]

<blockquote>"I would argue that Bitcoin is the worst idea to come out of Computer Science in the history of mankind."</blockquote>[https://twitter.com/KuraFire/status/695056830158999552]

=== Digital Tulip ===
üå∑ Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are digital tulips at best, except you can actually plant tulip bulbs and get pretty flowers, and sometimes more bulbs!

* Thread: https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1462471938996064263
** "Worth adding, bitcoin is not a store of value, a hedge against inflation, nor does it provide diversification. It has no underlying, no income, and no statistically significant long term relationship to macroeconomic factors. It's simply a digital tulip.<br>https://twitter.com/jimstewartson/status/1462157679829291015" [http://www.stephendiehl.com @smdiehl] November 21, 2021
