Quotes from https://pthree.org/2016/01/30/bitcoin-mining-rate-and-waste/ tweeted:
<blockquote>"$609 spent on electricity per Bitcoin mined. Bitcoin is currently trading at $376/BTC" </blockquote>[https://twitter.com/BrianTRice/status/695062129431302144]

<blockquote>So, according to those numbers, unless using renewable energy, cheaper electricity, or Bitcoin trading goes north of $610 USB/BTC mining for Bitcoin is a net loss. This comes at the expense of 1.3 million pounds of CO2 released into the atmosphere every hour.</blockquote>[https://pthree.org/2016/01/30/bitcoin-mining-rate-and-waste/]
