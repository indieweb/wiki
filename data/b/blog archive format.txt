'''<dfn>blog archive format</dfn>''' is a data format proposed by {{manton}} for the [[export]] of a blog, based on a zip file and top level HTML [[h-feed]] inside, that is supported by [[micro.blog]]. Posts are saved as both h-feed and JSON Feed so that importers can choose which format they prefer to parse.

Original proposal: https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html

== Advantages ==

Blog Archive Format was designed to solve a few problems compared to other export formats:

* An open format that is not tied to implementations details of any single platform.
* Wrapped in a ZIP file so can contain images and other media.
* Includes both JSON Feed and Microformats for options when reading archives.
* Includes an HTML file of posts with relative image links so that it can be previewed directly in a web browser without any conversion.

== Implementations ==
=== micro.blog ===
[[Micro.blog]] can export and import as blog archive format:

* On the web, click on Posts → "…" → Export. Micro.blog will create a .bar file on S3 and make it available for download.
* In the macOS app, choose File → Export → Blog Archive. Micro.blog will download all your photos locally and save a .bar file to your Mac.
* For importing, in the macOS app choose File → Import → Blog Archive. You can also double-click on .bar files to open them.

=== Ruby script ===

A script for converting between Mastodon's export (essentially ActivityStreams 2.0 JSON) and Blog Archive Format can be run as a command-line tool, available as a GitHub Gist here: https://gist.github.com/manton/946ddbb74b5d0948053d7e23793ead77

== Uses ==
* [[Koype]] has a plan to implement the exporting of <code>.bar</code> files (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/29) and importing (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/31)
* [[micro.blog]] has [[2019/Austin/Demos#Manton_Reece|support since 2019]]
