'''<dfn>blog archive format</dfn>''' is a data format proposed by {{manton}} for the [[export]] of a blog, based on a zip file and top level HTML [[h-feed]] inside, that is supported by [[micro.blog]]. Posts are saved as both h-feed and JSON Feed so that importers can choose which format they prefer to parse.

Original proposal: https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html.

Micro.blog can export as blog archive format:

* On the web, click on Posts → "…" → Export. Micro.blog will create a .bar file on S3 and make it available for download.
* In the macOS app, choose File → Export → Blog Archive. Micro.blog will download all your photos locally and save a .bar file to your Mac.
