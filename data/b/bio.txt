A '''<dfn>bio</dfn>''' is a commonly occurring page or [[homepage]] section that provides a summary description about a person. Bio information can either be on a dedicated page or often on the site [[home page]].

== Guidelines ==
A good bio should be concise. This is not a [[resume]] (that's what [[h-resume]] is for). This is to introduce people to the author and owner of the site.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
