A '''<dfn>bio</dfn>''' is a commonly occurring page or [[homepage]] section that provides a summary description about a person. Bio information can either be on a dedicated page or often on the site [[home page]].

== Guidelines ==
A good bio should be concise. This is not a [[resume]] (that's what [[h-resume]] is for). This is to introduce people to the author and owner of the site.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== on homepage ===
==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has a very brief bio on his home page tantek.com since 2010-??-?? marked up with <code>p-note</code> inside his page h-card.
* and a separate longer bio on a wiki page: tantek.com/w/TantekBio

==== Aaron ====
{{aaronpk}} has a brief bio on his home page, and on the footer of every page, marked up with <code>p-note</code> inside his h-card.

==== Chris Coyier ====
[https://chriscoyier.net/ Chris Coyier] has a customizable bio on his homepage, ostensibly in part to make it easy for either himself or visitors to create a bio that suits their needs particularly if they're looking for text to put on another page or to use as an introduction for speaking engagements or other in-person introductions. The customizations provided by means of radio buttons include length (short, medium, long), style (1st person, 3rd person), and code (rendered, HTML, and Markdown).
