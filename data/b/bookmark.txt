[[Category:PostType]]
{{emojicon|ðŸ”–}}

A '''<dfn>bookmark</dfn>''' (or <dfn>linkblog</dfn>) is a [[post]] that is primarily comprised of a URL, often title text from that URL, sometimes optional text describing, [[tag]]ging, or quoting from its contents.

== Why ==
Bookmarks are useful for saving things to read later or build a recommended reading list. Post bookmarks on [[own your data|your own site]] instead for all the usual [[reasons]].

Here are some community members' reasons for posting bookmarks:

* I bookmark things usually as 'read later', 'will read again' or 'should reference in a paper'. - {{rhiaro}}
* I bookmark to build my library, and help build ours. I bookmark research articles, blog posts and other media and then use tags to make them easily sortable. I also syndicate bookmarks for my audience on social media channels who find the resources helpful. {{jgmac1106}}
* I bookmark as a way of sharing content for others (a recommended reading list of sorts), but also as a way to have a record for myself of interesting things I may want to come back to later {{jamietanna}}

== How ==
=== How to markup ===
To post a bookmark, the post's [[h-entry]] must have a property <code>u-bookmark-of</code> with the URL you are bookmarking.

For example, to bookmark <code><nowiki>https://someothersite.example.com/permalink47</nowiki></code>

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry"> ... 
 <a class="u-bookmark-of" href="https://someothersite.example.com/permalink47">...</a>
</div>
</nowiki></pre>

The trailing preposition "of" helps communicate this in the same way that we have <code>u-in-reply-to</code> instead of <code>u-reply</code>.

For bookmarks that contain both a link and a meaningful title, consider using <code>u-bookmark-of h-cite</code> instead:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
  <a class="u-bookmark-of h-cite" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-12-04-lts-to-ubuntu-14-04-lts">
    How to Upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
  </a>
</div></nowiki></pre>

__TOC__

=== How to display ===
(stub)

Displaying bookmark posts are challenging because the display should clearly show both the author of the bookmark (as its a bookmark post), and the author of the thing being bookmarked (as well as that thing)

There are at least three types of bookmark presentation to specifically design:
# '''[[permalink]]''' presentation of a bookmark post
# '''list''' presentation of multiple bookmark posts (e.g. on a post-type-specific [[archive]] page)
# '''composite''' list of bookmarks and other posts (e.g. on a [[homepage]]

(To be expanded with more advice / screenshots of existing approaches for each)

==== Showing Bookmarks vs Submissions ====
[[File:indienews-bookmark-posts.png]]

IndieNews is an aggregator where you can submit posts via Webmention. You can either submit your own posts by adding a u-syndication link from your post to IndieNews, or you can submit other posts by making a bookmark post on your site and submitting that.

For direct submissions, IndieNews displays the name of the post and the domain name of the site (see bottom post in screenshot).

For submissions of bookmarks, IndieNews displays the name and domain of the bookmarked post as if it were posted directly, and indicates that it was "submitted from" the domain of the person who submitted it. (see above post in screenshot).

=== How to POSSE ===
There are some emerging patterns for how people [[POSSE]] bookmark posts in particular.

==== POSSE to Twitter with Emoji ====
Similar to POSSEd post types like [[jam]] and [[read]] one could prepend POSSE posts to Twitter with an [[ðŸ”–]] [[emoji]] to indicate the post type. Rather than simply posting a title and a URL, the emoji could help to indicate that a bookmarked post hasn't (necessarily) been read by the poster. Emoji use on Twitter is particularly effective as the platform limits the number of characters to indicate sentiment. One can also take advantage of the concept of Twitter cards to shoehorn additional information from the post into the tweet (though this is only displayed on some twitter clients/outlets).

Examples:
* {{chrisaldrich}} POSSE to Twitter https://twitter.com/ChrisAldrich/status/768874827218169856
* Bookmark emoji appears in Twitter card rather than in main tweet, this allows additional sentiment to be placed in both the Tweet body as well as the Twitter card: https://twitter.com/ChrisAldrich/status/825206436305137664

==== POSSE to another Twitter ====
A number of individuals POSSE bookmarks explicitly to a different [[Twitter]] account than their "normal" or "primary" one.

Examples:
* {{adactio}} POSSEs from his site's bookmarks to https://twitter.com/adactiolinks
* ...

Related examples (bookmarking to another Twitter in general, might not be POSSEing)
* [https://twitter.com/nelson @nelson] posts bookmarks to https://twitter.com/somebitsLinks
* ...

==== Design of POSSE bookmark tweets ====
Alternative approaches exist regarding the content POSSEd to Twitter, mainly based on the intended audience and whether the post contains just the bookmark or broader commentary:

{{adactio}} provides short commentary in the post but has, based on feedback regarding unnecessary clicks, decided to share only the bookmarked URL on his Twitter feed:
* https://twitter.com/adactioLinks/status/779759088485953536

{{sgreger}} is testing various approaches that feature the URL of his own post, in order to always present the reader with his commentary:
* linking only to the bookmark post https://twitter.com/sebastiangreger/status/769068496261177344
* links to both the bookmarked website and the bookmark post, e.g. https://twitter.com/sebastiangreger/status/768770201135505408 (N.B. only the last URL in a Tweet is shown as a link preview on Twitter, see http://indieweb.org/twitter#Features)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] previously used [[WordPress]] to post bookmarks on [http://aaron.pk/bookmarks/ aaron.pk/bookmarks] using a custom Wordpress post type since 2010-12-18. He now uses [[Quill]] to post bookmarks to [[p3k]] as of 2014-09-07[https://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/09/07/1/indieweb-bookmarks]. 

These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Title/text
* Optional tags
* Optional snippet of text manually copied from the URL as a way to remember why I bookmarked it ([http://aaron.pk/bookmarks/?bookmark=hashcash example])
* Optional note about why I bookmarked it

Video showing browser bookmarklet from [[Quill]] used to post bookmarks: 
* http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/09/07/1/indieweb-bookmarks

=== Sebastian Greger ===
{{sgreger}} has posted bookmarks since 2014-06-12
* https://sebastiangreger.net/2014/06/bookmark-4354/

Bookmarks contain:
* nested [[h-cite]] for bookmark's name, photo, and URL
* date published
* name of bookmark post
* commentary

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} used [[Red Wind]] to post bookmarks on his site kylewm.com [https://kylewm.com/2014/07/meet-the-man-building-an-ai-that-mimics-our-neocortex-and-could-kill since 2014-07-08]. E.g.:
* https://kylewm.com/2014/07/meet-the-man-building-an-ai-that-mimics-our-neocortex-and-could-kill

Site no longer live.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] to post bookmarks on his site waterpigs.co.uk as [[notes]] tagged with "[http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/?tagged=bookmark bookmark]" since ????-??-??. These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Tags
* Text note with one or more URLs inline

=== Jeremy Keith ===
[[User:adactio.com|Jeremy Keith]] posts bookmarks on his own site at [http://adactio.com/links/ adactio.com/links] since ????-??-?? and [[POSSE]]s them to [https://delicious.com/adactio Delicious]. These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Title
* tags
* Description

He also displays webmentions received from bookmark posts: https://adactio.com/articles/9843#comment37529

=== Shane Becker ===
{{veganstraightedge}} imports bookmarks to [http://veganstraightedge.com/bookmarks veganstraightedge.com/bookmarks] by [[PESOS]]ing from [[Instapaper]] (tagged with "imported:from=instapaper.com") and [[Pinboard]] (tagged with "imported:from=pinboard.in") since ????-??-??. He sub-categorizes them by adding a "fave", "read-later", "watch-later" or "listen-later" tag to a bookmark post. The linked title of a bookmark post goes to the bookmarked URL, not the bookmark post's permalink. Bookmark posts have a '''â‡œ''' before the title to help indicate that the link goes to an external site. The '''â‡œ''' is applied using a CSS :before selector and a content property to keep it out of the actual HTML/microformat content. These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Title
* tags
* Excerpt (optional)
* Description (optional)

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} has been able to post bookmarks since 2014-10-10, with [[Postly]] though has not used it much yet other than as testing.
https://ben.thatmustbe.me/bookmark/2014/10/10/6/bookmark

=== atomicules ===
[[User:atomicules.co.uk]], taking a slightly different approach, I decided I did not want to host or own every bookmark I make as I would never have a self-hosted tool as quick and as convenient as Pinboard, etc, nor did I want the clutter of bookmarks offtopic to that of my website. I did, however, already have link type posts, so I decided to start syndicating these out to [[Pinboard]] (See that page for my example).

=== Larry Kooper ===
At [https://indieweb.org/2016/NYC2 IndieWebCamp 2016 NYC2], attendee Larry Kooper demoed a [http://marybeth.nyc/bookmarks/homepage.php bookmark site] he built. The [https://github.com/larrykooper/bookmarks code is available on Github].

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} uses a customized bookmarklet in combination with the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds] plugin for [[WordPress]]. Bookmarks contain:
* URL
* Title
* Date
* Optional author, name of source, tags & categories
* [[oEmbed]] of original page if available
* Ability to redirect the entire post to the original content using a canonical URL
I also have an optional workflow using [http://pressforward.org/ PressForward] that not only includes the above, but which can scrape the content of the page via the [[Mercury]] API to make an [[archival copy]] on my site if I wish. I also use [https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-archival/ Post Archival] to [https://indieweb.org/Internet_Archive#Trigger_an_Archive trigger an archival copy to the Internet Archive] as well. [[POSSE]] copies are often sent to [[Twitter]], usually with a bookmark emoji as described above and other optional services like Mendeley, diigo, delicious, scoop.it, flipboard, stubleupon, and others as appropriate.

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} posts bookmarks as of 2016-11-20, showing the text 'Seb heeft [title] door [author] gebookmarkt.' with a bookmark-icon. No quotes. Similar as a like (with a heart icon), but for more serious articles, meaning 'interesting' or 'please also read this' and in some cases 'want to read' or 'want to read again later'.
* I realised (on 2017-08-06) that I bookmarked something twice. They ment more "I want to read this" than "please read this too". Thinking about changing how I use them, more into an archive of interesting articles, with categories and notes, to revisit and actually add value to the post.
* <cite>"I subscribed to my own bookmarks feed in my reader, back when I used a reader. That was the purpose: to be able to revisit interesting articles.</cite> [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-08-06#t1502045319051000]

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} uses [[Quill]] to post bookmarks as of 2017-04-25 ([https://martymcgui.re/2017/04/25/105934/ example]). Bookmarks contain:
* URL
* Title
* Date
* Tags
* Optional blockquote snippet copied from the original text

=== Jamie Tanna ===
{{jamietanna}} uses [[Hugo]] to post bookmarks as of [https://www.jvt.me/notes/6b919e78-c46a-48e3-8866-9d9e9d41bb3d/ 2019-05-06]. Bookmarks contain:

* URL
* Date
* Tags
* Commentary (optional)

Jamie's approach is to use bookmarks as a means to share interesting posts with him in the future or others reading the blog.

== Tools ==
=== Monocle ===
[[Monocle]] consumes bookmark posts.

=== IndieNews ===
[[IndieNews]] consumes bookmark posts.

=== Indieweb.xyz ===
[[Indieweb.xyz]] consumes bookmark posts.

== Additional Indieweb Discussion ==
* [[2016/Brighton/indiebookmarks]] Bookmark Workflow was a session at IndieWebCamp Brighton 2016.
* [[2017/Berlin/bookmarks]] Bookmarks & Archiving was a session at IndieWebCamp Berlin 2017.

== Self-hostable Services ==
* [[Shaarli]]
* [[Wallabag]], while technically more of a [[read later]] type of service, it could be bent to be used as a self-hosted bookmarklet service.
** {{jamietanna}} used to use it for both purposes - read-it-later, but favourite posts that I wanted to come back to

== Silos ==

Bookmark hosting silos

=== Tagging focused silos  ===

==== Delicious ====

[[Delicious]], now defunct, was launched in 2003 and was among the first to implement tags, and user-tagging (AKA folksonomy), and present a UI of popular tags.

==== Magnolia ====

[[Magnolia]], now defunct, was one of the larger competitors to [[Delicious]], but closed down shortly after they lost all their users data in an outage in 2009.

==== Pinboard ====

[[Pinboard]] is a paid bookmarking silo launched in 2009. Got lots of users from [[Delicious]] after the latter announced its supposed shutdown in 2010.

The below image is of the bookmark display on Pinboard, which adopts a text-first somewhat minimalist design which shows the name, when it was bookmarked, and by whom. A description and tags can be optionally added. [[File:Pinboard.png]]

Supports both public and private bookmarks.

In late 2016 BjÃ¶rn Stierand created a [https://github.com/egoexpress/known-pinboard Known plugin for syndicating bookmarks to Pinboard]

==== Wakelet ====
[https://wakelet.com/ Wakelet] is a bookmarking [[silo]] service focused on [[collection|collecting]], curating, and sharing online content.

=== Read it later focused silos ===

==== Instapaper ====

[[Instapaper]] was created by [https://marco.org/ Marco Arment] in 2008, sold to betaworks in 2013, got ([http://www.wired.com/2016/08/pinterest-buys-instapaper/ bought by Pinterest]) in 2016, then [https://blog.instapaper.com/post/175953870856 became independent again in 2018].

==== Pocket ====

[[Pocket]] is now owned by [[Mozilla]] has integration with Mozilla's [[Firefox]] browser. In version 57, a Pocket-icon appears in the address-bar. When clicked upon, it shows a little popup with 'Saving...' and then 'Saved to Pocket', with links to remove the bookmark or view the list. It is also possible to add comma separated tags to the bookmark.

[[File:2017-10-09-firefox-pocket-bookmark-ui.jpg|300px]]

The reading list 'My List' contains all your bookmarked pages. When you hover over an item, it gives you options to share, archive, delete, re-tag, or favorite the item. Clicking the check-mark archives the item and removes it from the list and adds it to archive, so you can keep track of what you have read and what you haven't.

Pocket removes double entries: if you save a page twice (by accident?) it won't save it twice on your list. If you marked it as read, however, it will appear as unread in your reading list.

[[File:2017-10-09-pocket-reading-list.jpg]]

=== Sharing and social focused silos ===

==== Pinterest ====

[[Pinterest]] is a visual bookmark hosting silo where users "pin" (bookmark), or "repin" (repost a bookmark of) a page with a specific image from that page to a "pinboard" (named bookmark collection) and follow other users and/or pinboards created by others.

Bought [[Instapaper]] in 2016, which later bought itself back to independence in 2018.

==== Pownce ====

[[Pownce]] enabled posting of a couple of different types of content to ones profile, one of which was links. It remains [https://blog.leahculver.com/2008/05/announcing-oembed-an-open-standard-for-embedded-content.html famous as the creator] of [[oEmbed]].

==== Tumblr ====

[[Tumblr]] enables posting of a couple of different types of content to ones profile, one of which is links.

=== Academic/Research Related bookmarking silos ===

The following silo services, often with other social features built in, are often used by those in academia to bookmark research papers and journal articles:
* [http://www.mendeley.com Mendeley]
* [http://www.citeulike.org/ Citeulike] - [http://www.citeulike.org/news shutting down on 2019-03-30]
* [http://www.bibsonomy.org/ Bibsonomy]
* [http://sciencewise.info/bookmarks/ Sciencewise]

=== Other bookmarking silos ===

* [[diigo]]
* [http://www.stumbleupon.com/ StumbleUpon]
* [[Reading.am]] - for [[reading]] related bookmarks
* [[Twitter]] - added private bookmark functionality to the app in February 2018 and to the website later that year.

== Similar Post Kinds ==
Text of a '''bookmark post''' is most often the title of the linked resource, i.e. created by the author of the linked resource, rather than the person posting the bookmark post.

This is a key distinction between a bookmark and other kinds of posts.

=== Reply ===
The text of a ''[[reply]]'' is written by the person posting the reply, and often a new statement in response to the original post.

If the text of a bookmark post is written as commentary on the bookmark, then that should likely be a reply post instead.

=== Repost ===
The text of a [[repost]] comes from the entirety of the <em>content</em> of a bookmark rather than the name or title of the bookmarked resource.

If the text of a bookmark post is the entirety of the contents of the thing that is bookmarked, then that should likely be a repost instead.

=== Quotation ===
The text of a [[quotation]] comes from part of the <em>content</em> of a bookmark rather than the name or title of the bookmarked resource.

If the text of a bookmark post is merely part of the contents of the thing that is bookmarked, then that should likely be a quotation instead.

=== Likes ===
There is a relatively strong semantic difference between a [[like]] and a [[bookmark]], but as a result of the inflexibility of many [[silos]] which support likes and do not have explicit bookmark functionality, the definition of a like can sometimes morph so that people in the wild will treat likes as bookmarks instead. Services like [[IFTTT]] can also reinforce these patterns via API by taking like/favorite inputs and easily converting them to bookmarks on services like [[Pocket]] and [[Instapaper]] (or even one's own website).

==== Examples ====
===== Twitter =====
On [[Twitter]] many people often use the [[like]] (or previously [[favorite]]) functionality (or sometimes even [[retweet|repost]]) to indicate a bookmark. 
* <blockquote>"likes" don't always mean support aka ðŸ”– -- [https://twitter.com/ohhelloana Ana R] Twitter bio on 2018-05-07</blockquote>
* <blockquote>"Wish Twitter would distinguish between "favorite" and "save for later."  People could infer some pretty misleading things..." -- [https://twitter.com/deandad/status/364910674557677568  Matt Reed (@deandad)] 5:47 PM - 6 Aug 2013</blockquote>
* <blockquote> "One of the things I do a lot on Twitter, for example, is retweet stories that I find interesting in order to come back to them later." - Cathie LeBlanc in [http://cathieleblanc.com/blog/design-of-my-website/ Design of My Site on 2018-06-07]<blockquote>

Twitter ultimately launched a bookmark feature (primarily within their mobile interface): [https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/twitter-launches-bookmarks-a-private-way-to-save-tweets/ Twitter launches Bookmarks, a private way to save tweets] on TechCrunch 2018-02-18; Includes some discussion about confusion and misinterpretation

===== Observable =====
The notebook service [https://beta.observablehq.com/ Observable] conflates their like and bookmark functionality:
* <blockquote>"Like a notebook? Let the author know by clicking the like button  in the top-right corner of the page! Liking a notebook also helps you find it again quickly by browsing your likes. In the future, weâ€™ll use likes to help you find interesting and delightful notebooks.</blockquote> -- [https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/changelog-2018-05-07 Observable Notebook] on 2018-05-07

===== Micro.blog =====
[[Micro.blog]] specifically goes out of its way to not promote a culture of collecting or displaying [[likes]] or [[favorites]] but conflates the idea of bookmarks with private favorites. When favoriting a post on micro.blog it is saved as a private bookmark [https://micro.blog/favorites within one's account] and doesn't display on or send any notifications to the original post. See also: https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-07-20#t1532115686980500
<blockquote>The nice thing about that is that if we ever officially rename "Favorite" to "Bookmark" in the M.b UI, other clients will automatically update as well.</blockquote>
