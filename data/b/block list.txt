{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>block list</dfn>''' is a list of accounts that a user has [[block]]ed on a service or site.

== Why ==
You should keep a block list so you can automatically reject [[spam]] or otherwise abusive [[webmention]]s.

== How to ==
[[dobrado]] checks a block list when receiving webmentions. It currently confirms with the sender that the webmention was received, but then discards the mention and logs the request as coming from a blocked domain. (It may be more appropriate to tell the sender that they have been blocked?)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{mblaney}} can add domains to a block list on his site:

== Silo Examples ==
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]], on your contacts list page (e.g. https://www.flickr.com/people/tantek/contacts/ - substitute your own username for "tantek") has a link with text "Your Block List" at the bottom left which links to:
* https://www.flickr.com/people/tantek/contacts/ignore/

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] shows the accounts you've blocked under settings:
* https://twitter.com/settings/blocked

Apps with OAuth read permissions on your account can also fetch your blocklist per:

* Check https://twitter.com/unblock_list/following for accounts to unblock, follow @unblock_list, and tweet “what blocklists” at the account and it will list any public block lists that you’re on.
* Example of shared blocklist: https://blocktogether.org/ and criticism, it can and has been (unintentionally?) abused by those with more power (privilege? e.g. celebrity status) to [[block]] those with much less power across a wide swath of “subscribers” to those shared block lists.

* criticism of shared blocklists: they can cause damage (disconnecting networks, instances) rapidly, with little recourse and much burden placed upon those added to lists: https://mastodon.social/@irenes/111059965974863510
** "@aphyr we've been publicly expressing concern about shared blocklists for, wow, almost ten years now. we agree in principle that sharing moderation decisions in some form is important, but it's incredibly risky because of how fast the damage happens and how little recourse there is" [https://mastodon.social/@irenes @irenes] September 13, 2023
