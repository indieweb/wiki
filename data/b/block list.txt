A '''<dfn>block list</dfn>''' is a list of accounts that a user has [[block]]ed on a service or site.

== Why ==
You should keep a block list so you can automatically reject [[spam]] or otherwise abusive [[webmention]]s.

== How to ==
[[dobrado]] checks a block list when receiving webmentions. It currently confirms with the sender that the webmention was received, but then discards the mention and logs the request as coming from a blocked domain. (It may be more appropriate to tell the sender that they have been blocked?)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{mblaney}} can add domains to a block list on his site:

== Silo Examples ==
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]], on your contacts list page (e.g. https://www.flickr.com/people/tantek/contacts/ - substitute your own username for "tantek") has a link with text "Your Block List" at the bottom left which links to:
* https://www.flickr.com/people/tantek/contacts/ignore/

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] shows the accounts you've blocked under settings:
* https://twitter.com/settings/blocked

Apps with OAuth read permissions on your account can also fetch your blocklist per:
