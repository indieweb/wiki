{{stub}}
A '''<dfn>backchannel</dfn>''' is a place for conversation that is off-topic, or for a community to communicate safely and privately. The latter can be very important for marginalized groups.

IndieWebCamp has a backchannel for off-topic conversation at [[indieweb-random|#indieweb-random]]. This chat is not logged, but it is still public.
