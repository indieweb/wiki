A '''<dfn>book</dfn>''' is a written work typically longer than an [[article]], on the indieweb, there are examples of publishing whole books on IndieWeb sites, as well as [[collection]]s of their [[personal library]] of books both physical and electronic.

For people publishing lists of books they've [[bookmark]]ed, want to [[read]], have [[acquisition|acquired]], or [[collections]] of digital or physical books in their [[personal library]] please see those pages for examples and details.

__TOC__
In 2009, Kathleen Fitzpatrick released [http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/plannedobsolescence/ Planned Obsolescence] in draft form for open peer review in fall 2009 (she was an editor on the site). It was later [https://amzn.to/2NAfIPF published in physical form by NYU Press] in 2011, but the original with [[annotation|annotations]] is still available online. The book was built on [https://wordpress.org/plugins/commentpress-core/ CommentPress] for [[WordPress]].

Beginning in 2016 she followed roughly the same process again for her book Generous Thinking by inviting an initial group of 40 people to comment online as she wrote, and then later opened it up to a wider audience. The online copy can be found at https://generousthinking.hcommons.org/. The [https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/generous-thinking physical book] was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in February 2019.

== Brainstorming ==
Brainstorming session to get an overview of some of the process, workflow, and current tools

A few people have books of either their own or those of others available online. Some may even be building [[OER]] (open educational resource) systems for distributing books related to teaching.
What is the best way to own them, display them, use them on one's own site? 
Let's discuss examples, UI, tools, methods, and related tidbits to flesh out the /book page on the wiki to jumpstart additional research and work into the area.

=== Goals ===
There are a variety of goals one may have with relation to books and the IndieWeb:
* Authors writing/editing books
* Authors publishing books
* Authors marketing books
* Authors selling books (see ecommerce / [[IndieWeb for business]])
* Displaying collections of owned books in one's personal library

Some of these portions of a books' early life overlap dramatically and some tools are evolving that subsume all of these pieces of work in one platform.

Big problem (particularly for self-publishing authors): writing and distributing books in a [[DRY]] (don't repeat yourself) way from start to finish
* It would be nice to do all of these pieces on a single website in a simple way

=== Writing/editing ===
Software and tools for writing and editing of texts and materials for books
* [[Github]] - multiple users and version control
* [https://www.overleaf.com/ Overleaf] - an online LaTeX editor
** some features require a paid account
* [https://quip.com/ Quip]
* Google Docs 
** Example of Open Pedagogy book: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4bnEbX-nqloNUxoa0pGdnczR0U?usp=sharing
** comments
** tasks
** revision history
* [https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview Scrivener]
** does epub, mobi, 
* [[wiki|Wikis]]
** [[MediaWiki]] - potential issue of plugins
** Allows multiple users writing/editing different sections simultaneously
* [[Calibre]] - like the iTunes of books for document management
** Will do file conversion from one format to another reasonably well
* [https://sigil-ebook.com/ Sigil] - for ebook epub document editing
* [https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence Confluence] (from Atlassian the owners of Jira, Bitbucket, etc.)
* [https://pandoc.org/ Pandoc]- convert between document formats
* MediaCommons.org
* [https://pressbooks.com/pressbooks-open-source-plugin/ Pressbooks] - built on multi-site WordPress installation
** Pressbooks is a GPL-licensed plugin that transforms a WordPress Multi-Site install into a book production Content Management System, which exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready PDF*, and various XML flavours.

==== What we're looking for in an [[editor]] generally ====
* editing
* collaborating
* spell check
* grammar check
* backup
* [[accessibility]]

General advice
* Don't edit in your [[CMS]] so you don't accidentally loose work or it doesn't get backed up

=== Book writing communities ===
* [https://www.nanowrimo.org/ NaNoWriMo]

=== Publishing ===
Books can be published in physical or digital formats. Even for physical books, one almost always begins with digital versions of texts to send to print shops for manufacturing.

Many editing software (see above) can be used to create digital outputs (.epub, .mobi, .pdf, etc.) which can then be distributed via digital means on one's own website or via a variety of [[silo]] methods (see below).

=== Publicity/ Marketing ===
[[author platform|Author platforms]] - general term for author websites for promoting their books and writing
* Most publishers want/require authors to have them for publicity
* IndieWeb could be an excellent way to build such sites, particularly for cross-platform conversations especially with [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]]
** Fewer places to check and maintain
** Makes posting and maintaining content a lot more [[DRY]]

=== IndieWeb examples ===
* {{addyourself}}

=== Silo Examples ===
* [[LibraryThing]]
* [[Goodreads]]

==== Advance Reader Copies / Advance Reader Editions ====

=== Distribution ===
Selling books often involves [[business|e-commerce]]
 
==== IndieWeb tools, methods, and examples ====

** has payment gateways like [[Stripe]], [[PayPal]], etc.
** [https://www.invoiceninja.com/ Invoice Ninja]

* [http://www.danah.org/ danah boyd] has pdfs on her website which are downloadable for free

* how does [https://craphound.com/ Corey Doctorow] distribute books on his site?
** He gives the product away and has indicated in the past that this actually helps with discovery as well as to drive longer term sales.
** He'd definitely against [[DRM]].

* [[Patreon]] model of writing and using a subscription model of $x per month as the book is written
** [https://dougbelshaw.com/ Doug Belshaw] is apparently using this sort of model
