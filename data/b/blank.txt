{{stub}}

'''<dfn>blank</dfn>''' may be short for <dfn>blank [[space]]</dfn>, or a top level page on a personal site that is intentionally left blank, or may refer to the [[#target_blank|<code>_blank</code> value of the HTML target attribute]], or a [[#about_blank|particular <code>about:</code> URL]], or the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:blank proposed CSS pseudoclass].

== Other uses ==
=== about blank ===
{{main|Wikipedia:about:blank}}
<code>about:blank</code> is a special url in many browsers to designate an empty page. 

The original [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/frameset framesets] and later, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe iframes] could be initialized with an actual "blank" page to avoid whatever browser defaults occurred when creating a frame with no value for <code>src</code>. 

=== target blank ===
Additionally, the <code>target</code> attribute on [[link|links]] can take the value <code>_blank</code> to load in a new window, though this has [[accessibility]] implications worth considering.
