== History ==

<code>about:blank</code> is a special url in many browsers to designate an empty page. 

The original [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/frameset framesets] and later, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe iframes] could be initialized with an actual "blank" page to avoid whatever browser defaults occurred when creating a frame with no value for <code>src</code>. 

Additionally, the <code>target</code> attribute on [[link|links]] can take the value <code>_blank</code> to load in a new window, though this has [[accessibility]] implications worth considering.
