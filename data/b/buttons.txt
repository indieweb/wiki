* {{aaronpk}} linked some IWC, Webmentions, Microfomats, and other small [[buttons]]/[[badges]] at https://aaronparecki.com/2017/12/30/7/indieweb-badge 
* Suggestion: add style="image-rendering:pixelated;" to the img tag for small badges when viewed on high-resolution displays. They will retain their pixelated look instead of made blurry when scaled up.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Webmentions Accepted ===
Idea: an <span style="display:inline-block;box-sizing:border-box;height:31px;border:1px solid black;background:#fd7;padding:0.3em 0.5em 0.5em;font-weight:bold">I ❤️ Webmentions</span> or <span style="display:inline-block;box-sizing:border-box;height:31px;border:1px solid black;background:#fd7;padding:0.3em 0.5em 0.5em;font-weight:bold">Webmentions accepted ✅</span> button to indicate your site accepts webmentions.

Link the button to your webmention endpoint with a query param of the page its on as the default target.

Have your webmention endpoint present a form UI to submit a webmention with the target auto-filled in with the default target from abovementioned link.

Use-case: [[Webmention-faq#How_do_you_know_if_a_website_uses_webmentions.3F]]
