'''<dfn>Buttons</dfn>''' are badges, logos, and banners that you can use to link to indieweb.org and related sites & technologies, and similar images for a handful of sites similarly aligned in [[principles]] or development approaches.

== Logos ==

* <img src="https://notbyai.fyi/img/written-by-human-not-by-ai-white.svg" width="88" /> for https://notbyai.fyi/ for badges/buttons for proclaiming that none of your website was generated by AI (perhaps suitable for a [[generative AI]] or [[LLM]] page).

== Brainstorming ==
=== Webmentions Accepted ===
Idea: an <span style="display:inline-block;box-sizing:border-box;height:31px;border:1px solid black;background:#fd7;padding:0.3em 0.5em 0.5em;font-weight:bold">I ❤️ Webmentions</span> or <span style="display:inline-block;box-sizing:border-box;height:31px;border:1px solid black;background:#fd7;padding:0.3em 0.5em 0.5em;font-weight:bold">Webmentions accepted ✅</span> button to indicate your site accepts webmentions.

Link the button to your webmention endpoint with a query param of the page its on as the default target.

Have your webmention endpoint present a form UI to submit a webmention with the target auto-filled in with the default target from abovementioned link.

Use-case: [[Webmention-faq#How_do_you_know_if_a_website_uses_webmentions.3F]]

=== Indiewebified ===
For some old school web [[fun]], if your site passes the tests at [[Indiewebify.me]], one could add a button to their site with a link to Indiewebify.me and/or to the link indicating that their site passed. (Contextual note: many of these old buttons were originally used to indicate that a site used certain specifications or passed certain validation tests.)

[[File:indiewebified.png|alt=80x15 button with an orange box containing a + sign on the left and the pixelated word INDIEWEBIFIED on the right.]]

=== Rendering on high resolution displays ===
Suggestion: add style="image-rendering:pixelated;" to the img tag for small badges when viewed on high-resolution displays. They will retain their pixelated look instead of made blurry when scaled up.

== Previously ==
=== Need to be updated ===
'''These need to be updated to the new logo.'''
