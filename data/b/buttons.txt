* {{aaronpk}} linked some IWC, Webmentions, Microfomats, and other small [[buttons]]/[[badges]] at https://aaronparecki.com/2017/12/30/7/indieweb-badge 
* Suggestion: add style="image-rendering:pixelated;" to the img tag for small badges when viewed on high-resolution displays. They will retain their pixelated look instead of made blurry when scaled up.
