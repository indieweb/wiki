A '''<dfn>bucketlist</dfn>''' is a [[page]] or [[collection]] of [[events]], activities, or life goals one wants to do, typically before dying (or idiomatically [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_the_bucket kicking the bucket]).

== Difference between bucketlist and wishlist ==
[[wish|Wishlists]] are seen more often in context of things or "stuff" one [[want]]s (esp. for birthdays, weddings, holidays, etc.) while bucketlists are often events, activities, life goals one wants to do or achieve. 

There is some structural overlap across what they are and how they present (especially if one were building a page for them), but the scope of things one would put on each, and plan for each is quite different in practice. That said see also [[want]] and [[wish]] for ideas on how one might structure these posts.

=== Framing of the name ===
<blockquote>I dislike the framing of bucket list. But maybe because I have no desire to kick the bucket, and having a long list would just make me anxious. &mdash; {{jeremycherfas}} via [https://chat.indieweb.org/2021-04-07#t1617827143483000 chat]</blockquote>
