{{stub}}

There are numerous <dfn>historical building blocks</dfn> which are no longer necessary (and in many cases, not even supported) on the indieweb. They are listed here both as history, and to clearly communicate that each has been considered, and either rejected (e.g. Salmon), or iterated/improved upon (e.g. Pingback became Webmention).

* See '''[[building-blocks]]''' for current building blocks to use and implement!

== Historical Mentions ==
Mention technologies:
* [[pingback]] & [[trackback]] - origins of [[webmention]] (which is also the replacement)
* [[salmon]] - was too complex/difficult for any more than a couple of implementations, unclear how much if any cross-implementation interoperability there ever was.

== Historical Logins ==
* [[OpenID]] - too difficult to consume. overly complex libraries often larger than the entirety of the rest of an indieweb implementation. too high a barrier for independent implementations.[http://tantek.com/2010/032/t4/huge-complex-openid-php-libraries] 
** Historical significance:
*** OpenID was the first even remotely practical federated URL-based identity protocol that gained adoption, and thus it helped explore a lot of URL-based-identity issues (UX and otherwise). Much of that experience informed the design of [[web-sign-in]].
*** OpenID was the URL-based-sign-in system used for this wiki and IndieWebCamp in [[2011]].[http://tantek.com/2011/047/t1/indiewebcamp-with-openid-seriously-best-web-id]
** Replacement: [[web-sign-in]] / [[indieauth]], which have demonstrated better usability than OpenID[http://tantek.com/2012/182/t4/relmeauth-victory-indiewebcamp-beats-openid-usability].
