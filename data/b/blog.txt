A '''<dfn>blog</dfn>''' (or <dfn>weblog</dfn>) is an online journal or diary typically written by one person (there are some group blogs) about whatever subjects they wish (like science or politics), usually on its own domain, often a personal IndieWeb site; blog or [[blogging]] is also the act of posting to a blog.

== Why ==
There are many reasons to start and regularly post a personal or perhaps semi-professional blog.

Keeping a blog of things you are learning and have learned is a commonly touted thing of interest to prospective employers as well as a chance to demonstrate some the skills you have and acquire.

Blogging about what you learn as you learn also demonstrates curiosity, self-motivation, and an interest in actively learning & growing new skills, all of which are strong positives for creatives of all types.

Originally blogs often consisted of a series of links with maybe some commentary / summary, or journal entries without explicit titles or names. See:
* '''[[bookmark#IndieWeb_Examples|IndieWeb Examples of bookmarks and linkblogging]]'''
* '''[[note#IndieWeb_Examples|IndieWeb Examples of notes and journaling]]''' for folks that blog their own notes, like tweets but without a length limit

A: Blogs Are Great.] <blockquote>This is my occasional request that if you (1) have a focused interest and (2) post regularly about it on social media, then please start a blog. Please read both points again before proceeding. And, no, I‚Äôm not saying cease social media. I‚Äôm saying your thoughts deserve their own plot of virtual land.</blockquote>

* Why blog on your personal site: get cited in news articles e.g. https://news.google.com/search?q=%22on+her+blog%22+OR+%22on+their+blog%22+OR+%22on+his+blog%22

But no matter what you create ‚Äî or why you create it ‚Äî own what you create by putting it on your domain. It‚Äôs time to be heard. It‚Äôs time to stop compromising. It‚Äôs time to own your online presence."</blockquote>
