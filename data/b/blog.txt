{{stub}}
A '''<dfn>blog</dfn>''' (or <dfn>weblog</dfn>) is an online journal or diary typically written by one person (there are some group blogs) about whatever subjects they wish, sometimes on a particular subject such as a science blog or political blog, and often on its own domain in a very much IndieWeb way, though the term long predates the community.

== Why ==
There are many reasons to start and regularly post a personal or perhaps semi-professional blog.

Keeping a blog of things you are learning and have learned is a commonly touted thing of interest to prospective employers as well as a chance to demonstrate some the skills you have and acquire.

Blogging about what you learn as you learn also demonstrates curiosity, self-motivation, and an interest in actively learning & growing new skills, all of which are strong positives for creatives of all types.
