A '''<dfn>blog</dfn>''' (or <dfn>weblog</dfn>) is an online journal or diary typically written by one person (there are some group blogs) about whatever subjects they wish, sometimes on a particular subject such as a science blog or political blog, and often on its own domain in a very much IndieWeb way, though the term long predates the community.
