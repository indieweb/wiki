'''<dfn>[https://bandsintown bandsintown]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] for [[musician]]s to promote their tours and for fans to track them.

== Criticism ==
At one point [when?], their ticket links on mobile would open the app or prompt you to install the app if you didn't have it. As of at least 2018-03-23, links on mobile work but they still encourage you to get the app. An overlay prompts you to "get our app to pick the best seats in the house" with links to "get app" or "continue". The "continue" button takes you to the requested page.
