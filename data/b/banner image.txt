__TOC__

'''<dfn>banner image</dfn>''' is a wide image, typically in an aspect ratio of 2:1 to 4:1, displayed as a backdrop at the top of a profile page or post permalink.

== Why ==
Banner images are useful for giving a home page a recognizable look.

Topical banner images can be used to give a summary or an evocative context for a blog post on a specific topic.

== How to ==
There is currently no agreed upon way of marking up banner images in general, e.g. on a home page.

A banner image for a post could be marked up as a [[u-featured]] image, however, there are no known examples of doing so.
