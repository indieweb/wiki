A '''<dfn>banner image</dfn>''' is a wide image (AKA <dfn>header image</dfn> or <dfn>hero image</dfn>), typically in an aspect ratio of 2:1 to 4:1, displayed as a backdrop at the top of a profile page or post permalink.

== Why ==
Banner images help give a [[home page]] a distinctive, recognizable look, and can also provide a text overlay of the [[tagline]] of a site or page.

Topical banner images can be used to give a summary or an evocative context for a blog post on a specific topic.
__TOC__
== How to ==
Embed a banner image near or at the top of a page, optionally stretching it using [[CSS]] to fill the full width of the page. 

If your banner image has text, please make sure you mark it up [[alt text]] for that text at a minimum, and regardless, consider a brief textual description of the image as well.

=== How to markup ===
‚ö†Ô∏è There is currently no agreed upon way of marking up banner images in general, aside from a strong encouragement to provide [[alt text]].

ü§î A banner image for a post could be marked up as a [[u-featured]] image, however, there are no known examples of doing so.

‚õîÔ∏è DO NOT mark up as a <code>u-photo</code>, because a banner image is decorative content, NOT primary content, unless you are literally posting about the banner image itself (or multiple.
