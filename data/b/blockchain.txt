'''<dfn>blockchain</dfn>''' is a technology in search of a problem to solve, pushed by ideology into areas where the unsolved problems aren’t technological. ([https://twitter.com/SimonSapin/status/890671156096753664 via @SimonSapin] quoting [http://blog.dshr.org/2017/07/decentralizedt-long-term-preservation.html Decentralized Long-Term Preservation])

A more idealistic description, [https://snarfed.org/2016-06-11_decentralized-web-summit#blockchain paraphrased from ''Decentralized Web Summit'']: <blockquote>… [blockchain is] the first ''open membership'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science) consensus algorithm] [i.e. that anyone can participate in] ever invented.</blockquote>

"anyone can" certainly seems conceptually (theoretically) true, and even practically true upon first deployment of such (eco)systems, however any such system with sufficient uptake seems to make "anyone can" aspect much less true in practice. e.g.

* [[namecoin#Issues]] - one person controls 75% namecoin compute power
