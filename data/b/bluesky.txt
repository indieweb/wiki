** "It is worth noting that this is the second hand wavy proposal Dorsey has come up with in the space of 12 months.

* Criticism & thread: https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1204791506143457281
** "Jack is many things, but an idiot he is not. He's whip smart. He knows we exist, he literally follows us. <br><br>This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android." [https://joinmastodon.org @joinmastodon] December 11, 2019
