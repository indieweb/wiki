A '''<dfn>bicycle</dfn>''' is a means of [[travel]] and or typically (also) an [[exercise]] post since it usually requires manual effort (instead of a fully powered electric bicycle).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has been posting bicycle "ride" posts for quite some time (since YYYY-MM-DD):
* https://aaronparecki.com/rides

__TOC__
== Silo Examples ==
=== Strava ===
[[Strava]] is used by a lot of folks to track their bicycling, and Strava calls individual bicycle ride posts "activities". This is convenient for many folks due to integration of many [[smart watch]]es with Strava to automatically upload bicycle ride activities.
* {{t}} tracks occasional bicycle rides on his Strava, and would like to [[PESOS]] them to his site.
