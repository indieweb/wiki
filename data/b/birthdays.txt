'''<dfn>birthdays</dfn>''' is a feature on some social media [[silos]] that shows a summary view of others birthdays for today, recently, or soon, sometimes with how old they are, and UI to interact with them, sometimes with a daily notification of whose / how many people's [[birthday]] it is. 

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
* https://www.facebook.com/events/birthdays/ (needs screenshot).
** page of people with current birthdays (today, recently, or soon)

* Notification: <blockquote>Name-of-person and 3 others have birthdays today. Send them good thoughts!</blockquote>
** needs screenshot

== Brainstorming ==
How could "birthdays" work in an indieweb way?

=== Reader Feature ===
Is a birthdays summary view a (special) reader feature (since you're already following people)?

=== Microsub Client === 
or a separate mini indieweb app that subscribes to your Microsub endpoint and just shows a birthdays view to interact with?
