A '''<dfn>blogroll</dfn>''' is a list of other sites that you read, are a [[follower]] of, or recommend.

== Why ==

Having a blog roll is a way of giving back to the blogs you enjoy. People who visit your site may be interested in reading similar content. By having a blog roll, visitors can easily find similar websites that they may want to read.

== How to ==
=== How to create or update ===
A good way to start or update a blogroll is by making a list of sites whose content you often bookmark or [[response|respond]] to. You could go through your existing [[reader]] and choose the sites that you enjoy the most to start your blogroll.

A blogroll can be as simple as a list of links that point to a site's homepage, such as:

* [https://indieweb.org IndieWeb]

Optionally, you could provide direct links to the feeds to which you subscribe rather than a site homepage. This is a good idea if you only subscribe to particular feeds on a site, such as a [[notes]] feed or a [[bookmarks]] feed.

You may also want to offer an [[OPML]] download for your blogroll on your site. Offering an OPML file to visitors means they can easily subscribe to all of the feeds to which you are subscribed. This might be desirable to someone new to subscribing to feeds and who may not have many or any existing feed subscriptions.

=== How to re-enable the long lost Links subsystem in [[WordPress]] ===

Install [https://wordpress.org/plugins/eazy-enable-blogroll/ Eazy Enable Blogroll] to re-enable the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager Links Manager] (or add the line of code <code>add_filter( 'pre_option_link_manager_enabled', '__return_true' );</code> to your <code>[https://codex.wordpress.org/Functions_File_Explained functions.php]</code> file or somewhere in a plugin, or theme) and use the provided widgets.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members with blogrolls:

=== Barnaby Walters ===
{{barnabywalters}} has a blogroll marked up with h-card and [[xfn]] since ????-??-??
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/contacts
** As of 2016-05-31, this page is [[404]]

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} displays a list of sites he's following at http://gregorlove.com/following/ since 2016-04-05
* Uses only simple [[h-card]] markup, pending consumers that need something more.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has had the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager built in blogroll] for [[WordPress]] since he started, but began [https://boffosocko.com/2017/06/26/indieweb-blogroll/ actively using one on 6/25/17] with [[xfn]] and updated it relatively significantly on [https://boffosocko.com/2017/11/10/a-following-page/ 2017-11-10]. The [[OPML]] file for his larger firehose feed of followed sites can be found at http://boffosocko.com/wp-links-opml.php. Rather than the previous traditional sidebar blogroll on his front page (or all his pages), he has opted for a much larger [[follow|following]] page to display all the people/sites he's following. In the modern web, people are following a much larger set of people and sites than in the early 2000's blogging era, [https://boffosocko.com/about/following/ this full Following page] is meant to reflect that reality.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} keeps a list of feeds (including blogs) he reads: https://snarfed.org/feeds

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} has a [https://jamesg.blog/blogroll/ blogroll on his personal website]. James' blogroll needs to be updated manually. It is structured as a blog post on his site with a custom /blogroll/ permalink.

James is considering whether he can create an automatically-generated blogroll on his website.

=== Peter Molnar ===
{{petermolnar}} has a [https://petermolnar.net/links.opml links] [[OPML]], along with an [https://petermolnar.net/opml.xsl XSL stylesheet] to make it human readable in the browser. He used to exchange banners with others before the turn of the millenium, because that was the cool thing then and there, and only heard about blogrolls when WordPress came around with it's [https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager now hidden link manager subsystem].

=== Luis Quintanilla ===
{{Lqdev.me}} has a [http://lqdev.me/feed/blogroll blogroll] for blogs and [http://lqdev.me/feed/podroll podroll] for podcasts he's subscribed to. Both pages provide a link to [[OPML]] files for simpler import into RSS feed readers and podcast clients.

=== Joe Crawford ===
{{artlung}} maintains a blogroll on the main page of his blog and also on its own [https://artlung.com/blogroll blogroll] page. It includes OPML view and download capability. Like {{petermolnar}}, his site uses the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager "hidden for new installs" link manager that is built into WordPress].

=== Zachary Kai ===

[https://zacharykai.net/ Zachary Kai] maintains a [https://zacharykai.net/ blogroll] on his site. It's organized by category with a table of contents, and each item has a sentence about it and how he discovered it.

=== Hammy Havoc ===
{{hammyhavoc}} maintains a [https://hammyhavoc.com/following/ blogroll] on his [https://hammyhavoc.com personal blog] via the WordPress Link Manager. He automatically generates an OPML file via the [https://github.com/HammyHavoc/opml-blogroll OPML Blogroll WordPress plugin] he uploaded.

=== Past Examples ===
==== Tantek ====
{{t}} used to manually maintain a blogroll on his [https://tantek.com/log/2002/11.html older blog since 2002-11-01], which he would update each month, during the month, and then let its state at the end of the month be frozen for that month and the permalinks for that month. 
* Most recently: https://tantek.com/log/2008/08.html

==== Tom Morris ====
{{tommorris}} had a [http://tommorris.org/pages/blogroll blogroll separate from his home page].
* [http://tommorris.org/pages/blogroll-about about Tom's blogroll page]

== Examples in the wild ==
More example
* [[User:Melvincarvalho.com]] has a blogroll on his site with a list of co-workers / colleagues "people I know and had the pleasure to work with".
** http://melvincarvalho.com/
* While possibly not updated regularly/maintained, Craig Mod has created a newsletter-blogroll (or newsletterroll?) at https://craigmod.com/essays/newsletters/#good-peoples

== Brainstorming ==

* I have two issues with traditional-style blogrolls: they required maintenance, and have no utility other than existing on your homepage for people to maybe click. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 16:24, 1 July 2013 (PDT)

* Remove maintenance by making blogrolls more tangible — for example derive them from your address book, a feed reader or people you mention. In the past blogrolls often meant “people who’s blogs I read”, and were organised by frequency. All of that information exists/could be derived from feed readers. Similarly, “people I mention” is a tangible, interesting metric which reflects real-world behaviour.

* Blogrolls could also be made more actionable, for example if feed readers were to accept a URL with XFN and h-card on, and subscribe to all of the people, or a filtered subset (e.g. all XFN friends, or h-cards tagged with a particular p-category).

* {{colinwalker}} has both a [https://colinwalker.blog/blogroll/ traditional blogroll] and what would be better described as a "mentionroll" located at https://colinwalker.blog/directory/. The latter is a list of people who have actively interacted with his site or content by means of [[Webmention]]. He has put the code (for [[WordPress]]) on [https://github.com/colin-walker/webmention-directory Github].

* Perhaps upcoming functionality made more easily available by [[Microsub]] will be helpful in extending the idea of a blogroll or [[who to follow]] functionality.

* Brainstorming: how to start or expand a blog roll, perhaps through [[replies]] or [[homepage]] webmentions?

<blockquote>I ditched my blogroll quite some time ago, when I discovered that revising it was a social act with social consequences. One of the principals in the current blogroll debate had swamped my (often inadequate, conceded) ability to cope with moodiness, angry chaff, incessant conflict, and “if you’re not 100% with me you’re 100% against me—AND YOU SUCK!” all-or-nothing thinking.</blockquote>

Doc Searls has been credited with coining the term blogroll [https://web.archive.org/web/20010309105741/http://doc.weblogs.com/2000/12/17 in a blog post on 2000-12-17].

*** <blockquote>As a starting place I manually identified twenty websites with OPML blogrolls. From these I can follow links to find 150 distinct websites.

* How to markup: you can use <code>rel="following"</code> on your blogroll links to indicate they are blogs you are following: https://microformats.org/wiki/xfn-brainstorming#follower_and_following. Additionally if you want to express human social relationships to the people in your blogroll, you may do so with [[XFN]] rel-values.
