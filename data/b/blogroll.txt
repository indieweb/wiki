A '''<dfn>blogroll</dfn>''' is a list of other sites that you read, are a [[follower]] of, or recommend.

== History ==
Doc Searls has been credited with coining the term blogroll [http://doc.weblogs.com/2000/12/17 in a blog post on 2000-12-17].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members with blogrolls:

=== Tom Morris ===
{{tommorris}} has a [http://tommorris.org/pages/blogroll blogroll separate from his home page] since ????-??-??
* [http://tommorris.org/pages/blogroll-about about Tom's blogroll page]

=== Barnaby Walters ===
{{barnabywalters}} has a blogroll marked up with h-card and [[xfn]] since ????-??-??
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/contacts
** As of 2016-05-31, this page is [[404]]

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} displays a list of sites he's following at http://gregorlove.com/following/ since 2016-04-05
* Uses only simple [[h-card]] markup, pending consumers that need something more.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has had the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager built in blogroll] for [[WordPress]] since he started, but began [https://boffosocko.com/2017/06/26/indieweb-blogroll/ actively using one on 6/25/17] with [[xfn]] and updated it relatively significantly on [https://boffosocko.com/2017/11/10/a-following-page/ 2017-11-10]. The [[OPML]] file for his larger firehose feed of followed sites can be found at http://boffosocko.com/wp-links-opml.php. Rather than the previous traditional sidebar blogroll on his front page (or all his pages), he has opted for a much larger [[follow|following]] page to display all the people/sites he's following. In the modern web, people are following a much larger set of people and sites than in the early 2000's blogging era, [https://boffosocko.com/about/following/ this full Following page] is meant to reflect that reality.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} keeps a list of feeds (including blogs) he reads:

* https://snarfed.org/feeds

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} has a list of blogs he recommends at [https://www.jvt.me/blogroll/ https://www.jvt.me/blogroll/]

===Ton Zijlstra===
{{tonz}} publishes an [https://zylstra.org/opml/tonzylstra.opml OPML file] that includes a stylesheet so it becomes [https://zylstra.org/opml/tonzylstra.opml human readable as blogroll]. More details at [https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/my-human-readable-opml-blogroll/]

== Examples in the wild ==
More example
* [[User:Melvincarvalho.com]] has a blogroll on his site with a list of co-workers / colleagues "people I know and had the pleasure to work with".

== Brainstorming ==

* I have two issues with traditional-style blogrolls: they required maintenance, and have no utility other than existing on your homepage for people to maybe click. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 16:24, 1 July 2013 (PDT)

Remove maintenance by making blogrolls more tangible — for example derive them from your address book, a feed reader or people you mention. In the past blogrolls often meant “people who’s blogs I read”, and were organised by frequency. All of that information exists/could be derived from feed readers. Similarly, “people I mention” is a tangible, interesting metric which reflects real-world behaviour.

Blogrolls could also be made more actionable, for example if feed readers were to accept a URL with XFN and h-card on, and subscribe to all of the people, or a filtered subset (e.g. all XFN friends, or h-cards tagged with a particular p-category).

{{colinwalker}} has both a [https://colinwalker.blog/blogroll/ traditional blogroll] and what would be better described as a "mentionroll" located at https://colinwalker.blog/directory/. The latter is a list of people who have actively interacted with his site or content by means of [[Webmention]]. He has put the code (for [[WordPress]]) on [https://github.com/colin-walker/webmention-directory Github].

Perhaps upcoming functionality made more easily available by [[Microsub]] will be helpful in extending the idea of a blogroll or [[who to follow]] functionality.

<blockquote>I ditched my blogroll quite some time ago, when I discovered that revising it was a social act with social consequences. One of the principals in the current blogroll debate had swamped my (often inadequate, conceded) ability to cope with moodiness, angry chaff, incessant conflict, and “if you’re not 100% with me you’re 100% against me—AND YOU SUCK!” all-or-nothing thinking.</blockquote>
