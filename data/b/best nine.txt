'''<dfn>best nine</dfn>''' is a popular aggregation and summary post practice on [[Instagram]], supported by services like https://2017bestnine.com/ ([https://web.archive.org/web/20191123013944/https://2017bestnine.com/ archived], now taken over) which only ask you for your username then return a 3x3 grid of your 9 most liked photos of the year, a photo-specific [[Year in Review]].

== Examples ==
Example result from the 2017bestnine site.

default (with number of likes) and photos-only versions:

== Indieweb BestNine ==

A basic implementation of BestNine for indieweb sites was put together by {{Ruxton}} and is hosted at http://mirror.rhythmandpoetry.net/indieweb-bestnine/ ([https://web.archive.org/web/20191204134808/http://mirror.rhythmandpoetry.net/indieweb-bestnine archived)]). ([https://github.com/Ruxton/indieweb-bestnine source code])

To use it you must have support for:

* [[microformats2]]
* [[like]]

* Brainstorming: It should be possible to build an indieweb version into your own site, or even a service that asked for an indieweb site URL, checked all [[photo]] posts from the past year, created a grid of the top 9 posts by number of likes. Advantage: more total likes from backfeeds and indieweb sites. Extra credit: detect if site delegates webmention receiving to webmention.io or herokuapp, call its API for likes
