* Brainstorming: It should be possible to build an indieweb version into your own site, or even a service that asked for an indieweb site URL, checked all [[photo]] posts from the past year, created a grid of the top 9 posts by number of likes. Advantage: more total likes from backfeeds and indieweb sites. Extra credit: detect if site delegates webmention receiving to webmention.io or herokuapp, call its API for likes
