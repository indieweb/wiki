{{jeremycherfas}} has quite a long history with [https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/2021/looking-at-an-old-post-of-mine blog carnivals]. He hosted some back in the day and lately has tried to revive the idea by [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/weeding-mendels-garden-and-other-blog-carnivals revisiting old posts] and, indeed, [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/looking-for-todays-blog-carnivals searching for the remnants of carnival culture].
