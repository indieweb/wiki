== How To ==

== IndieWeb Examples ==
[https://vonexplaino.com/blog Colin Morris] uses a bookmarklet to find and reply to h-entry elements on the current page.

<pre>
javascript:if (document.querySelector('.h-entry')) { window.open("https://vonexplaino.com/regenerate/reply.php?url=" + encodeURI(window.location.href));} else {child = document.createElement('p');child.style = "width:100%;text-align:center;position:absolute;z-index:4;top:0;color:red;background:white;font-size:xx-large";child.innerText = 'Nope';document.body.appendChild(child);}
</pre>
