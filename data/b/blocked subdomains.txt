<span class="p-summary">The IndieWeb wiki requires that you use [[personal-domain|your own domain]] to log in rather than a subdomain of someone else's domain, and thus has '''<dfn>blocked subdomains</dfn>''' of several popular and typically free blogging or static file hosts.</span> People who use subdomains of these providers to host their [[FAQ#What_is_a_personal_website|personal website]] must set up a [[personal domain]] with [[Web sign-in]] (see [[IndieMark#Level_1|IndieMark: Level 1]]) before they can log in to the wiki.
