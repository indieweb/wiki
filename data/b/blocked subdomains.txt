https://indieweb.org/blocked_subdomains

<span class="p-summary">The IndieWeb wiki requires that you use [[personal-domain|your own domain]] to login rather than a subdomain of someone elseâ€™s domain, and thus has '''<dfn>blocked subdomains</dfn>''' of several popular and typically free blogging or static file hosts.</span> People who use subdomains of these providers to host their [[FAQ#What_is_a_personal_website|personal website]] must setup a [[personal domain]] with IndieAuth (see [[IndieMark#Level_1|IndieMark: Level 1]]) before they can login.

They can currently only be found in [https://github.com/indieweb/mediawiki-extensions/blob/master/LassoAuth.php the LassoAuth extension code].
