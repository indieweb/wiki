A '''<dfn>blue checkmark</dfn>''' is used on some sites to indicate a [[verified]] user account, and other sites as an indicator that the user paid a one time or subscription fee.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] used to (before November 2022) use a blue checkmark to indicate a [[verified]] profile.

Since November 2022, Twitter added an option to their [[Twitter Blue]] premium subscription offering to display a blue checkmark next to your profile

=== Tumblr ===
As a joke, Tumblr started to offer ''two'' blue checkmarks next to your name for a one-time fee of $7.99 (the same as the monthly fee for Twitter Blue).

Tumblr allows purchasing multiple pairs of blue checkmarks and they stack up next to your name:
