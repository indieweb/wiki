=== retro posting ===
A special form of backfill is the creation of back dated posts (retroposting) for content created before the web, or before you started blogging / publishing on the web. See:
* [[throwback#Past_Dating]]

* Pro-tip: do not treat or implement backfilling or any kind of importing as posts as any kind of scripted or automated creating of posts. There's a huge difference between an author creating a post (e.g. via Micropub), and creating post entries directly into storage and rebuilding any indices or archive pages accordingly. Be sure to do the latter, not the former.
