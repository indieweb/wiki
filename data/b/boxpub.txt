Boxpub is a blog engine written in Python that supports serving a blog out of Dropbox.

https://github.com/sivy/boxpub

Boxpub is (sort-of) actively developed by Steve Ivy (https://github.com/sivy/).

Boxpub supports:

* templates stored with content in Dropbox
* supports posts and pages

All content is requested directly from Dropbox on page rendering, therefor is is recommended that a boxpub site be fronted by a caching webserver or content delivery network (CDN).

In the future boxpub may support serving from a filesystem cache.
