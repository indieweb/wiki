A '''<dfn>badge</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>achievement</dfn>) is a visual indicator of completing some sort of accomplishment, usually associated with completing specific tasks within a system that is frequently recognized as "achievement unlocked", or "you unlocked the xyz badge!". Badges typically have a visual icon as well as a short name and description. Badges are typically a [[gamification]] mechanism to encourage users to more actively use a system.

For IndieWeb badges you can use on your own site, see:

__TOC__

=== Foursquare ===
[[Foursquare]] awarded badges for checking in to various kinds of venues, or using certain words in a checkin. Some badges were limited to specific events or geographical areas. Foursquare was largely responsible for the rising popularity of badges in online systems, as evidenced by how many later systems referenced Foursquare's badge feature. There are many fan sites that popped up describing each badge and how to earn them.

=== Swarm ===
[[Swarm]] has largely replaced [[Foursquare]]'s previous use of badges with [[sticker]]s, which are now earned by checking in to venue categories and can then be applied to later checkins to earn more [[coin]]s.

== Brainstorming ==
* A webmention badge should be an h-review
* It can have a rating. If the rating is the criteria for the badge it should be listed or linked to in content.
* Badge criteria may require meeting a threshold on multiple scales. In that case use nested h-reviews and h-review-aggregate. 
* a badge is a badge is a reaction to something on the URL it points at therefore should use  in-reply-to
* Each badge issuance should contain an h-card for the issuer, and h-card for the recipient, the criteria, and a link to evidence.
* Each issuance should be it's own url so the receiver can decide how to display and link.
* A badge should have have a u-photo property in the content. Current best practices suggest not to put photos in replies but there are examples of photo replies such as reactionary gifs or [[photo_reply]]
* A badge may require additional microformats properties specifically p-criteria and p-evidence. Until then using p-note should be considered best practice.
* Badge images should be no greater than 250px and should be SVG when possible.
