A '''<dfn>badge</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>achievement</dfn>) on the IndieWeb is a post or [[home page]] [[button]] showing completion of an accomplishment or self-expressed support for a cause, often for finishing a specific task or passing a test like a validator, displayable with a unique code per person or generically with a [[sticker]] image; there are prototypes for creating, issuing, and displaying peer-to-peer IndieWeb badges via [[Webmention]].

There are other uses of the term badge especially in the context of [[notifications]], e.g. 
* '''[[notification badge]]''' — indicators, usually a red dot, sometimes with a number inside, that a page, feature, application, or [https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/hide-app-notification-badges-home-screen-ios/ OS homescreen] has notifications for viewing and acting on. These are often configured inside "Notifications" settings in an OS or application.
* '''[[application badge]]''' — the presentation of an indicator specifically on an application icon, often implemented on web pages & web apps by modifying the favicon, and some support of the [https://www.w3.org/TR/badging/ W3C Badging API].

__TOC__
Badge systems often recognize an accomplishment with a phrase like "achievement unlocked", or "you unlocked the xyz badge!". 

Badges typically have a visual icon as well as a short name and description. Badges are also used to indicate specific competencies or skills have been met in educational settings. Badges are sometimes part of a [[gamification]] mechanism to encourage users to more actively use a system or as a record of learning.

=== Foursquare ===
[[Foursquare]] awarded badges for checking in to various kinds of venues, or using certain words in a checkin. Some badges were limited to specific events or geographical areas. Foursquare was largely responsible for the rising popularity of badges in online systems, as evidenced by how many later systems referenced Foursquare's badge feature. There are many fan sites that popped up describing each badge and how to earn them.

=== San Francisco Elections ===
San Francisco Elections provides an electronic “I Voted!” badge for folks who vote by mail:

https://sfelections.org/tools/portal/notice/I_voted_sticker.png

=== Open Badges ===
[https://openbadges.org/ Open Badges], is an open technical standard first developed by Mozilla in 2011, with funding from the MacArthur Foundation, to establish a portable and verifiable credentialing system as a portable image file. The badge standard was transitioned to IMS Global Learning Consortium, a members-only organization, as of January 1, 2017. The Mozilla Backpack, a badge displaying tool, was transferred to Badgr.io, a badging platform by Concentric Sky.

=== Baked Data in Open Badges ===
The badging community refers to a baked badge as an img file containing links to metadata properties using JSON-LD. The same properties included in the Open Badges spec are found in an h-entry but the data is not in the HTML and readily available to human readers.

==== Endorsements ====
The Open Badges 2.0 spec, included an endorsement class similar to a [[like]] post from a third party to the permalink of the badge.

==== Open Badges Criticism ====
* '''Pay-to-play barrier.''' The open standard, is now maintained by a pay-to-play members benefit consortium. Contribution to the "open standard" now requires significant dues that may cut off contributions from a long-standing community.
* '''Unnecessary complexity'''. Open Badges uses [[JSON-LD]] for metadata using the schema.org learning vocabulary. 
* '''Patent encumbered.''' In 2018, Pearson, in the face of years of prior art, was granted a patent for digital badges. Their company was then purchased by Credly, who now owns the patent. In the case of "open" badges The rules of IMS Global Learning Consortium allow members rights to other member patents. Thus anyone who wants protection from the patent of an "open" badges standard needs to pay membership dues. In a call with Open Recognition Alliance, a Credly lawyer and a representative noted that the company had no plans to enforce the patent and but will keep it for defensive purposes.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Quick Thoughts ===
* A webmention badge should be an h-review if it has a rating
* It can have a rating. If the rating is the criteria for the badge it should be listed or linked to in content.
* Badge criteria may require meeting a threshold on multiple scales. In that case use nested h-reviews and h-review-aggregate. 
* a badge is a badge is a reaction to something on the URL it points at therefore should use  in-reply-to
* Each badge issuance should contain an h-card for the issuer, and h-card for the recipient, the criteria, and a link to evidence.
* Each issuance should be it's own url so the receiver can decide how to display and link.
* A badge should have have a u-photo property in the content. Current best practices suggest not to put photos in replies but there are examples of photo replies such as reactionary gifs or [[photo_reply]]
* A badge may require additional microformats properties specifically p-criteria and p-evidence. Until then using p-note should be considered best practice...As of 2019-02-27 {{jgmac1106}} began adding the experimental properties p-x-evidence and p-x-criteria to badges
* Badge images should be no greater than 250px and should be SVG when possible.
* The Open Badges spec as an endorsment class, meaning a third party can endorse a badge issued by someone else. How should this be markerd and verifed by both sites so as not to allow spoofing?
* an endorsement of a badge can be sent using a like post similar to [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/12/17/1/like/ this example] published as a like to [toolbuilder-badge] allowing {{eddie}} to endorse the badge.
* an organization with a wiki, such as fandom could use a similar approach to endorse community badges such as:
  * <a class="u-like-of" href="https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/12/17/css-grid-explorer-badge">Endorsement of CSS Grid Explorer Badge</a>

=== Credentialing at the DNS level ===
Webmention badges, using the u-reply-of microformats property, could provide for the ability for the issuer to establish their credibility through the use of their url.

A university websites url, for example, would be attached to any badge sent as a webmention.

This would provide a level of identification and credibility without requiring additional files.

=== Endorsements ===
While no one actually uses endorsements, the addition of the endorsement class was the major feature release in the Open Badges 2.0 spec. Webmention badges handle endorsements using microformat property "u-like-of." So if Company A wanted to endorse Badge offered by Professor X they publish a like post to the badge. 

=== Ledgers and Webmention Badges ===
Third party systems such as webmentions.io can provide a record of badge issuance. A learning network could add their own ledger and syndicate badge issuance using the micrformats property u-syndication-of.
