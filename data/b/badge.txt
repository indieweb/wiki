A '''<dfn>badge</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>achievement</dfn>) is a visual indicator of completing some sort of accomplishment, usually associated with completing specific tasks within a system that is frequently recognized as "achievement unlocked", or "you unlocked the xyz badge!". Badges typically have a visual icon as well as a short name and description. Badges are typically a [[gamification]] mechanism to encourage users to more actively use a system.

For IndieWeb badges you can use on your own site, see:

__TOC__

=== Foursquare ===
[[Foursquare]] awarded badges for checking in to various kinds of venues, or using certain words in a checkin. Some badges were limited to specific events or geographical areas. Foursquare was largely responsible for the rising popularity of badges in online systems, as evidenced by how many later systems referenced Foursquare's badge feature. There are many fan sites that popped up describing each badge and how to earn them.

=== Swarm ===
[[Swarm]] has largely replaced [[Foursquare]]'s previous use of badges with [[sticker]]s, which are now earned by checking in to venue categories and can then be applied to later checkins to earn more [[coin]]s.
