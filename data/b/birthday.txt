A '''<dfn>birthday</dfn>''' is the date when someone is born, however in the context of the indieweb, it is a feature displayed on some silos' user profiles that you can (or must) enter, and some prominently present to your [[friends]] on the month and day of your birthday, like [[Facebook]]'s "BIRTHDAYS THIS WEEK" feature at the top of their [[events]] page.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{acegiak}} on http://acegiak.net/ using <code>dt-bday</code> in her [[h-card]] on her home page since (????-??-??)
* {{aaronpk}} publishes the month and day of his birthday using <code>dt-bday</code> on his home page [[h-card]] since 2016-02
** [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/12/28/5/birthday-balloons since 2016-12-28], Aaron's home page will show balloons floating from the bottom when viewed on his birthday. (Copy this file if you want to use it on your site! https://aaronparecki.com/assets/birthday.js)
* {{sebsel}} added some code to display a cake-emoji next to the profile picture on his main h-card, which also advertises his birthday in mf2, but only on the day itself.
** <code><nowiki><data class="dt-bday" value="--MM-DD">ðŸŽ‚</data></nowiki></code>
* {{martijnvdven}} displays his age and a countdown to his birthday on his website. The countdown, when parsed for [[microformats]] gives the time-of-birth as <code>bday</code> exact to the minute.

== Issues ==
=== Security ===
Birthdays are often used as part of a person's identity and thus publishing a precise accurate birthday pose an identity theft security risk. As a result, people at some IndieWebCamps have self-reported as using non-real birthdays on [[silos]].

== Criticism ==
Birthdays are often used by social networks to create spurious notifications - see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JAYEvvjXqU Friendster's line in this video]
