'''<dfn>bus factor</dfn>''' is a relative measurement of risk concerning a [[project]]'s potential fragility judged by asking the question "Will a project fail if one of its members is hit by a bus?" Also known as train factor, lorry factor, or other variations.

Open source is one way to mitigate high bus factor. If a project is open source, anyone can run it themselves, fork and improve it, and let existing users migrate to their new instance. We've seen this happen a bit with e.g. [[silo.pub]] and [[Woodwind]].
