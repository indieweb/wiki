{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>denyhost</dfn>''' is a service that can be run on a server to automatically mark an IP address as blocked when multiple failed requests are made.

Because the marking as banned is automatic, you should always ensure that your IP address is part of the whitelist - see http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/faq.html#allowed
