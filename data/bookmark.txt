A '''<dfn>bookmark</dfn>''' (or <dfn>linkblog</dfn>) is a [[post]] that is primarily comprised of a URL, often title text from that URL, sometimes optional text describing, [[tag]]ging, or quoting from its contents.

== Why ==
Why should you post bookmark posts? Good question. People seem to have reasons for doing so.
(please feel free to replace this rhetorical question with actual reasoning)

* I bookmark things usually as 'read later', 'will read again' or 'should reference in a paper'. - {{rhiaro}}
* i bookmark other peoples sites or twitter accounts and setting `rel=following` onto links â€“ {{dym_cx}}

== How ==
=== How to markup ===
How to markup a bookmark post. Use an h-entry as usual and a u-bookmark-of property on the link to the actual URL you are bookmarking. E.g.

<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-entry"> ... 
 <a class="u-bookmark-of" href="http://someothersite.example.com/permalink47">...</a>
</span>
</nowiki></pre>

The trailing preposition "of" helps communicate this in the same that we have u-in-reply-to instead of u-reply.

For bookmarks that contain both a link and a meaningful title, consider using "u-bookmark-of h-cite" instead:

<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-entry"> ... 
  <a class="u-bookmark-of h-cite" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-12-04-lts-to-ubuntu-14-04-lts">
    How to Upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
  </a>
</span>
</nowiki></pre>

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] to post bookmarks on his site waterpigs.co.uk as [[notes]] tagged with "[http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/?tagged=bookmark bookmark]" since ????-??-??. These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Tags
* Text note with one or more URLs inline

=== Jeremy Keith ===
[[User:adactio.com|Jeremy Keith]] posts bookmarks on his own site at [http://adactio.com/links/ adactio.com/links] since ????-??-?? and [[POSSE]]s them to [https://delicious.com/adactio Delicious]. These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Title
* tags
* Description

=== Shane Becker ===
{{veganstraightedge}} imports bookmarks to [http://veganstraightedge.com/bookmarks veganstraightedge.com/bookmarks] by [[PESOS]]ing from [[Instapaper]] (tagged with "imported:from=instapaper.com") and [[Pinboard]] (tagged with "imported:from=pinboard.in") since ????-??-??. He sub-categorizes them by adding a "fave", "read-later", "watch-later" or "listen-later" tag to a bookmark post. The linked title of a bookmark post goes to the bookmarked URL, not the bookmark post's permalink. Bookmark posts have a '''â‡œ''' before the title to help indicate that the link goes to an external site. The '''â‡œ''' is applied using a CSS :before selector and a content property to keep it out of the actual HTML/microformat content. These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Title
* tags
* Excerpt (optional)
* Description (optional)

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} has been able to post bookmarks since 2014-10-10, with [[Postly]] though has not used it much yet other than as testing.

=== atomicules ===
[[User:atomicules.co.uk]], taking a slightly different approach, I decided I did not want to host or own every bookmark I make as I would never have a self-hosted tool as quick and as convenient as Pinboard, etc, nor did I want the clutter of bookmarks offtopic to that of my website. I did, however, already have link type posts, so I decided to start syndicating these out to [[Pinboard]] (See that page for my example).

== Silos ==
Bookmark hosting silos:
* [[Instapaper]]
* [[Pinboard]]

The below image is of the bookmark display on Pinboard, which adopts a text-first somewhat minimalist design which shows the name, when it was bookmarked, and by whom. A description and tags can be optionally added.

Previously:
* [[delicious]]

== Similar Post Kinds ==
Text of a '''bookmark post''' is most often the title of the linked resource, i.e. created by the author of the linked resource, rather than the person posting the bookmark post.

This is a key distinction between a bookmark and other kinds of posts.

=== Reply ===
The text of a ''[[reply]]'' is written by the person posting the reply, and often a new statement in response to the original post.

If the text of a bookmark post is written as commentary on the bookmark, then that should likely be a reply post instead.

=== Repost ===
The text of a [[repost]] comes from the entirety of the <em>content</em> of a bookmark rather than the name or title of the bookmarked resource.

If the text of a bookmark post is the entirety of the contents of the thing that is bookmarked, then that should likely be a repost instead.

=== Quotation ===
The text of a [[quotation]] comes from part of the <em>content</em> of a bookmark rather than the name or title of the bookmarked resource.

If the text of a bookmark post is merely part of the contents of the thing that is bookmarked, then that should likely be a quotation instead.
