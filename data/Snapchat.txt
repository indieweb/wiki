'''<dfn>Snapchat</dfn>''' is an ephemeral-[[photo]] hosting [[silo]] where users post photos to their friends, which are viewable for a limited number of seconds, sometimes a few times.

== Criticism ==
=== Outrageous terms & conditions ===

<blockquote>You grant Snapchat a world-wide, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, create derivative works from, publicly perform, broadcast, distribute, syndicate, promote, exhibit, and publicly display that content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods</blockquote>

=== Ephemerality Illusion ===
The 3rd party website SnapSaved.com claimed to save the Snapchat photos you received, which they did but for themselves also. SnapSaved did this by implementing the [[password-antipattern]] by asking for your Snapchat password.[https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/520641459985207296]
