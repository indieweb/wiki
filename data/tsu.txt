( Official description )

== Criticism == 

=== 'It's your content' ===
Many sites are referring to tsū as "Tsu is a social platform that rewards all users for their original content and network. It's your content. Own it.[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tsu]" whereas it's just another walled garden, where you do get paid for content, but you don't own it.

=== No API ===
By 2015-11 tsū doesn't have an API.
