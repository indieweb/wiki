'''<dfn>[http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/ Nike+]</dfn>''' is an exercise activity hosting [[silo]] operated by [[Nike]]. Also written (and spoken) as "Nike Plus".

== API ==
__TOC__
Nike+ has a RESTful read API.
* http://developer.nike.com/ - requires (free) nike.com account to use and even read the documentation.
** https://developer.nike.com/documentation/api-docs/activity-services.html - Activity Services - main documentation page
** https://developer.nike.com/documentation/api-docs/test-console.html - API console - try out any Nike+ REST API calls using your API token (retrievable dynamically with login using the web interface).
* Nike seems to have primarily restricted API access to "Nike Fuel Lab" partners. How you become a partner is not entirely clear, but you can sign up for updates on API access here: https://developer.nike.com/content/nike-developer-cq/us/en_us/index/contact-us.html
* Non-Fuel Lab partners can still grab a temporary (good for a day) access token via: curl 'https://developer.nike.com/services/login' --data-urlencode username='yourmail@gmail.com' --data-urlencode password='your_password
** With this temporary access token you can still make requests to the API outside of the "web console" Nike provides on its site.
