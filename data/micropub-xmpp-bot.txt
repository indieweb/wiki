'''<dfn>micropub-xmpp-bot</dfn>''' is an experimental [[XMPP]] chat bot for posting notes, replies, likes, and reposts to sites that support [[Micropub]].

Created by {{kylewm}} in September 2015.

open source: https://github.com/kylewm/micropub-xmpp-bot/

== How to use it ==
Give it a shot by XMPP chatting with micropub@kylewm.com. (If it's offline, ping "kylewm" on [[IRC]]).

Notably, it uses an out-of-band redirect_uri handler that prompts the user to copy/paste their auth code.
