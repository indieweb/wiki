A '''<dfn>hashflag</dfn>''' is a Twitter feature that displays a graphic beside certain [[hashtag]]s, such as flags beside three-letter country codes. Twitter introduced it in 2010 for the World Cup and brought them back for the 2014 World Cup. For the Star Wars Celebration event in 2015 some hashtags displayed Star Wars graphics.
