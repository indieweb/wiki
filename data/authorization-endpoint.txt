An '''<dfn>authorization endpoint</dfn>''' is an HTTP endpoint that [[micropub]] and [[IndieAuth]] clients can use to identify a user or obtain an authorization code to be able to post to their website. 

== Protocol ==
An authorization endpoint has to implement the [[IndieAuthProtocol]].

=== Identification header ===
Every endpoint MUST return a
<pre>IndieAuth: authorization_endpoint</pre>
HTTP header in all responses.

This is used by clients to verify that the server understands the IndieAuth protocol.


== Software implementing the authorization endpoint spec ==
* [[indieauth.com]]
* [[indieauth-openid]]
* [[indiecert]]
* [[silo.pub]]
