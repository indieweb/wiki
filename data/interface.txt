'''<dfn>Interface</dfn>''' most often refers to [[user-interface]] in the context of the IndieWeb, since we're a user-centric / [[design]]-centric / UX before protocols&formats [[principles]] crowd.

Less often, use of "interface" may sometimes refer to "application programming interface" AKA [[API]].
