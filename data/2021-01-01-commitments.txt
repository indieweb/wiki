=== Your Name Here ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} baring any crazy technical hurdles, I'm going to refresh my [[Known]] install and get it running properly again.
** 2020-12-21 After more than a year of repeated database issues with my [[Known]] install, I think I've fixed the issue and have gotten my secondary site up and running again! Now to come up with a stretch goal? Dare I update to the bleeding edge or at least the current stable? Maybe just put it through some paces to make sure all the other small bits are still working properly.
* {{ana-r}} I want to break my content into different sections and spice up my layout with a couple of drawings. 
* {{cambridgeport90}} I need to move my site from micro.blog back to my own self-hosted Wordpress site.
