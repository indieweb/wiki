'''<dfn>[http://storytlr.org Storytlr]</dfn>''' is an open-source lifestreaming platform. It automaticaly syndicates content from many social services (twitter, youtube, flickr, etc.) and supports content publishing with syndication to Twitter. Making it a great tool for either a [[POSSE]] or a [[PESOS]] approach to the indieweb. Other features include Activitystream feed with PuSH support, Webfinger support, microformats support, AtomPub API (experimental), Pingback and more.
