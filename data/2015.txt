== Collaborative Sessions ==
Notes from organizers (and [[2014]] participants) about what did and did not work for cross-city collaborative sessions:

=== What worked ===
* good cameras and microphones are super important - {{aaronpk}}
* the shared sessions worked well when there was
*# a camera with a good view of the people and whiteboard
*# someone monitoring IRC for questions - {{bear}}

=== Challenges ===
* the dilemma with large time zone swings was being able to participate in another cities remote session - {{bear}}
* it's never easy and requires lots of prior planning - {{bear}}

=== Things to try this year ===
* we could make sure certain "domain experts" are known so everyone could make use of them, something like "[[HTTPS]] Hour with bear and ..." - {{bear}}

== FAQ ==
=== Why multiple cities ===
Q: What's the rationale for having separate IWCs simultaneously?

A: tl;dr: The short answer is - because people stepped up to organize.

IWC East happened because {{JeremyZilar}} wanted to host an IWC in NYC simultaneously with the one in Portland.

Then IWC Farther East happened because {{bnvk}} wanted to host on IWC in Berlin simultaneously.

The overall rationale(s) is/are because:
* Someone took the initiative and wanted to, and 
* it seemed more in the indie spirit as well as 
* more decentralized in spirit to encourage and enable multiple locations
