'''<dfn>[https://pfefferle.github.io/openwebicons/ OpenWeb Icons]</dfn>''' is a web-font that gives you scalable vector icons/logos of some open communities, standards or projects. It is being maintained by {{pfefferle}} and was created because [[Font Awesome]] had no icon for [[RSS]].

It is especially helpful within the IndieWeb community for its inclusion of the IWC [[logo]], the [[Webmention]] logo, and several [[microformats]] icons.
