== What is the IndieWeb? ==
<span class="p-summary">The <dfn style="font-style:normal">IndieWeb</dfn> is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. </span>

| '''Your content is yours'''<br>When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and [[site-deaths|lost all of their users’ data]]. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.<br><br>
|-
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" |[[file:icon_31635.png|48px]]
| '''You are better connected'''<br>Your articles and status messages can [[POSSE|go to all services]], not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Even replies and likes on other services can [[backfeed|come back to your site]] so they’re all in one place.<br><br>
|-
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" background-color: #f9f9f9; |[[file:icon_2003.png|48px]]
|'''You are in control'''<br>You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as ''example.com/ideas''. These links are [[permalinks|permanent]] and will always work.<br><br>

* Interested? [[Getting_Started|Get Started Now!]]
* View [[irc/today|current discussions]] and [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes to this site]] to see what we've been working on lately
* Check out [[Projects|projects we're building]] and [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=indiewebcamp&nick=indie-visitor join the discussion]

=== Beyond Blogging and Decentralization ===
The IndieWeb effort is [[different]] from previous efforts/communities:
* '''[[Principles]]''' over project-centrism. Others assume a [[monoculture]] of one project for all. We are developing a [[principles#Plurality|plurality of projects]].
* '''[[Selfdogfood]]''' instead of email. Show before tell. Prioritize by scratching your own itches, [[creator|creating]], iterating on your own site.
* '''[[Design]]''' first, protocols & formats second. Focus on good UX & selfdogfood prototypes to create minimum necessary [[formats]] &amp; [[protocols]].
Perhaps most importantly, we are people-focused instead of project-focused, and have regular meetups where everyone is welcome:

== Homebrew Website Club ==

'''<dfn>Homebrew Website Club</dfn>''' is a (bi)weekly meetup of creatives passionate about designing, improving, building, and actively using their own websites, sharing their successes and challenges with a like-minded and supportive community. We have adopted a similar structure as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club classic Homebrew Computer Club] meetings. [http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter]

We typically meet every other Wednesday<abbr title="skipping any official US Holidays">*</abbr> right after work, 18:30-19:30, across cities and [[IRC|online]]. Some locations also have a 17:30-18:30 Quiet Writing Hour beforehand. Edinburgh is meeting every week, and some cities meet on Tuesdays!
