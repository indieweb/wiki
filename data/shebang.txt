{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>shebang</dfn>''' (or '''hashbang''') is the character sequence <code>#!</code>. In web development, it has been used in URLs to make [[AJAX]] content searchable by giving it a pseudo-URL. This is problematic because it relies on [[javascript]] to retrieve the content and can easily break.
