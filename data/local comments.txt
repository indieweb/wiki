{{stub}}

'''<dfn>local comments</dfn>''' are [[comments]] that are made directly (locally) on a [[post]] in the UI of the site serving the post, instead of posting a [[reply]] post on an indieweb site and sending a [[webmention]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

[[Known]] (optionally) supports local comments using almost the same mechanism as comments received by webmentions. A local comment is given its own permalink URL, where it is the top-level item on the page, on the receiving site.

* e.g. http://known.kevinmarks.com/2014/trying-out-the-known-version-of-indieweb/annotations/1fdc8926b9307d390ce2a69f271e4fc4 is a comment on http://known.kevinmarks.com/2014/trying-out-the-known-version-of-indieweb
