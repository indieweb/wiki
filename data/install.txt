'''<dfn>install</dfn>''' (or <dfn>installation</dfn>) is the act of putting software (e.g. an indieweb [[project]]) onto a (typically their own) [[mobile]] device or [[server]], from a [[store]], website, or modular storage (USB, CD, disk), and setting it up to the point of being able to actively use it.

A simple install is essential to making the indieweb more accessible to more [[generations]], ideally a [[one-click-install]].
