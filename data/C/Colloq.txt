'''<dfn>[https://colloq.io/ Colloq]</dfn>''' is a service to find and track [[events]], used as part of [[2018/Nuremberg|IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2018]] [https://colloq.io/events/indiewebcamp/2018/nurnberg/1].

== How to ==
=== How to POSSE to ===
No known way of [[POSSE]]ing automatically, though there is at least one manual POSSE example:
* https://colloq.io/events/indiewebcamp/2018/nurnberg/1
** original: http://indiewebcamp.com/2018/Nuremberg

Colloq's event display appears to be very "POSSE positive", as it contains a clear boxed link that says <blockquote style="background:#EEE;padding:0.3em 2em; display:inline-block"> Visit the website of the event </blockquote>
that links back to the original [[event]] page.

== IndieWeb Support ==
No known indieweb support yet, like no [[microformats2]] (e.g. [[h-event]]) markup on event permalink pages (as of 2018-026).
