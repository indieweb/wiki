'''<dfn>[http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/ CC0]</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for '''Creative Commons Zero''' and an internationally-aware form of a public domain declaration.

The IndieWebCamp site and wiki requires CC0 for all contributions, and provides all content under CC0.

=== Use For Software ===
While most Creative Commons licenses aren't intended for software, [https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ#May_I_apply_CC0_to_computer_software.3F_If_so.2C_is_there_a_recommended_implementation.3F CC0 can be used for dedicating software] but notes that the lack of patent right licensing could be an issue. The license has been [https://creativecommons.org/2011/04/15/using-cc0-for-public-domain-software/ approved by the Free Software Foundation] but not the Open Source Initiative.

The IndieWeb community [https://github.com/indieweb/wiki/issues/39 has considered recommending CC0 licenses for software].
