==== Search ====

The most recent versions of all resources + metadata are stored in a SQLite database as JSON under Full Text Search (FTS) mode. Local results are shown to all searchers. DuckDuckGo results are paired on the page when logged in as owner.

OpenSearch is supported. Using it you can register your site's search endpoint in your browser so that searches through your address bar are routed through your website.
