{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Client-Side Rendering</dfn>''' is a web development technique for showing a web page in a browser by starting with minimal HTML from the server with some [[JavaScript]] that constructs the page structure, style, and often content within the browser (usually to the detriment of search engines and the Internet Archive which execute little if any script), as opposed to [[Server-Side Rendering]] which serves complete HTML, CSS, and content easily archivable, and indexable by search engines.
