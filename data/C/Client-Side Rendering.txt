'''<dfn>Client-Side Rendering</dfn>''' is when a mostly empty HTML document is returned with JavaScript that builds and renders the page within the browser, this is opposed to [[Server-Side Rendering]] which returns the content within the HTTP request and allows the content to be parsed without any additional rendering.
