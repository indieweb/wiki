=== Goals ===

I am building this Micropub client with a few goals in mind:

* Be as spec-compliant as possible.
* Look good and support modern features such as system-based dark mode and reduced motion preference.
* Make self-hosting as easy as configuring environment variables followed by `docker-compose up`.
* Make IndieWeb accessible to less technically inclined folks.
* To make something useful for myself and others while I figure out and learn backend content.

‚≠ê If you'd like to show me some support, please star the project. ü•∞
