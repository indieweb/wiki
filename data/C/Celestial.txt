'''Celestial'''

{{hirusi}} is building a Micropub client with the following few goals in mind:

* Be as spec-compliant as possible.
* Look good and support system-based dark mode.
* Make self-hosting as easy as configuring environment variables followed by `docker-compose up`.
* Make IndieWeb accessible to less technically inclined folks.
* To make something useful for myself and others while she figures out and learns backend content.

If you'd like to show her some support, please star the project. â™¥
