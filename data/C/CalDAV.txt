{{stub}}

'''<dfn>CalDAV</dfn>''' is a protocol for syncing calendars. It is an extension of [[WebDAV]].

== Why ==
=== Why use CalDAV ===
CalDAV is already implemented in most calendaring software (including Apple's Calendar, Google's Android platform, Outlook, Busycal, Fantastical etc.) and is useful for sharing private calendars, or allowing read/write operations on ICS-based calendars.

=== Why host your own ===
* Because the existing silos that people use are a fiddle to use:
** iCloud is pretty much exclusively for people who use Apple iOS/Mac devices meaning sharing a calendar with people on other platforms is harder
** Google Calendar requires everyone to have a Google login, and some of us are deliberately trying to reduce our reliance on Google-hosted stuff (because of [[site-deaths]] and because of Google's involvement with surveillance)
* To be able to add our own policy/logic, storage backends, backup etc.
* Because some of that data may need to be shared.

== How to ==
(stub) - to be filled in with various How tos, e.g. 
* How to deploy/activate CalDAV on your web server
* How to configure various clients to use your web server's CalDAV endpoint
etc.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{template:cweiske}} uses caldav via his [[ownCloud]] instance.
* [[User:upon2020.com| Johannes Ernst]] and his family use caldav support in [[ownCloud]] (installed on a home server running [[UBOS]]) to synchronize their family calendar across a gaggle of PCs, Macs, phones and tablets. As this is a private calendar, it is access-controlled and I can't provide a (useful) link here.
* [[User:Jonnybarnes.uk|jonnybarnes]] (2014) syncs his calendars using [[ownCloud]]'s CalDAV feature.
* {{johanbove}} uses [[baikal]] as a web based server ([[PHP]] + [[SQLite]]) hosted on a shared web host to store and serve CalDAV calendars and [[CardDAV]] address books which he syncs to IOS and [[Thunderbird]] ([[CardBook]] addon).

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Apple iCloud]]
* [[Google Calendar]] (I think? Not certain. Anyone who uses CalDAV with gCal? -t)
* Busycal (not sure if silo or client)
* Fantastical (not sure if silo or client)

== Client Support ==
* [[Apple]] iOS Calendar
* [[Apple]] OSX Calendar
* [[Google]] Android Calendar
* Windows Outlook

== Server Software Support ==
* [http://radicale.org/ Radicale] is a Python/WSGI implementation of CalDAV and [[CardDAV]], and also does sync over WebDAV and basic HTTP(S). It's GPL3 licensed.
* [http://sabre.io/ sabre.io]  The open source CardDAV, CalDAV and WebDAV server. 
* [https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal Baikal] Ba√Økal is a lightweight CalDAV + CardDAV server based on PHP, SQLite and SabreDAV.
* OwnCloud also comes with a calendar module - [http://www.maketecheasier.com/self-hosted-calendar-server-with-owncloud/ details here].

== Brainstorming ==
=== HTML with h-event storage ===
* It might be an idea to use version controlled HTML containing microformats2 [[h-event]] markup as a back-end for interoperability, backup and so on.
