'''<dfn>[https://www.classicpress.net/ ClassicPress]</dfn>''' is a community fork of [[WordPress]] that emerged due to resistance to the introduction of the Gutenberg visual editor.

While the initial impetus was the decision to switch from a traditional editor to the block editor, it has added numerous other features based on community interest, including replacing older javascript libraries with native HTML or JS for speed, inclusion of media categories/tags, a new object relationship table, and more.
