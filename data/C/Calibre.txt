'''<dfn>[https://calibre-ebook.com Calibre]</dfn>''' is a free and open source [[e-book]] and document [[personal_library|library]] management application.

Development for the project occurs on GitHub at https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre.

Calibre offers a [[Goodreads]] plugin that can be used to sync most of one's reading and library data from that [[silo]] to Calibre. This is a relatively user-friendly way to effect export of one's data from the Goodreads [[silo]].
