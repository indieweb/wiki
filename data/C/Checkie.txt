'''<dfn>[https://s3.amazonaws.com/tijo/checkie.html Checkie]</dfn> is an open source [[checkin]] iOS app for [[Foursquare]] (like an ultraminimal [[Swarm]]).

Github: https://github.com/aaronpk/Checkie

== Brainstorming ==
=== Micropub support ===
[[Micropub]] support would be awesome! So you could check-in to your own website, perhaps even simultaneously with checking in to Foursquare/Swarm!
