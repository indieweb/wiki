'''<dfn>[https://cooklang.org Cooklang]</dfn>''' is a Recipe Markup Language that some people are using to mark-up recipes so that they are both human-readable and can be used as a shopping list and streamlined recipe stages, stripped of any extra writing.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Anthony Ciccarello ===
{{aciccarello}} Uses cooklang to mark up some recipes on his website using a markdown-it plugin since [https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/commit/3f5e0a512b596b319e7d1fce1ff3075f23a3ec21 2022-04-25]. He uses some regex on the output to add microformats.
