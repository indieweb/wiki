'''<dfn>Cambridge</dfn>''' is a city in the greater Boston, Massachusetts (MA) area where [[IndieWebCamp]] events have been held (hosted at MIT), in [[2014/Cambridge|2014]], [[2015/Cambridge|2015]], and twice in 2016 ([[2016/MIT]], [[2016/MIT2]]).

The local area has been one of the W3C’s physical offices for a long time. 

The area was also home to many of the early internet pioneers and the ARPANET network was managed from the offices of Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. who built and designed much of the infrastructure and hardware for the network.

It’s also home to a lot of [[open source]] developers and several organizations.
