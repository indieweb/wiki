'''<dfn>[https://github.com/kbsriram/checkmention Checkmention]</dfn>''' is a project by [https://github.com/kbsriram KB Sriram] that allows people to test their [[Webmention]] implementation, and whether it robustly detects certain types of XSS attacks and [[authorship#Spoofing|authorship spoofing]] attacks.

Previously it was available as a public service on <nowiki>https://checkmention.appspot.com/</nowiki>, but that instance is down at least as of May 2021.
