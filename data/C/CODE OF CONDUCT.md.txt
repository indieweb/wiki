'''<dfn>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</dfn>''' is the convention of adding a file at the root of an open source project with its [[Code of Conduct]].

== Examples ==

* https://github.com/bundler/bundler
* https://github.com/darkmatterapp/publisher-server-rails
* https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora

== Variations ==

Some projects use lowercase for the filename:

Some use just the (uppercase) word "CONDUCT" (with .md or .markdown file extension) for the filename:

* https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org
