'''<dfn>[https://css-tricks.com/ CSS-Tricks]</dfn>''' is an online publication run by [https://chriscoyier.net/ Chris Coyer] and [https://css-tricks.com/about/ a team] that focuses on web development ([[CSS]], [[HTML]], [[Javascript]]) and about building websites in general from a front-end perspective, and occasionally publishes an article about the IndieWeb and IndieWeb [[building blocks]] like [[Webmention|Webmentions]].

Articles about or mentioning the IndieWeb:
* 2016-09-19 Chris Coyier [https://css-tricks.com/wordpress-apple-news-instant-articles-amp/ From WordPress to Apple News, Instant Articles, and AMP ] <blockquote><blockquote>I like the idea of writing on MY site and publishing wherever people will read it.<br>— Chris Coyier (@chriscoyier) [https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/777610145245327360 September 18, 2016]</blockquote><p>Not a far cry from an RSS feed. It's the idea behind IndieWeb:</p><blockquote>POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.</blockquote>

== Respun Content Site Spam ==
There appears to be a significant number of sites scraping CSS-Tricks articles [https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1344194349446393856 for SEO/Ad value]. Chris Coyier [https://css-tricks.com/scrapers-wear-doodoo-hats/ has stated] that it is not a concern for CSS-Tricks, but it can cause issues when a site supporting [[Webmentions]]/[[Pingback]] is mentioned.

* 2020-12-29 [https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1344095187098685440 Shawn Wang] <blockquote>One thing I learned from getting published in @CSS Tricks is the *sheer amount* of sites that solely exist to repost CSS Tricks.</blockquote>
* 2022-06-09 [https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/09/the-spam/ Miriam Eric Suzanne] <blockquote>The other day, I posted an article about implementing webmentions on this site. Today, I’m battling an endless stream of spam in my mentions.</blockquote>

As a solution, Shawn Wang, Max Böck, and others have put together a [https://github.com/sw-yx/domainblocklist block list] that people can use to ignore some of these sites.
