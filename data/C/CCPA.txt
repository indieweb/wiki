{{stub}} 

<span class="p-summary">The '''[https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa <dfn>CCPA</dfn> (California Consumer Privacy Act)]''' is a sweeping new set of data privacy laws that apply to businesses serving California consumers. It's broadly similar to the [[GDPR]]. It covers somewhat more data, requires more to comply, and its penalties are smaller, but otherwise it's very comparable.

== Does it apply to my IndieWeb site or service? ==

Here are the [https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/CCPA%20Fact%20Sheet%20%2800000002%29.pdf criteria that determine whether something is subject to the CCPA]. Right now, most IndieWeb sites and services are small enough that they'll be exempt.

<blockquote>
* Has gross annual revenues in excess of $25 million;
* Buys, receives, or sells the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices;
* Derives 50 percent or more of annual revenues from selling consumersâ€™ personal information.
</blockquote>

== Can I use it to get my data out of silos? ==

Maybe! [https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation Microsoft has announced relatively broad new functionality to comply with it, for example. Facebook and Google, less so.]

Here's what the CCPA requires for users:

<blockquote>
* The ''right to know'' what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold...
* The ''right to delete'' personal information held by businesses...
* The ''right to opt-out'' of sale of personal information...
* The ''right to non-discrimination'' in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right under CCPA.
</blockquote>
