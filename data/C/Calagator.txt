'''<dfn>[http://calagator.org/ Calagator]</dfn>''' is an [[event]] hosting [[silo]] and [[aggregator]] that supports importing events marked up with [[hCalendar]].

== POSSE to Calagator ==
It is possible to manually [[POSSE]] to Calagator. If you're doing so, maintain as many of your structured fields as possible.

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}} manually POSSEs his indie [[event]]s to Calagator since at least [https://aaronparecki.com/events/2014/12/03/1/homebrew-website-club 2014-12-03]. E.g.
* Original indie event: https://aaronparecki.com/events/2014/12/03/1/homebrew-website-club
** POSSE Calagator copy: http://calagator.org/events/1250467428

== Features ==
* Event pages support a limited subset of HTML for formatting and embedding images
* Home page shows a list of upcoming events
* Events can be tagged, and tag pages show upcoming and past events with that tag
* Provides an iCal feed of events
* Previous events can be cloned (rather than supporting recurring events)
* Events can be listed as taking place at a venue, and venues have URLs that list all future and past events there
* Import events from Facebook, hCalendar, iCalendar, Meetup, and Plancast

== Feature Requests ==
=== Create from h-event ===
* https://github.com/calagator/calagator/issues/240

Ideally one should be able to automatically POSSE to Calagator, which, if issue 240 is implemented/resolved, then you should be able to do so with:
* <nowiki>a curl GET of http://calagator.org/sources/new?url='+escape(indieEventPermalink)</nowiki>

=== Webmention RSVP support ===
It would be great to be able to:
* post an indie [[RSVP]] post in-reply-to a Calagator event permalink (doable today per your own site)
* send a webmention to Calagator
** requires Calagator event permalinks have discoverable [[webmention]] endpoints
* have Calagator process that [[RSVP]] response
** requires Calagator's webmention endpoint to fetch/verify/ and check for [[RSVP]] markup
** requires Calagator to handle webmention updates (e.g. for people changing their RSVP)
** nice to have: Calagtor to handle webmention [[delete]] (e.g. for people that just want to delete any reference to an event at all)
* have Calagator display that RSVP
** requires Calagator's event RSVP designs to add show indie RSVPs in "Attending" (or Maybe or Not), along with when RSVP was posted/received, hyperlinked to permalink of RSVP

=== IndieAuth Sign-In ===
The instance at calagator.org has been the target of some spam. Their solution was to add a captcha, which has eliminated most of the spam. For our purposes, it would be great if it also supported IndieAuth sign-in.

== Using Calagator for IndieWeb Events ==
We've had [[Events#Separate_Events_Site|some discussion]] about creating a separate events site for IndieWeb events outside of the wiki, which could solve some of the challenges of using our wiki to maintain events lists. Below is a list of what about the Calagator software would need to change to be able to support our use cases.

==== Requirements ====
These features must be in Calagator in order for it to match our use cases. In other words, without these, there is no reason to start using Calagator.

* Multi-city events or sub/parent events may be a dealbreaker or might not. some of this can be solved with tags, or including links between events
* ...

==== Good Ideas ====
Things that would make Calagator a significant improvement over our current solution, but can wait until after an initial launch.

* Sub-events/parent events. e.g. each city's HWC could be linked as a sub-event of the main "HWC April 11th" event. Currently Calagator would have each city listed as a totally separate event with individual venues.
* Calagator events should support receiving [[Webmention]] and accepting and showing indie [[RSVP]] responses. (Not required since our current wiki does not support this either.)
** Show Webmention comments
** Show photos received via Webmention comments
* Upload photos to events afterwards (currently possible by using img tags and hotlinking files from the wiki or elsewhere)
* ...

==== Complete Solution ====
The features below would mean Upcoming would be the only solution we would need for events.

* Have some from of ticketing, 
** Registering for free tickets, without first signing in with your website
** Handling payment for Indie Web Summit ticket sales
* ...
