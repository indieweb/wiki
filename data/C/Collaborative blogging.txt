'''<dfn>Collaborative blogging</dfn>''' is when you write a blog post with one or more person, which some IndieWeb community members have done.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* [https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/21/quiet-art-the-tapestry-of-writing Quiet art; the tapestry of writing] was written jointly by {{sarajaksa}} and {{capjamesg}}. The post was written in real time using a Google Doc.
* [https://jamesg.blog/2025/04/12/painting-impressions Painting impressions with Zachary] was written by {{zacharykai.net}} and {{capjamesg}} asynchronously, with each taking their time to write a response and then collating them on each other's blogs.

<blockquote>
This is a collaborative project blog where a couple Bearbloggers get together and write posts about Bearblog, the indie web in general, and more.</blockquote>

== Types of collaborative blogging ==

* Synchronous: writing together at the same time.
* Asynchronous: contributing at different times.

<blockquote>Blogging still feels very single player. Despite the fact that almost all of my longer writing goes through Google Docs and a heavy process of notes, comments and discussion - when I publish a blog post it’s “flat” in a way that a Google Doc is “alive”. How do we bring this co-creation, collaboration and discussion to the web?</blockquote>

* The IndieWeb Carnivals like [[IndieWeb_Carnival|IndieWeb Carnival]] and [[IndieWeb_Movie_Club|IndieWeb Movie Club]] are in a sense collaborative blogging, but they are more focused on an individual's response that is then collated into a round-up rather than being a place to write a blog post with someone directly (although this could be a fun topic for a future carnival!).
* [https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/do-blogs-need-to-be-so-lonely/ Do blogs need to be so lonely?] asks and explores the question "If the web is participatory, and I really think it is, then how come blogging can feel so lonely?"
<blockquote>So why not collaborative blogging? Why not groups of people coming together to create personal blogs? Something less formal than a journalist collective, but more communal than a personal blog. Blogging collectively opens us up to a new kind of content, one in which members of the blog are in conversation with one another in a way that’s comfortable and unique.</blockquote>
