'''<dfn>Collaborative blogging</dfn>''' is when you write a blog post with one or more person, which some IndieWeb community members have done.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* [https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/21/quiet-art-the-tapestry-of-writing Quiet art; the tapestry of writing] was written jointly by {{sarajaksa}} and {{capjamesg}}. The post was written in real time using a Google Doc.
* [https://jamesg.blog/2025/04/12/painting-impressions Painting impressions with Zachary] was written by {{zacharykai.net}} and {{capjamesg}} asynchronously, with each taking their time to write a response and then collating them on each other's blogs.

== Types of collaborative blogging ==

* Synchronous: writing together at the same time.
* Asynchronous: contributing at different times.

<blockquote>Blogging still feels very single player. Despite the fact that almost all of my longer writing goes through Google Docs and a heavy process of notes, comments and discussion - when I publish a blog post it’s “flat” in a way that a Google Doc is “alive”. How do we bring this co-creation, collaboration and discussion to the web?</blockquote>

* The IndieWeb Carnivals like [[IndieWeb_Carnival|IndieWeb Carnival]] and [[IndieWeb_Movie_Club|IndieWeb Movie Club]] are in a sense collaborative blogging, but they are more focused on an individual's response that is then collated into a round-up rather than being a place to write a blog post with someone directly (although this could be a fun topic for a future carnival!).
