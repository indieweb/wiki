== Issues ==
* Though not a Google project, contributors must sign a CLA granting a copyright license to Google [http://camlistore.org/code#contributing]
** Does that mean Google owns the IP? [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-02/line/1406996886 snarfed doesn't think so]
** [[User:Martin.atkins.me.uk]]: The repo itself lists [https://camlistore.googlesource.com/camlistore/+/master/AUTHORS many people, along with Google itself] as partial copyright holders. [The Individual CLA https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual] speaks to granting Google copyright and patent *licences*, but does not seem to imply a transfer of ownership.
