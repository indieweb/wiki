=== Using Contact Lists on Our Own Site ===

'''The following was synthesized by {{jacky}} on 2020-03-25 at 19:39 PST'''

During a [https://events.indieweb.org/2020/03/online-homebrew-website-club-west-coast-5CZGhYbdcga1 IWC Session], there was a notion around bridging a concept of "contact lists". The source of the lists' contact wasn't important; but as long as it could provide a [[WebSub]]-enabled '''[[h-feed]]''' of '''[[h-card]]'''s. An idea floated (by {{jacky}}) was to provide a page that pulled from a group in a personal CardDav server that would generate h-cards that one could use to determine one's "identity".

Some consuming cases of such a feed could be the following:

* a site that supports [[AutoAuth]] to gate a [[private post]] from the general public to a fixed list of people.
* controlling who can send replies to a post by a site's internal logic (i.e: [[ACL]])

A pet name for this concept is '''<dfn>MicroDav</dfn>'''.
