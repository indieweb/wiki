'''<dfn>[https://css-naked-day.org/ CSS Naked Day]</dfn>''' is an event on April 9th of each year where participants delete or disable the [[CSS]] on their website, to show their content in its raw form.

== Motivation ==

While many participants do it simply for fun, there are other motivations

=== Accessibility ===

Over time, we have a tendency to disregard [[semantic HTML]], instead patching issues with CSS. This is a problem for [[accessibility]] because screen readers have a hard time distinguishing the intention of elements without proper HTML markup. By making all HTML glaringly obvious, issues become apparent very clearly. (See [[#Indieweb Examples]])

=== Community ===

In many ways, CSS naked day is like the indieweb or [[webrings]]. It builds a community of like minded developers by providing a common goal.

== Textual Internetting ==

* Some browsers like felynx/elynx/[[Lynx]] and w3c are designed to be used from the terminal, providing an experience very close to CSS naked day all year
* Some indieweb writers maintain mirrors of their website on text only HTTP alternatives like [[Gemini]] and [[Gopher]]

== Indieweb Examples ==

{{addyourself}}

=== 2022 ===

* {{Evan Boehs}} improved the accessibility of his website in the following ways:
** Tried (failed) making his post list cards more accessible by following [https://inclusive-components.design/cards/ this guide]
** Making his frontmatter and footer links a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl definition list] (instead of a simple <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and a patch with CSS)
** Using a list of cards instead of divs in order
** Like {{aciccarello}}, making his SVG's the right size
* {{jacky}}, as of April 2022 participates in CSS Naked Day
* {{aciccarello}} participated this year. Finally got around to reducing the default size of some svg icons which filled the screen without CSS.

=== 2024 ===

* {{aciccarello}} participated this year via a client side JavaScript tag (local time only, not 50 hour international day).

== Brainstorming ==
=== Why ===
Brainstorming why: 

It's a good day to strip all the styling of your website and start again from scratch with a redesign.
