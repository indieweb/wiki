[https://css-naked-day.github.io CSS Naked Day] is an event on April 9th of each year. Participants delete all their [[CSS]], opting to show their [[domain]] in it's raw form.

== Motivation ==

While many participants do it simply for fun, there are other motivations

=== Accessibility ===

Over time, we have a tenancy to disregard [[semantic HTML]], instead patching issues with CSS. This is a problem for [[accessibility]] because screen readers have a hard time distinguishing the intention of elements without proper HTML markup. By making all HTML glaringly obvious, issues become apparent very clearly. (See [[#Indieweb Examples]])

=== Community ===

In many ways, CSS naked day is like the indieweb or [[webrings]]. It builds a community of like minded developers by providing a common goal.

== Textual Internetting ==

* Some browsers like felynx/elynx/[[lynx]] and w3c are designed to be used from the terminal, providing an experience very close to CSS naked day all year
* Some indieweb writers maintain mirrors of their website on text only HTTP alternatives like [[Gemini]] and [[Gopher]]

== Indieweb Examples ==

=== 2022 ===

* {{Evan Boehs}} improved the accessibility of his website in the following ways:
** Making his post list cards more accessible by following [https://inclusive-components.design/cards/ this guide]
** Making his frontmatter and footer links a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl definition list] (instead of a simple <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and a patch with CSS)
* {{aciccarello}} participated this year. Finally got around to reducing the default size of some svg icons which filled the screen without CSS.

* Apparently the "CSS Naked Day" page on Wikipedia has been created and deleted 5 times from 2006-2022. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Naked_Day

* Brainstorming why: It's also a good day to strip all the styling of your website and start again from scratch with a redesign.
