[https://css-naked-day.github.io CSS Naked Day] is an event on April 9th of each year. Participants delete all their [[CSS]], opting to show their [[domain]] in it's raw form.

== Motivation ==

While many participants do it simply for fun, there are other motivations

=== Accessibility ===

Over time, we have a tenancy to disregard [[semantic HTML]], instead patching issues with CSS. This is a problem for [[accessibility]] because screen readers have a hard time distinguishing the intention of elements without proper HTML markup. By making all HTML glaringly obvious, issues become apparent very clearly. (See [[#Indieweb Examples]])

=== Community ===

In many ways, CSS naked day is like the indieweb or [[webrings]]. It builds a community of like minded developers by providing a common goal.
