'''<dfn>[https://craftcms.com/ Craft]</dfn>''' is a commercial [[PHP]]/[[MySQL]] [[CMS]] and eCommerce platform, with both hosted and self-hosted options. See [https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/ how to get started] for installation or check out their [https://craftcms.com/docs/ documentation].

Craft is available for use under [https://craftcms.com/pricing several different licenses], both paid-for and free. The free license notably still includes all localisation and content editing tools, whilst paid licenses introduce team functionality such as multi-user verification and enhanced content moderation tools.

Since [https://craftcms.com/blog/craft-33 the release of version 3.3] Craft has had a dedicated headless mode. That release also saw the introduction of an integrated [[GraphQL]] API, though it is currently (as of 2020) only accessible to paid license holders. For free license users, the first-party [https://plugins.craftcms.com/element-api Elements API] plugin offers an easy route to set up a RESTful JSON API.
