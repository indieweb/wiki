== Configuring Organization-Owned Repositories ==

If you're a GitHub admin or owner of an organization and are adding organization-owned repositories to Code Climate, you may have to do the following in order to have access to the repository's settings on Code Climate:

# Following the instructions [https://docs.codeclimate.com/v1.0/docs/approve-code-climate-as-a-third-party-application-in-github on this page], approve Code Climate as a third-party application in GitHub. This will grant Code Climate full access to your GitHub organization's repositories.
# Navigate to [https://codeclimate.com/oss/dashboard Code Climate's dashboard] and click "Add a repository."
# On the [https://codeclimate.com/github/repos/new Add public repositories from GitHub page], click "Sync now."
# Once syncing completes, click "Add Repo" next to any GitHub organization-owned repositories that you'd like to add to Code Climate. You may want to re-add previously-added GitHub organization-owned repositories in order to see Code Climate's settings page.

You should now be able to see Code Climate's settings page for GitHub organization-owned repositories (presuming you're an admin or owner of the organization).
