=== Aaron Parecki ===
* I have not yet set up aaronparecki.com with a CDN because I am uncertain about how it will deal with dynamic content such as my admin interface
* I use [[CloudFlare]] to serve the resized avatars when I show comments and likes. As of 2018-02-10, CloudFlare serves 73gb/month for me, 67gb/month of which is cached. As of 2018-12-01, it serves 95gb/month, 92gb/month of which is cached. This saves a lot of bandwidth on the servers where the avatars actually live.
* I set up [[CloudFlare]] for geoloqi.com because I wanted a zero-effort and zero-maintenance way to support https on an ongoing basis

"wordpress.com's photon CDN serves all of my photo album photos, eg https://snarfed.org/jackson-hole . did that mainly for speed on heavy pages with many high res photos." [https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-07-05/1467762813313000]

"I’m using Amazon’s Cloudfront on dateedge.com. I haven’t wired it up to my personal site yet since flipping over to Dark Matter proper." [https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-07-05/1467762833404000]
