==What Is A Canon Page?==

A /canon page (sometimes called a 'personal canon') is a list of books, articles, websites, media, and ideas that've influenced you.

==Why Create A Canon Page?==

* Provides a glimpse into your interests
* Creates a place for others to make discoveries
* Serves as a archive of meaningful influences

==How To Create A Canon Page==

===Gather Your Influences===

Start by reviewing existing lists you may have:
* Books you've read
* Favorite article, music, films, and other media
* Websites you regularly visit
* Ideas and concepts that changed your thinking

===Create Your List===

List everything that comes to mind as a potential influence. Narrow your selection to the most significant ones. 

Optionally, group them into categories. Like:

* By type: books, articles, websites, media, ideas
* By topic: your areas of interest or expertise
* By theme: concepts that connect ones
* Chronologically: when these entered your life
