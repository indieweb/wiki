'''<dfn>[https://contently.com/ Contently]</dfn>''' is a content marketing platform geared towards large publishers with a variety of web tools for content creation, marketing, and [[analytics]] as well as [[portfolio]] tools and a marketplace for freelance writers.

Their website indicates "freelancers matched with brands can pitch ideas, submit work, and instantly receive payment all in one place."


== Portfolios ==
=== Examples ===
* Freelance science writer and journalist [http://www.michaelcmarshall.com/ Michael Marshall] uses Contently (https://michaelmarshall.contently.com/) to aggregate his various [[articles]] across outlets to one location. His [[portfolio]] page allows editors and readers to filter his work by clients, topics, skills, and formats (Article / blog post, Infographic, Podcast, Whitepaper, etc.)


== Freelance Advice ==
The company also operates [https://contently.net/ The Freelancer] as a service geared toward the freelance space as a supplement to their paid service.


== Criticism ==
* Their portfolio pages don't have [[RSS]] or feeds indicating they're made solely for marketing purposes rather than consumption.
