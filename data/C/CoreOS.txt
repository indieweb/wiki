<dfn>[https://coreos.com/ CoreOS]</dfn> is a Linux distribution focused on large-scale deployments. Every application on a CoreOS system runs inside its own container, which lets packagers have very tight control over the environment their application will run in. 

By default CoreOS containers are automatically updated when a new release is made available, which allows a relatively small team of engineers employed by CoreOS to quickly deploy patches to an enormous number of servers.
