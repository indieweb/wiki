'''<dfn>Calypso</dfn>''' is the javascript-based rewrite of the [[wordpress]] admin interface. It's open sourced at https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso [https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/ described here]

== Criticisms ==

Even though the admin interface is not something the has to be [[curlable]], a JavaScript-only interface with no fallback is not a friendly solution for everyone.
