'''<dfn>[https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/ Calypso]</dfn>''' is the javascript-based rewrite of the [[WordPress]] admin interface for WordPress.com and [[JetPack]] enabled blogs. It relies on the WordPress.com REST API to communicate to the WordPress core. It provides desktop apps for Mac OS X (10.9+), Windows (7+), and Linux (.tar.gz)/Linux (.deb)

It's open sourced on [https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso Github].

== Criticisms ==
Even though the admin interface is not something the has to be [[curlable]], a JavaScript-only interface with no fallback is not a friendly solution for everyone.

It requires an account on WordPress.com with [[JetPack]] enabled.
