This page is for brainstorming about [[webactions]] verbs.

== Common Clusters ==
Common clusters of web actions:

* '''<code>post</code>''' - more specific than "share", more general than "comment", or "tweet"/"reply", though those might show up in a UI where a reader expected a Twitter-like experience
* '''<code>reply</code>''' - specifically to reply to the current URL. Twitter uses a different icon. IndieNews and Barnaby.co.uk both have reply actions.
* '''<code>repost</code>''' - generalization or Twitter's "retweet", Tumblr's "reblog" ("retumbl?"),  Pinterest "repin"
* '''<code>like</code>''' - generalization of Twitter "favorite", Facebook "like", GooglePlus "+1". Alternatively, could split this up into separate verbs for "favorite" and "like", or further specialize: "heart" (Instagram "like"), "star" (Flickr "favorite" and Twitter "favorite"). It's not clear which approach (general or specific) is better. People do assign different meanings to favoriting vs. liking. (there's a photo on flic.kr/tantek with a conversation about this but can't find it now)

== New Verbs ==
* '''<code>tip</code>''' - for [[Flattr]], [[Gittip]] buttons and maybe other [[payment]] providers.

== Other Sources ==
* The [http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/browse/#view=ViewFolder&param=Verbs Activitystreams verb registry] might be a good place to start/mine research from --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 00:49, 24 February 2013 (PST)
** The overlaps in verbs are misleading, and I ([[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]]) tend to think [[ActivityStreams]] is a ''bad'' starting point for web actions verbs for several reasons:
*** Activities are a much broader set of things that you've *done*. Things that you might do to a piece of content on one site across onto another site are a much smaller subset. Starting from "Activities" will likely be a dilutionary distraction.
*** There is very little clearly supportive research documentation for the verbs/object-types in the ActivityStreams registries (how did they come up with them? based on what features on what real world sites?). They tried to follow a microformats-like process but failed to document their work, so it looks like people just made things up (whether or not they did).
*** Most of the ActivityStreams objects types and verbs were proposed by people who never actually implemented them ([[dogfood]] fail), nevermind that they didn't implement them on their own sites ([[selfdogfood]] fail). Note the lack of anything more than minimal "examples in the wild" documentation on wiki.activitystrea.ms.
*** Similar and more issues are documented on the [[ActivityStreams#Issues|ActivityStreams page]].
** A much better place to start/mine research from would be to document the real world web actions that individual silos support (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Twitter]]) that other sites actually place on their content, or even better, that indieweb sites use on their content and generalize from there.
