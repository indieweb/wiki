'''<dfn>FitBit</dfn>''' is a hardware device and service for tracking [[exercise]], [[sleep]], and other physical activity.

Some FitBit devices contain a heart rate monitor that can record continuous heart rate throughout the day. The application shows a [[sparkline]] of your heart rate for each day, along with the average "resting bpm" rate.
