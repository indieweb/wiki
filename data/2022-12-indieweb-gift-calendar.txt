The 2022 '''<dfn>IndieWeb Gift Calendar</dfn>''' is the 6th annual group effort to gift (ship) one or  more IndieWeb-related thing(s) each day of December that others can use to improve their IndieWeb experience. 

This can be anything from major [[wikify|wiki documentation contributions / improvements]] to shipping updates on any of the IndieWeb applications (like [[social reader]]s), [[services]], [[CMS]]s, [[plugin]]s, [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], or any other projects in use by multiple folks. 

Welcome to the 6th annual '''IndieWeb Gift Calendar'''! Anyone can participate, and if you’re looking for ideas, see the '''[[#Inspiration|Inspiration section below]]'''. 
* See previous years for examples: '''[[2021-12-indieweb-gift-calendar|2021]], [[2020-12-indieweb-gift-calendar|2020]], [[2019-12-indieweb-gift-calendar|2019]], [[2018-12-indieweb-challenge|2018]],  [[2017-12-indieweb-challenge|2017]]'''

Please keep in mind the '''[[#Considerations|Considerations]]''' and if you’re not sure, you may want to first make a '''[[2023-01-01-commitments|commitment for yourself]]''' (and follow through) to ship something you’ll use on your own site, as it will likely help reveal ways to improve things for the community as a whole that others can also use.

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below!

__TOC__
== Considerations ==
Gifts can be anything from major [[wikify|wiki documentation contributions / improvements]] to shipping updates on any of the IndieWeb applications (like [[social reader]]s), [[services]], [[CMS]]s, [[plugin]]s, [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], or any other projects in use by multiple folks. 

Please keep in mind the following considerations when adding something to a day:
* It must be shipping / usable, not just a blog post announcing / saying you plan to do it.
* Is it clear what your thing does?
* Is it clear how someone is supposed to use it or otherwise benefit from it?
* What use-case does it solve for others (besides yourself)? Ask yourself, how would/could someone else in the community use the thing I'm posting? 
* If it's a markup / styling example, is it clear what its purpose is, and how someone could/should copy the markup/styling and customize it for their own site?
* If it's a programming example, is it clear how an indieweb site could use the code, using what language(s)? Does it require any frameworks?
* If it's a code example or project, is it clearly open sourced, with a clear link to its GitHub or other code repo that has at least a README explaining how it can be used for either direct user benefit or to enhance existing indieweb sites?

== Inspiration ==
Looking for something to do to benefit the community?

In general (feel free to add things here that you find inspiring in general, or hope someone else is inspired to do :)
* Updates to / new versions of '''[[2021-12-indieweb-gift-calendar|things shipped in last year’s calendar]]''' or prior gift calendars.
* '''[[to-do]]''' and look for something you can do in a day!
* [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues IndieWebify issues] to fix, fix one, and get an update deployed
* New release of [[microformats2]] parser(s)
** php-mf2
** ...
* Work on [[2022-review]] and previous years that weren't completed
* Organize and host a virtual IndieWeb [[event]]
* ...

Specific inspirations:

== In progress ==
Got something you're working on for the IndieWeb Gift Calendar but it's not quite complete or ready for community re-use? Feel free to link to it here while you're working on it, especially if you'd like others to review it, provide feedback etc.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Emoji gift kinds ===
Can we use emoji to indicate different kinds of gifts? E.g.
Used so far:
* 🖍 graphics posting/creating user client (presumably with [[Micropub]] support)
* 📄 new wiki page
* 📑 new category wiki page
* 🛠 IndieWeb [[tools]], libraries, command line utilities etc. for developers
* 📜 blog post about the IndieWeb
Ideas (inspired by kinds of gifts from 2021)
* 📫 IndieWeb related [[newsletter]] published, e.g. [[This Week In The IndieWeb]]
* 📅 IndieWeb related event
* ❇️ new IndieWeb related user service
* ✳️ updated IndieWeb related user service
* 🧩 IndieWeb related plugin e.g. WordPress plugin
* 💬 IndieWeb chat related improvements (bots, chat bridges, moderation, archives)
More ideas (for other kinds of gifts it would be great to see!)
* 📝 writing client (presumably with [[Micropub]] support)
* ...

More sources of ideas:
* See [[posts#Types_of_Posts]]
