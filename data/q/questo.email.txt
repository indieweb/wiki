'''<dfn>[http://questo.email/ questo.email]</dfn>''' was an email-to-webmention bridge that was live from December 2014 through December 2015. [https://github.com/fiatjaf/questo.email/blob/b86739ae0421312da03dfd92f1fb0c6595b25f7f/README.md] The code is available at: https://github.com/fiatjaf/questo.email.

== How to use ==
If you're using it from the indieweb side (your own site), it supports mentioning and messaging people by email, just like a webmention to the home page, but to an email instead (you just have to send the webmention to '''<code>name.mailprovider.com.questo.email</code>''').

If you're using it from the email side (your own email messages), it does webmentions in reply to posts (at '''<code>webmention@questo.email</code>''' and the URL in the Subject) and webmentions to the home page ([[messaging]]) (at '''<code>target-domain@questo.email</code>'''). It also supports basic publishing at '''<code>post@questo.email</code>''' (like a webmention, but not targeted at anyone, yet content will be live on the web -- this kind of post also sends webmentions to any referred URL).
