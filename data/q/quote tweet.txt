A '''<dfn>quote tweet</dfn>''' (also known as a "<dfn>retweet with comment</dfn>") is a [[reply]] on [[Twitter]] to an original tweet that displays the entirety of the original in a [[reply-context]] below the reply text.

Quote tweet is available in the Twitter UI as an option inside their "retweet" button.[https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169873]

== Examples ==
With reply text commentary:

== Backfeeding ==
If someone posts a quote tweet in response to a [[POSSE]] tweet copy of one of your posts, it makes sense to [[backfeed]] it to your original like any other @-reply tweet.

=== Bridgy support ===
[[Bridgy]] does support backfeeding quoted tweets. Add your examples / opinions to the feature request:
