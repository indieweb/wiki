How should we best quote one indieweb post in another? (e.g. across blogs)

** 'note' broadcast display guidelines - a generic indie web version of [https://support.twitter.com/entries/114233 Tweet broadcast display guidelines]
** brainstorm equivalent such guidelines for other post types, 'article', etc.
* figure out how an indie web site should link to those (from their about page? help page?) to encourage and establish a best practices culture of how to quote/cite/rebroadcast IndieWeb posts/content
* document examples of indie web sites with such documentation about how to best display their content on other sites (next section: IndieWeb Display Guidelines)
