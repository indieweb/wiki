{{stub}}

'''<dfn>question</dfn>''' is a post type for soliciting [[answer]] replies, which are then typically up/down voted by others and then displayed underneath the question post ordered by highest positive vote count rather than time ordered.

== Why ==
You would publish a question post in order to both get answers to your question, and get others to vote on the answers in order to collectively sort them by best to worst answer.

== How ==
The markup for publishing a question post is not yet defined, yet you can start with just a normal [[h-entry]], like that for a [[note]] post.

=== {{JackyAlcine}}'s Approach ===
On June 17, 2019; {{JackyAlcine}} proposed [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/177 markup] for open-ended and multiple choice questions.

Multiple choice:

<pre>
<section class="h-entry">
<p class="p-note">How do you feel about my site's new theme?</p>
<ol>
  <li class="p-choice">Not that great.</li>
  <li class="p-choice">I'm undecided.</li>
  <li class="p-choice">I'll make it work.</li>
</ol>
</section>
</pre>

Open Ended:

<pre>
<section class="h-entry">
<p class="p-note">How do you feel about my site's new theme?</p>
<span class="p-choice"></span>
</section>
</pre>

Answer Markup:

<pre>
<section class="h-entry u-in-reply-to">
  "<span class="p-choice">I'm undecided.</span>" is how
  I answered <a href="URL" class="u-url">the question</a>.
</section>
</pre>

{{capjamesg}} phrased a question in a blog post then allowed readers to vote on an answer by using a Webmention. He did not use any special markup to make it as easy as possible to test asking a question that supported answers from readers. More information is provided in the "IndieWeb Examples" section below.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} started a poll on his blog on May 17, 2022. The poll asked how much coffee his readers drank. To vote, readers must submit a Webmention to the URL with the option for which they want to vote. James plans to aggregate the results manually and share them on his blog while considering different ways to automate the process.

* The poll: https://jamesg.blog/2022/05/17/coffee-frequency/

== Brainstorming ==

* How should one ensure that the same domain does not send multiple Webmentions to try and manipulate the outcome of a question (assuming Webmentions are used for the polling logic)?

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Quora]]
* [[StackOverflow]]
* [[Twitter poll]]
