{{stub}}

'''<dfn>question</dfn>''' is a post type for soliciting [[answer]] replies, which are then typically up/down voted by others and then displayed underneath the question post ordered by highest positive vote count rather than time ordered.

== Why ==
You would publish a question post in order to both get answers to your question, and get others to vote on the answers in order to collectively sort them by best to worst answer.

== How ==
The markup for publishing a question post is not yet defined, yet you can start with just a normal [[h-entry]], like that for a [[note]] post.

On June 17, 2019; {{JackyAlcine}} proposed [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/177 markup] for open-ended and multiple choice questions.
