{{stub}}

'''<dfn>question</dfn>''' is a post type for soliciting [[answer]] replies, which are then typically up/down voted by others and then displayed underneath the question post ordered by highest positive vote count rather than time ordered.

== Why ==
You would publish a question post in order to both get answers to your question, and get others to vote on the answers in order to collectively sort them by best to worst answer.

== How ==
The markup for publishing a question post is not yet defined, yet you can start with just a normal [[h-entry]], like that for a [[note]] post.

=== {{JackyAlcine}}'s Approach ===
On June 17, 2019; {{JackyAlcine}} proposed [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/177 markup] for open-ended and multiple choice questions.

Multiple choice:

<pre>
<section class="h-entry">
<p class="p-note">How do you feel about my site's new theme?</p>
<ol>
  <li class="p-choice">Not that great.</li>
  <li class="p-choice">I'm undecided.</li>
  <li class="p-choice">I'll make it work.</li>
</ol>
</section>
</pre>

Open Ended:

<pre>
<section class="h-entry">
<p class="p-note">How do you feel about my site's new theme?</p>
<span class="p-choice"></span>
</section>
</pre>

Answer Markup:

<pre>
<section class="h-entry u-in-reply-to">
  "<span class="p-choice">I'm undecided.</span>" is how
  I answered <a href="URL" class="u-url">the question</a>.
</section>
</pre>
