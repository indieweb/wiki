'''A <dfn>queue</dfn>''' is a method used to distribute work across machines or threads by defining a FIFO queue of work to be done.

== Queue Systems ==
* [[Amazon Simple Queue Service]]
* [[Celery]] (in the Python world)
** easy to use, but quite large.
** can use Redis or RabbitMQ as the backend
* [http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/ beanstalkd] – lightweight protocol based on memcached [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-03-26/line/1395898812]
* [http://gearman.org/ gearman] – historically been fairly commonly used in the PHP community
* Google App Engine [https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/ Task Queue]
* [[PostgreSQL]] – supports pub-sub broadcasting through [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-listen.html LISTEN]/[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html NOTIFY]
* [[RabbitMQ]]
** Highly scalable message queue system written in Erlang
** Implements the AMQP standard.
** Supports broadcasting as well as 1-to-1 messaging etc.
* [[Redis]] – a general key-value store that can store various data structures, including a FIFO queue.
* uWSGI spooler
** part of uWSGI
** Simple file-based spool, similar in concept to mail spools
** Processes 1 task every n-seconds, which means there is an unnecessary lag between queueing and processing. Probably more suitable for large background tasks.
** lacking documentation

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb users using this approach
* {{aaronpk}} likes beanstalk, uses it in [[p3k]]  
* {{kylewm}} uses [[Redis]] with [http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/73/ this Python/Flask snippet], lightly modified.
** uwsgi spooler previously, polling every 30 seconds. It was simple and solid, but I didn't like that mentions weren't sent out right away, nor incoming mentions processed right away. Also no obvious way to query queued tasks for their status.
* {{voxpelli}} uses [[PostgreSQL]] Pubsub in [[webmention.herokuapp.com]] as described in [http://voxpelli.com/2015/01/pubsub-with-postgres-and-node-js/ this blog post].
* {{bear}} uses [[Redis]] PubSub to deliver events and a list to implement a FIFO queue.

== Alternatives ==
* Make an entry somewhere for the task and then have a [[cron]] do it. You could also use a [http://www.sitepoint.com/web-bugs-for-job-scheduling-hack-or-solution/ web bug].

== Queues and Brokers ==

Many message queues are also message brokers as they have to translate the incoming messages into other formats or protocols to allow the clients/consumers to receive them. [[RabbitMQ]] is a very common example of a Message Broker that is often called a Queueing System. At it's core RabbitMQ implements [[AMQP]] and then has quite a few delivery and filtering methods that enable consumers to receive messages.

Another example of a broker that has queue like behaviour is [[Google PubSub]]. This [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker Wikipedia page on brokers] has quite a good definition of the differences.
