A quantum website is a website that uses quantum computing or quantum information science to provide services or information. Quantum computing is a field of computer science that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations and operations that are impossible or impractical for classical computers. Quantum information science is a broader field that studies the nature and manipulation of quantum information, which is encoded in quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in superpositions of two states, such as 0 and 1, and can be entangled with other qubits, creating correlations that are stronger than classical ones.

Some examples of quantum websites are:

* [https://www.Quantum.gov Quantum.gov]<sup>1</sup>, the home of the National Quantum Initiative and its ongoing activities to explore and promote Quantum Information Science in the United States. This website provides information about the federal strategy, funding opportunities, research reports, and news related to quantum science and technology¹.

* [https://www.quantum.com/ Quantum.com]<sup>2</sup>, the website of Quantum Corporation, a company that provides data storage and management solutions that use artificial intelligence to enrich, protect, and archive unstructured data across the entire lifecycle. This website showcases the products, services, and use cases of Quantum Corporation in various industries and domains².

* [https://quantum.microsoft.com/ Azure Quantum]<sup>3</sup>, the website of Microsoft's cloud-based quantum computing platform that offers access to diverse quantum hardware, software, and solutions from Microsoft and its partners. This website allows users to learn, build, and run quantum applications using Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit and Q# programming language³.
