== Using an IRC client ==
If you're already and IRC user, setup your client with:
* Channel: #indiewebcamp
* Server: irc.freenode.net
* Port: 6667 (usually default)

== What is IRC ==
'''<dfn>Internet Relay Chat</dfn>''' (abbreviated <dfn><abbr>IRC</abbr></dfn>), in particular the #indiewebcamp channel on the irc.freenode.net server, is the primary community discussion forum for IndieWebCamp and anything about the IndieWeb.

== People on IRC ==
{{main|IRC-people}}

See our [[IRC-people|list of IRC regulars]] and their normal timezones.

The channel has regular administrators, who are also wiki administrators. If you want to get their attention, just say "adminhelp".

== Voice ==
''Upcoming feature''

Anyone who has added themselves to the [[IRC-people]] list and is also [[#Creating_a_registered_nickname|registered with Nickserv]] will be automatically given "voice" (+v) in the #indiewebcamp channel by [[Loqi]] as a way to indicate that you have access and are listed in the wiki.  This "user mode" is often represented by a + in front of the persons name in many IRC clients.  

Note, "voice" has nothing to do with who can/can't talk.  Everyone abiding by the [[Code-Of-Conduct]] is free to speak their (on topic) mind.  Want voice too?  Feel free to add yourself to [[irc-people]] or ask for help.

== Install an IRC app ==
You can use an IRC application for more convenience. Here are clients commonly used in the community which you can download and install:<br/>
MacOS: 
* [http://colloquy.info/ Colloquy] — open source (free on Mac)
* [http://limechat.net/mac/ Limechat] — open source (free on Mac)
Linux or Windows:
* [http://hexchat.github.io/ Hexchat]
iOS: 
* [http://colloquy.mobi/ Colloquy for iOS] — nominal fee.
* [http://limechat.net/iphone/ Limechat for iOS] — nominal fee.
Android:
* [https://market.android.com/details?id=org.yaaic&feature=search_result Yaaic on Android] — usually works fine. occasional crashes.
* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androirc AndroIRC] — [[User:willnorris.com]] reports moderate success.
Set up your client application to join:
* irc://irc.freenode.net/indiewebcamp
* Server: irc.freenode.net
* Port: 6667
* Channel: #indiewebcamp

IRC applications are convenient for automatically reconnecting you to the discussion channel, with your chosen nickname, and offer more configuration and alerting options than the web interface.

== Freenode Services ==
The indiewebcamp IRC channel is hosted on the freenode.net server.  See [[#Joining_a_server_and_channel|Joining a server and channel]] for info about configuring additional services (authenticated nicknames, etc.).

Use a browser to quickly join the live discussion chat using the freenode webchat:
* '''[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=indiewebcamp&nick=indie-visitor webchat #indiewebcamp discussion]'''

== Activity ==
Anecdotally the channel seems quite active:
* 08:00-10:00 Pacific Time (-0800/-0700)
** 16:00-18:00 UK Time (+0000/+0100)
** 17:00-19:00 EU Time (+0100/+0200)

==Bots on IRC==
The IRC channel uses this bot:

* [http://aaronparecki.com/Loqi Loqi] -  Contact: [[User:Aaronpk|aaronpk]]
** logs all edits to this wiki
** logs the irc channel itself to archives on the web
** logs Twitter mentions of #indieweb or #indiewebcamp to the channel
** logs [[webmentions]] of wiki pages

== Getting started with IRC ==
'''Please note:''' These directions relate specifically to the services that [http://freenode.net/ Freenode] offers.  Other IRC servers may differ with the services they offer and how to operate them.  

===Joining a server and channel===
Most clients will offer you a connection dialogue showing the required fields for connection. The details to connect to the server are:

*Server: <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
*Port: <code>6667</code> (usually default)

You should also fill in any fields to set your alias, real name and email address.  If available, save these settings for later to speed up connecting in future.

More on setting a password protected alias can be [[#Creating_a_registered_nickname|read here]].

Once connected, you will most likely be presented with the "MOTD" (message of the day). For the first visit, it is advisable to read this to find out about the server's policies and other important pieces of news and help, otherwise it can be ignored and you can either [[#Creating_a_registered_nickname|authenticate your alias]] or join a channel.

Your client may display to you a listing of all available channels.  Locate <code>#indiewebcamp</code> and select to join, or type <code>'''/join #indiewebcamp'''</code> into the command line available to you in your client (where you've just been shown your connection).

Assuming you've connected correctly, you should now find youself in the indiewebcamp channel!

More detailed, but general, advice can be [http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html#intro read here].

===Creating a registered nickname===
Registration means that a password becomes associated with your alias/nickname/sign-in name and from the point of registration authorisation is required to communicate using that alias.

Registration of a nickname is required for some channels, and should be done to protect your identity.

To register with [http://freenode.net Freenode], you must communicate with their service known as NickServ.  The two basic command you will need to get started are:

For registration: <code>/msg nickserv register ''password'' ''email''</code>

For authentication (login): <code>/msg nickserv identify ''password''</code>

With <code>''password''</code> being a value of your choice and <code>''email''</code> being the email a verification command is send to. 

The command looks something like <code>/msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER ''yournick'' mbarbwytaspq</code>. Enter this command to verify your email with the nickserv.

Your client may offer you an option to set your alias and password, so that you will not have to manually enter this information on each join.  Refer to your client's help files for more on this.

These commands can be typed directly into the server window upon join, or whilst in a channel, just as you would normally send a message.

More detailed user registration command information can be found in [http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#userregistration Freenode's FAQ]

=== Requiring nickname authentication ===
You can set an option requiring authentication of your nickname within 30 seconds. If not authenticated in that time, the nickname will automatically be changed.

Once authenticated to [[Nickserv]],

<code>/msg NickServ SET ENFORCE ON</code>

===Communicating===
Sending a message to a channel may be as simple as joining the channel and typing into the window, just as you would with an Instant Messenger. You can refer to your client's help files for quicker/alternative methods of doing the following. For all clients the following commands are available (the parts in bold must be used, but are not seen by others):

'''Sending a message to the entire channel you are currently in:'''

Command: <kbd>'''/msg''' Hello world!</kbd>

Result: <samp><Bill> Hello world!</samp>

'''Sending an action/emotive/3rd person statement:'''

Command: <kbd>'''/me''' dances a code jig</kbd>

Result: <samp>Bill dances a code jig</samp>

'''Sending a message to one person only (private chat):'''

Command: <kbd>'''/msg Bob''' Hi, would you like to code jig?</kbd>

Result (for Bob only): <samp><Bill> Hi, would you like to code jig?</samp>

For example, <kbd>/whois rascul</kbd>

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Need to identify via SASL ===
If you get an error message like:
<pre>*** Notice -- You need to identify via SASL to use this server</pre>
Then:
* If you're on '''Colloquy on Mac''', there are two possible fixes in increasing difficulty:
** [http://readystate4.com/2011/02/25/solution-to-sasl-error-while-joining-irc-from-a-tethered-mobile-device-notice-you-need-to-identify-via-sasl-to-use-this-server/ setup a SOCKS proxy], or:
** download the [http://www.luisdelarosa.com/2011/04/28/fixing-sasl-for-colloquy-when-you-are-using-a-mifi/ latest Colloquy source and build it yourself] (which supposedly has SASL support, but there's been no official Colloquy release since the the support was added)
*** ... except Colloquy 2.4.1, released 2013-20-23 still has this problem.
* If you're on '''Colloquy on iOS''', you need to configure the SASL support in the Advanced options.
** (stub - need more description here about how to find the Advanced options and what to enter, screenshots would be nice)

Scenarios - the above error has been encountered when:
* Using a Virgin Mobile MiFi to access the internet. (2011-193 [[User:Tantek|Tantek]])
* Using a tethered T-Mobile Internet connection ([[User:Npdoty.name|Npdoty.name]] 15:47, 14 March 2013 (PDT))
