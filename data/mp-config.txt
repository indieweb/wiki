{{stub}}

'''<dfn>mp-config</dfn>''' is a method of using a query to a [[micropub]] endpoint to allow you indie website to discover user support for [[webactions]].

= Detail =

mp-config provides a server-side alternative to [[indie-config]] for discovering the user's action handler URLs. This method does not require a JavaScript or a custom schema handler to be registered in the browser, but it does require the user to support micropub and be signed in on the site they are browsing. 

Along the same lines as [[micropub#Discovering_Supported_Syndication_Targets]], external sites could query the micropub endpoint for a list of action handler URLs.

1. Aaron signs in to Barnaby's site with the "config" scope.

2. Barnaby's site issues a GET request to Aaron's micropub endpoint, which replies with a url-encoded list of actions and their associated handler URL

<code><pre>
GET /micropub_endpoint?q=actions
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxx

reply=http://aaron.com/reply?u={url}&repost=http://aaron.com/repost?u={url}
</pre></code>

3. When Barnaby renders indie-action elements, he substitutes Aaron's configured action handlers for Twitter intent URLs or whatever fallback he would normally use.

= IndieWeb Examples =

* {{kylewm}} Supports mp-config on https://kylewm.com as of 2014-10-19. When a micropub-enabled user signs in, kylewm.com will use their /micropub?q=config endpoint to determine web action handlers, that are used in place of Reply/Repost/Like indie-actions on each post permalink page.

* {{benthatmustbeme}} Supports mp-config on ben.thatmustbe.me as of 2014-10-20.  This will add Like, Reply, Repost, and Bookmark actions if available.  It will also offer Edit and Delete on any post comments owned by the user.

= Brainstorming =

== Response format ==

Micropub in general uses application/x-www-urlencoded to pass information back and forth. Some implementers prefer to return action -> URLs as a JSON object. {{kylewm}} will currently handle either one based on the value of the Content-Type header.

== Authorization not needed to get list ==

There is no real secure information given in the list of endpoints.  In fact you want this to be as readily available as possible.  As such I think the Auth header on the request to q=actions should be dropped.  - {{benthatmustbeme}}

* I tend to agree. The only reason I can think of that a micropub access-token might be necessary is if someone has "secret" admin URLs (i.e. instead of a real authorization mechanism). Does anyone do this? If so, do we care about supporting it? [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 21:43, 20 October 2014 (PDT)
** If authorization isn't necessary, it makes me wonder if this isn't really micropub at all. A <code>&lt;link rel="indie_config"></code> would work just as well and would be a much lower bar for most sites to implement [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 21:43, 20 October 2014 (PDT)

== Micropub endpoint as indie-config page ==

Rather than have a separate config for indie config {{benthatmustbeme}} queries ?q=indie-config to pull up configs formatted for use with [indie-config]

== Micropub configuring of list ==

In order to modify the list and allow different micropub clients to act for different actions, we could add some ability for a micropub client (when given "config" scope) to offer itself as a new client for an action.  so it submits ?q=config&action="reply"&url="microedit.com/reply?url={url}"
