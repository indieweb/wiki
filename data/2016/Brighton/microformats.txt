== Notes ==
Introduction:
* h-card is vCard in HTML
* microformats2 in general
* simple microformats2 examples
* implied properties: name, url, photo
    
Show simple h-card markup, and JSON via pin13.net
Also h-entry for posts, comments, federated commenting

Demonstrate woodwind.xyz subscribing to an h-feed
show subscribing to an h-feed (tantek.com)
demo how posting on tantek.com causes a PuSH update that seconds later shows "1 New Post" on the woodwind.xyz screen
clicking that "1 New Post" shows the new post on tantek.com

try converting tantek.com to Atom via Granary
noted that it worked for the entries and entry-content but no author
why no author? looked into it. no author on h-entry or h-feed, but rel=author on page. perhaps granary does not support /authorship algorithm rel=author.

Show indiewebify.me for checking your IndieWeb microformats
