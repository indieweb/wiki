Description: 

== Participants ==

== Notes ==
* interests and whys
** longetivity
** adactio want to combine database relation usage with longetivity
** resiliency
** option to use CDNs - geo-distribution
** any end-user-friendly SaaS solution for static generators?
*** webfaction ?
** security - there's nothing to hack
** most personal sites receive infrequent updates; no need for always-on dynamicity

* webmentions for static sites
** 3rd party or hosted "dynamic" part is necessary
*** receive  webmentions
*** interact with other sites
** potential hybrid solution:
*** on build, pull the existing mentions/comments
*** plus pull the not yet baked in ones via JS

* currently used sw
** jekyll

* large binary content issue
** static sites text can go into version control repositories, but pushing eg. photos is a problem
** the text and the binary can be separated and upload with commit hooks, for example

* how do you transition from a dynamic site to a static content
** Wordpress to Jekyll exporter: https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter
** spiders to go throught the site
*** generate transitions (static content) on the fly
*** try to lookup this intermediate static file and only go to the DB if this fails
*** once done, switch to complete static genetor?

* storage formats
** Markdown
*** problems with raw Markdown documents:
**** not enough metadata
**** no relation storage
*** solutions:
**** frontmatter (YAML)
**** intermediate database with metadata
** h-entry (HTML)
*** benefits of included metadata
** aaronpk is using YAML version of the h-entry data as frontmatter in front of the content
