== Notes ==
* what do people use bookmarks for?

=== adactio ===
* i bookmark for my future self. "oh, I read something about that" and can look it up later
* had used third parties like magnolia, delicious
* current workflow: generally on laptop, has a bookmarklet to create the bookmark
* components of a bookmark: name, url, tags, block quote, own text/commentary
* display: has a whitelist of providers to auto-embed things like flickr galleries
* all bookmarks are public (because everything is public)
* syndicates to @adactiolinks on twitter

Question:
* do links in feed etc go to bookmark target or post about the link (when commentary added). Adactio got feedback that users don't want to click twice

* sends webmentions for bookmarks
* wants to ping web archive to tell them to save a copy
    
=== sebastian greger ===

* wants to share with his readers *why* he's bookmarking something
* posts via a bookmarklet
* has some on twitter https://twitter.com/sebastiangreger with both styles
* syndicated tweet bookmarks include title, author's @-name, commentary, link to original article or link to both (still undecided what is the right format)
* all bookmark posts are private, only some of them are made public and that is when he adds commentary

=== aaronpk ===
* posts with screenshot (wkhtmltopdf)
* often posts with pull quotes
* tags on bookmark posts link to a composite feed of all posts on my site tagged X https://aaronparecki.com/tag/indieweb
* also provide a URL like https://aaronparecki.com/bookmarks?tag=indieweb

=== cweiske ===
* hosts a semanticscuttle instance on home server, not accessible for the public, http://semanticscuttle.sourceforge.net/
* posting of bookmarks done via xmpp chat (url + hashtags), http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/php-xmpp-bot.htm
* shows screenshots for urls via phancap http://cweiske.de/phancap.htm
** you can try phancap live at http://phancap.cweiske.de/phancap.phar/

== bookmark vs read-it-later ==
* mixed use: some bookmark to read later, others only what they read, others don't care
* common use of tags to indicate whether something is for reading later or read

== storing sites vs bookmarking ==
* external archiving: http://indieweb.org/archival_copy
* idea: could ping archive.org when bookmarking, so a copy is created (remember donation to archive.org)
* www.wallabag.org looks interesting - self hosted open source  pocket/instapaper type thing

== bookmark vs. like vs. reply ==
* bookmarks are not necessarily replies, as they are not directed to the original author but to the readers of the person bookmarking
* bookmarks are not always "likes", because one may also publish bookmarks to sites one does not agree with
* see indieweb.org/bookmark -> specific markup and microformats for bookmark posts

=== alpower ===
* I don't bookmark indieweb fashion (yet) but use https://pinboard.in/u:alpower as it allows me 
* to auto bookmark links in tweets, and retrieve them using tags on the pinboard url.
