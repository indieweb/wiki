'''<dfn>What can Webmention learn from Email</dfn>''' was a session at [[2016/Brighton|IndieWebCamp Brighton 2016]].

== Participants ==
* aaronpk
* petermolnar

== Notes ==
outline:
* document what email has done, and what is fundamentally happening
* how can we apply that to webmention

=== what email has done ===
* text analysis - bayesian filtering, etc, actually looking at the contents of the message to decide whether it's spam
* blacklisting - blacklisting IP addresses of senders
* greylisting - temporary reject, allow a retry to succeed
* trust database - slowly allow a larger volume of email per sender depending on how many have been successfully delivered
* no known open source solutions
* SPF - these servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of this domain
* DKIM
"an email authentication method designed to detect email spoofing. It allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain." 
* full public key is in the DNS record of the sender domain, so that the receiver can verify the received message against the public key
* DMARC - sender publishes rules on how messages from it should be verified using SPF and DKIM
* rules can contain actions (reject, notify, report)
* can provide a hook back so the receiver can report spam it got to the place the spam reported to be from

agari.com - collects DMARC reports and creates a blacklist from it

=== what problems with webmention are we trying to address ===
* amplification attack
* find 100 websites that support receiving webmention
* send a webmention to all of them with the source URL of your victim
* victim is overwhelmed with requests
* 

=== third parties handling webmentions ===
* having a third party receive your webmentions is no problem
* having a third party sending webmentions for you has the same problem as email
* how can a domain publish a list of trusted senders so that receivers know whether the sender IP is expected?


=== how can this apply to webmention ===
* text analysis
* akismet is doing this
* blacklisting 



==== SPF is explicitly for this use case ====
* we could take SPF as it is written and use it for webmention
* is there any value in doing this, because webmention itself provides verification in the HTTP lookup?
* yes there is, because this can help mitigate the amplification attack - tells the receiver whether or not to bother fetching the source URL

prevents a receiver from fetching the source URL by first looking up whether the webmention request IP is allowed to send webmentions for the source domain


==== DKIM ====
* if two people are using the same webmention sending service (e.g. telegraph.p3k.io), then it's possible for attacker A to forge a webmention request from victim B, and have the SPF check still pass
* DKIM mitigates the risk of bypassing the SPF check
* however, webmention already prevents this attack from generating an actual webmention, since the receiver is going to fetch the source URL over HTTP, and the attacker can't make a web page on the victim's server anyway
* therefore DKIM provides no additional value to webmention
* the only thing we lose by not implementing DKIM (or DKIM-like things) is that we remove the amplification attack protection for the case where two people share a webmention sending service
* might be a good idea to revisit this if a large-scale sender (like wordpress.com, amazon aws, etc) starts sending webmention

is signing the webmention payload useful?
* provides the ability to sign the webmention request (source & target) without needing to look at the post
* a third party service can send signed webmentions without needing to see the contents of the post (works with private posts)
* using the third party's private key

DKIM itself is too specific to email, but some other signing mechanism could work

there is less overhead involved in making a DNS request compared to an HTTP request
* you can send a gzip bomb in HTTP but you can't in DNS


==== DMARC ====
* reverse hook in DMARC is useful
* collect reports about bad actors

in webmention terms:
* when the receiver gets a forged webmention from source A (didn't pass SPF or DKIM), looks up the DMARC record of domain A
* sends a web hook with a report of the invalid webmention
