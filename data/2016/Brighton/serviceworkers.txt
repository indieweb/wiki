Session: service worker use cases

== Participants ==
* Jeremy Keith
* Glenn Jones
* Andrea Rota
* Sven Knebel
* Sebastian Lasse
* Martin Tomes
* Erik Erskine

== Notes ==
* basics: can intercept and handle failures for HTTP access to resources on a page
* require HTTPS
* installed via JS

adactio:
* caches index pages -> offline readable

no magic, everything has to (but can be) implemented as desired using relevant APIs:
* Cache API (intercept requests, store/fetch results to/from cache)
* BackgroundSync API allows to schedule requests for later https://github.com/WICG/BackgroundSync/blob/master/explainer.md
* notifications API  (also allows notifications when the browser is closed)
* postMessage API (send message between tabs and service worker)

use cases (easy -> complex):
# cache assets
# custom offline page
# cache first, then update
# network first -> start timer, if network to slow use cache
# allow user to store individual sites in local cache (e.g. read later)
# cached shell available: service worker can mark requests and only fetch partials and build them together
