* ... add yourself

== Notes ==
Other ways to show posts other than time-ordered feeds
=== Summary ===
* last post in several categories
* most minimal: just your most recent post (glennjones) at the top
=== Linear ===
* grouped by category
* list of things found by related tags/content
* "algorithm" time-ish ordered subset. some items from the recent past.
=== Linear Clustered ===
* calendar view, e.g. aaronpk's year achives: aaronpk.com/2016
=== Two Dimensional ===
* on a map

=== axes ===
* time - stream, calendar, streamgraph, sparklines
* location - maps, streamgraph
* content - show related posts, group by subject of photo, tag cloud, pinned post, highlighted select few posts, popularity

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== adactio ===
everything shows up in main stream

=== aaronpk ===
* home page is some automatic filtering of post types, but any post can be promoted to the home page manually
* shows the last sleep, last food, last photo, and next event
* https://aaronparecki.com/2016 and https://aaronparecki.com/2016/09 - calendar style view of posts


=== tantek ===
* I don't want to mess with the timeline so I don't include the future on my home page
* future-dated posts do not appear on the home page, but can be seen at their URL and can be navigated to with the "next" button


=== sgreger ===
* sidebar is algorithmically curated (never have more than 3 bookmarks) 
* intent is the stream on the left is related to the permalink being viewed

=== glenn ===
*displays only the last post on the home page
*a very strong entrance
*if the latest post is an article, it does not show up here

== Silo Examples ==
=== flickr ===
* time-ordered both by photo taken and photo uploaded
* grouped by category/content "magic view"
* map view

== Brainstorming ==
=== is time the ultimately best solution to organize a site ===
*most indieweb sites are organized along a time line
*historically, indieweb has been looking at the silos and recreating the experience
*but more and more silos are moving away from chiefly timeline (though still mostly based on time)
*alternative approach: organizing by content topics
*one of the challenges of indieweb sites compared to silos is that we do not know our audience (no "following" feature)
*idea: recreate the silo experience by e.g. creating a cookie and offering on next visit primarily what the user consumed last time
*risk of a filter bubble, but could be made visible in the UI
*adactio: "the problem is not the filter bubble, it's that it is opaque"
*aaronpk: the issue might be best solved by a reader?
*could it be some interactive element 

=== other relevant notions ===
there are also other ways to push relevant posts to readers (re: glenn's "last post only" approach
* [[pinned]] posts
* "my most popular posts"
* "on this day last year"
* filter bubble reversed: randomness

== other non-linear ideas ==
* streamgraph: http://benjaminbenben.com/2012/11/04/lastfm-canvas-streamgraph/
* http://feltron.com/2014
* tag - location correlance ( which tags are common in which locations )

=== other notes ===

=== readers ===
aaronpk: As a vegetarian, I don't want to see all of adactio's photos of fish, but I do want to see his other photos

Woodwind.xyz is a reader

tantek: I want to build the notebook from Adjustment Bureau as my reader:
* http://tantek.com/2011/087/t5/future-probability-tree-adjustment-forking-paths

(x-axis is time, y-axis represents packed location using various algorithms; the length of the lines in y-direction represent the distance traveled?)
