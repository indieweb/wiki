Kurtis
* has been using [[Known]], but it does not have a built-in Reader
* How do I mimic the way I interact with Twitter but in an indieweb environment

[[Woodwind]] in an indieweb reader

Known just pushed an update, which allows you to log in to Woodwind with your URL and your own password
* the old way was using rel=me and a twitter login

KevinMarks demoing Woodwind
* finds a post in the reader
* clicks repost, and syndicates the repost to Twitter
* finds another post, writes a reply. posted to Known and also on Twitter

Aaron
* built [[Monocle]], a reader very similar to Woodwind, then found myself not using it regularly
* shared summary of https://aaronparecki.com/2015/08/29/8/why-i-live-in-irc post

Cassie
* mostly reads twitter home timeline
* follows 1100-ish people

mlncn
* wants a toggle at authorship time, to indicate the post's relative importance

some discussion about automatically finding the relative importance of a post

topic-based aggregators like news.indiewebcamp.com

Dmitri: Using an RSS/Atom reader
* then going through ridiculous lengths to make Atom feeds from things like Facebook feeds
* using things like [[IFTTT]]

Tantek:
* old-style RSS readers are dead, if the reader can't interact with the post directly
* stopped using Twitter because it's noisy and mostly now third-person content
* twitter used to be "what are you doing right now" so the content was high qualtiy and empathetic
* now it is 99% people posting links to other peoples' stuff and is disconnected
* Kurtis: do you feel the method you're using now gets closer to the first-person content?
* Tantek: instagram still has that feel. 99% of the posts are from the person taking the picture
** news portals are an absolute disaster, 99% showing "world is ending" type posts
** this is bad for you: http://tantek.com/2016/042/t1/the-problem-to-solve-negative-news
