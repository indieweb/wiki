{{kylewm}} used to have [[invitation]] posts (with [[Redwind]]) but he switched to Known which does not yet support them.


Challenges:
* [[UI]] for creating events - aaronpk
* Needs a UI for quickly creating events - aaronpk
* having to enter name of the place, address, and latlong

Facebook examples of events:
* [[event#Facebook]]
* [[related_events#Facebook]]


Authoring events, priority of [[location]] information
* name of location
* or @-name of location, e.g. @MozSF, which links to its wiki page, which then has an [[h-card]] with address information
* URL
* Location - as a string, since you can copy/paste into a maps app, or location can be a virtual location
...when?

What does Known support for event creating?

What about cloning an existing event to make a new event?
* calagator.org supports cloning events
* Facebook has "Copy Event" in the "..." pop-up on an event permalink.

Invitation posts are interesting, but until we have more people accepting (and responding to?) homepage webmentions, they're not very useful.


Interesting Event display aspect of Facebook events: they show who *you know* is going, before everyone else
* Indie event would have to access your friends list to see "who you know"
* reading the event through a reader, the reader could have access to your friends list (since you [[indieauth]]'d in) and thus show RSVPs of people you know before other RSVPs

What about the comment thread on events? (e.g. on Facebook)
* Facebook's deprioritization of the "Not going" button has made people [[reply]] "I am not going."
* Comments have been useful for:
** clarifications: can I bring kids? is there going to be food?
** Posting [[photo]]s of the event after the fact!
** creates a virtual group among the people who went or were invited
** aaronpk has a photobooth setup that posts photos directly to the FB event as comments on the event
*** enables people to [[person-tag]] themselves in the photos
** if someone took minutes [at the event]
** [[IRC]] log
** documents that were published

Documenting event creation UIs:
* [[create#Facebook_Events]]
and editing:
* [[edit#Facebook_Events]]

Event creation was somewhat dependent on having a post editing UI, to enable partial event creation then updating with details.

Private events - e.g. W3C AC meeting (next week)
* or a small [[private]] dinner, where you need a count of RSVP for planning

Separate discussion: registration (e.g. paid)
E.g. Facebook has a "tickets URL" to punt on it to some other site
