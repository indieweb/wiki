Jessica is in a band in Rhode Island, it has a [[Joomla]] web site, and she is now taking over.

Is able to edit the rehersal 'list' page, but doesn't know how to work with much else.  Contacted the webmester to tell her of the need to post more content, webmaster said she wanted to switch to [[Drupal]].

Does not do e-mail [[newsletter]]s, nor Facebook [[event]]s.  People put up fliers, word of mouth

Post to web site, push out to Facebook and Twitter would be cool.

Demonstration of user management and structured content (creating and relating different content types, defining fields of various types in Drupal.

Installed Drupal core on https://simplytest.me/ for the demo (gets wiped in 24 hours)

Ann: Also need for structured content.  Looking at Known.  Amy and i have worked on this sporadically.
