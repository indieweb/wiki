'''<dfn>2016 newskin</dfn>''' is a project to switch the IndieWebCamp default skin to a modern MediaWiki skin, such as [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector vector], before the IndieWeb Summit [[2016]] day 1. Final steps and switchover should be completed by or during day 0.

== Why ==
We need to switch the wiki to a default built-in skin that is compatible with MediaWiki updates.

== Non-goals ==
Note: we are only trying to make the wiki compatible with the "vector" skin.

Doing anything else (e.g. changing page/edit/watch etc. links, or the broader set of things that the 2014 [[wiki/redesign]] attempted) is a non-goal.

== Preview ==
You can preview any page on the wiki in the default "vector" skin.
E.g.:
* https://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&useskin=vector
* https://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?title=2016&useskin=vector

== Issues ==
Please note any issues in the preview of any page here:

=== add more... ===
* <nowiki><blockquote></nowiki> tags had a grey box in the old skin and now have no highlighting at all (e.g. on https://indiewebcamp.com/2016/D%C3%BCsseldorf/Demos in the first section)
* Default MediaWiki pages [[IndieWebCamp:Privacy_policy]], [[IndieWebCamp:About]], [[IndieWebCamp:General_disclaimer]] are linked in the footer and don't have content.
** added a redirect to [[what]] for the about page. <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/3473/profile-2016-med.jpg}}  [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 11:00, 7 June 2016 (PDT)
* ...

== To Do ==
* Update pages as needed to work with the Vector skin in the current version of MediaWiki.
* Upgrade MediaWiki to a recent version.
* Make CSS changes and minor HTML changes to the Vector skin to customize it for our needs. (e.g. adding the next event in the header like the current skin)

== Done ==
* Switch the default skin.
* Set $wgLogo to the URL path to the new logo
* CSS to float:right the TOC on all pages by default (instead of having to manually do it as on [[2016]]).
* Fix logo in top left to not be artifacty, and hopefully higher resolution for retina displays too per: https://twitter.com/sentience/status/739605100256067585 (switched to SVG logo)
* ...

== Participants ==
If you wish to actively help with this project, please list yourself here and be reasonably (e.g. daily) available on [[IRC]].

* {{veganstraightedge}}
* {{gRegor}}
* {{aaronpk}}
* ...

== Completed ==
As pages are previewed, and obviously page-specific problems fixed (preferably in a backward-compatible manner so they work today with the current skin and with the vector preview), list them here:
* [[Main_Page]]
* [[2016]]
* ...

This does not need to be a complete list, but hopefully by manually inspecting / fixing a few different kinds of pages, we can gain an understanding of what broader changes may be necessary.
