'''<dfn>IndieWeb Summit 2016 demos</dfn>''' took place June 5, 2016.

== {{shaners}} ==
published the first 5 of a long series of blogposts, starting with the What, Why, How, Where and Who of the Indieweb. [http://veganstraightedge.com/indieweb Index here]. All articles are syndicated to [[Wordpress.com]], [[Medium]] and [[tumblr]].

== Ed Borawski (znmeb) ==
is currently writing a book using [[Bookdown]], set up [https://www.masteringdfsanalytics.com/ a site] for it, added [[rel-me]] links and set up [[webmention.io]] and [[Bridgy]] for it. 

== {{emmak}} ==
showed the first version of her IndieWeb crawler/reader [[thready]], which makes long threads easier to read. Given a post, it crawls and shows the entire comment tree on one page. 

== {{gRegor}} ==
added local search to his home page. He hasn't found the best place for the UI yet, but he can search for text in all his posts and limit the search to specific time ranges. 

== Lillian Karabaic ==
updated the front page of http://anomalily.net for the first time since 2010 (after she tried to redesign the entire page at IWS 2015, which was way to much). It now has up-to-date information and pictures. She also helped {{shaners}} editing his articles.

== {{kylewm}} ==
added a [[service worker]] to [[Woodwind]]. For now, it displays a nicer error message when offline, but the goal is to cache articles and allow for offline reading as well as responding. 

== {{sandro}} ==
started to make a reader optimized for pictures, which shows the most-liked photos in the IndieWeb community. Right now, it only parses {{kylewm}}'s, {{aaronpk}}'s and {{rhiaro}}'s page as test-cases, and counts how often they have liked different posts. http://hawke.org/indie-liked.html shows the 20 most-liked posts.

== Tom Brown ==
uses [[Jekyll]] on [http://herestomwiththeweather.com his site], and worked on automatically sending webmentions. Since he builds locally, he can't send them during the build, so he added post-receive git hook to the server he uploads to, were a script then checks the RSS feed for new posts and sends Webmentions for them. (Sources: [https://gist.github.com/herestomwiththeweather/c1ec89cb22f6d97feed963b4b32309e3 hook] and [https://gist.github.com/herestomwiththeweather/f73dec9fdaa2ed0821594192f4a93cfd sender script])

== Cassie ==
fixed the blog for https://sensible.mn/blog, which was partially broken beforehand due to being installed at a sub-path.

== Jesus Fernandez ==
improved the jekyll workflow for [https://jfrndz.com his site]. He moved images and other media to [[Git-LFS]], added proper timestamps to his posts and wrote an /about page.

== Jim Pick ==
interviewed 2/3 of the IWS participants on what they would recommend a newcomer to the community to do. The most common advice was "Don't use GoDaddy!", followed by "it depends". If you own your domain name, you can start your site on tumblr or Medium or ... and start to publish content and move later to a better platform. The full results of his survey can be found [http://etherpad.indiewebcamp.com/onboarding-survey here].

== {{gwg}} ==
improved the webmention endpoint for WordPress. If you called it directly (without parameters), it returned only <code>"source" is missing</code>, now it shows a nice (and correctly themed) form for the two parameters that allows to manually send a webmention.

== {{julieannenoying}} ==
took awesome photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tollwerk/sets/72157669305156105

== {{aaronpk}} ==
got distracted from his original plan and extended the app he uses to post [[food]] and drink posts ([[Teacup]]) to take and post photos of the things he eats. "Not super happy about that I kind of enjoy doing that [...] We'll see what happens." [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/06/05/8/ example post]

His main goal was to add screenshots to his [[bookmark]] posts. Using [[wkhtml2pdf]], pages are rendered in a headless browser and converted to images. [https://aaronparecki.com/bookmarks examples]

== {{tantek}} and Will Madison ==
improved the wiki homepage to be more accessible to users with screen readers. Some issues found and fixed:
* bad default-alt-texts added by Mediawiki
* table-based layout
* manually formatted text, instead of proper sub-headings with <hX> tags
* image before content of HWC section, leaving a badly-labelled image/link before the text
* Links with markup like <code><nowiki>[http://indiewebcamp.com/]</nowiki></code> are shown as just [http://indiewebcamp.com/] and are not useful, since their text gives no indication if they are worth following
* image with alt-text that duplicated text below, replaced with "photo of "

Advice: 
* try a screen reader, e.g. [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback TalkBack] on Android
* if you develop apps, use tools to check for proper labels
* ...

== Scott Gruber ==
added rel-me and microformats to [https://scottgruber.me his site], and now can post articles and notes, organize them in categories and add links to related posts. 

== {{kylewm}} ==
cites some  [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-06-05/line/1465168146110 bridgy statistics]
