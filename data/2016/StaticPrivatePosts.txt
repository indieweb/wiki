Private Posts for Static Websites

Kinds of private posts:
* shared drafts
* this is only for me for all time
* this is for me and some subset of people

Use case:
* wanted to RSVP to indieweb summit but not make my attendance public
* "public" versus "publicized" - difference between who is able to access it, vs who it *should* be pushed to (hidden, draft, authenticated access ony) ?

Authentication at the web server level
* reads a list of domains that can view the post, the web server handles sending the HTTP headers for authentication

How to easily share with more than one person?
* create a URL for a group, add that URL as the audience for a post
* webmention for the URL to each person in the group would happen
* tie into rsvp?

the audience for this post is twitter.com/willnorris
* @willnorris can sign in with twitter to see the post
* any URL equivalent to twitter.com/willnorris can also view the post (bidirectional rel=me links)

Nginx Lua plugin to handle authentication at the web server level
* https://www.stavros.io/posts/writing-an-nginx-authentication-module-in-lua/
* where to store the access control list?
* an implementation detail, but there are many options
* a dot-file ACL where everything under that path is restricted to that audience
* in Redis
* in meta tags in the HTML (but then can't use this to protect images)
