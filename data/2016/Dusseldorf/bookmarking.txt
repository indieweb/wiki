[http://zambaldi.de/ Claudio] and Jochen run a bookmarking site, https://konektom.org

You bookmark stuff and then it suggests other things you might like.

How could this work for POSSE or PESOS?

[[POSSE]]:

# Be an [[IndieAuth]] provider
# Provide a [[micropub]] endpoint

Now we (Jeremy, Aaron, Glenn, etc.) can keep using our own bookmarking on our own sites but also publish to this third-party service.

Bookmark posting interfaces:
* Lots of us use [[bookmarklets]] for this.
* But bookmarklets don't work on mobile.
* If a third-party site solved that problem, that's a good reason to use its posting interface.

So what bookmarking services do people use (or have used)?
* [[Delicious]].
* Magnolia.
* [[Pinboard]].
* Devon Think.
