== examples ==

https://aaronparecki.com/travel
* exports ICS with times, local times in comments
* own microformat markup (h-itinerary, h-leg)

https://andrijevik.net/
* uses moment.js to display time nicely in different timezones, location2timezone from google maps
* local cache for timezone aliases. 
* (added markup for events etc during Day 2)

Both display travel with different legs/sections

travel store is the trustworthy source of information (info e-mails are unclear for timezones etc, with your own software you know what it can do reliably)

Tip: You should look up timezones from names/Locations, do not try to manually enter/remember offsets!

aaronpk displays trips afterwards:
* tracking app has buttons for start-end of trip, app uploads GPS track after he marks end of travel leg
* rendered to static map afterwards and displayed on site, example: https://aaronparecki.com/2016/05/08/17/ Image created using: https://github.com/esripdx/Static-Maps-API-PHP
** random interesting detail: it uses the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm to simplify geo data because plotting all exact points unnecessary when zoomed out

== services/applications ==
* gmaps, many tools around OSM (e.g. https://github.com/flopp/go-staticmaps), ...

* aaronpk made http://atlas.p3k.io with useful services for timezones, maps, ...,
** timezone lookup database using a list of 20k cities and their timezones. https://github.com/aaronpk/Atlas/blob/master/p3k/Timezone.php (warning, large site behind link)

* GitHub has embeddable maps from GeoJSON https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/
