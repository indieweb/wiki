Personal vs professional

What should your website do for you?

Variety of posts as a way to liberate you from the obligations / confines of one type of post

Time to first note on a personal website

From silos:
* quantifications
* activity over time (sparkline-boom after [[2016/Nuremberg|N端rnberg]])

How to make the home-page more "timeless"
* idea 1: show one update at the top, instead of feed, followed by profile page (http://glennjones.net/ )

creative constraints, e.g. in limited silo layouts or templates can be useful

How would you judge success of a homepage?
* I am impressed?
* Others are impressed?
* Getting across the most amount of information?
* An expression of who I am?

On your personal page you can do crazy things
* interactive header images etc
* keep old styles (https://adactio.com/ has stylesheet switcher, tanteks old page (link?) had different CSS for different months, with current experiments)
