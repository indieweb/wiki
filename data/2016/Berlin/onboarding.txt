'''[[2016/Berlin/onboarding|IndieWeb onboarding]]''' was an all-day session on hacking day during IndieWebCamp Berlin. We tried to analyze where the current paths for becoming part of the IndieWeb may not serve new target groups, segment these newcomers and generate an approach for easing their onboarding process.

In the demo session, it was agreed that commenting and further work on these concept stubs can happen in the Discussion section at the end of this wiki page.

== Background ==

We started with a short rundown on the history of the IndieWeb movement, which helped to understand why the original entry requirements were intentionally rather high - "keep out people who just talk, and get things done instead".

We reviewed [[generations|IndieWeb generations]], a model from 2014 that can be utilized for us to build upon. In our discussion, we identified that the IndieWeb is currently somewhere at the border between gen 1 and 2, or maybe already with gen 2 well underway (e.g. looking at the demographics of IWC Berlin 2016 participants).

== Results of morning discussions ==

We discussed various aspects of onboarding: personality, motives/motivations, possible roadblocks, ideas for making... (sorry, notes partly in German)

== Personas ==

'''N.B. below table is preserved for documentation purposes - the personas have since been developed further, [[2017/Nuremberg/onboarding|see Indiewebcamp Nuremberg 2017 session]]'''

In the afternoon, we worked on developing personas of "future IndieWeb users" (work-in-progress, unfinished)

== Future ideas ==

Utilize understanding of new target groups to develop suitable onboarding flows.

* Use personas to ease the consideration of different personalities in the design of IndieWeb documentation, marketing, events etc.
* Reconsider the participation threshold for IWC, indieauth vs. other sign-up (connected with providing a guaranteed starting session on Saturday mornings before session planning starts)
* Turn the understding about different variables and thresholds to design easy-to-use intro material online (e.g. a "step-by-step guide" that asks the user a series of questions and then presents them with an individual roadmap how to join the IndieWeb
