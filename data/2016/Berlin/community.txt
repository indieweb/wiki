Berlin 2016

sgreger: observations: local crowd is mixed in skill and specialisation
* getting sterted, withknown only "one-stop-shop"
* wordpress had difficulty with microformat markup

question: what parts are in the starter package?

sl007: asked users of other CMSes to get input for his
*UI to apply microformats to existing structure?
*wiki is difficult to get into, requirement for wiki signup for beginners is difficult - this will make it hard for novices to join the indieweb movement. They cannot actively connect through the wiki.
*suggestion of simpler signup flow to get rel-me started quicker, guiding people to edit their profile

WP plugins not good enough for beginners now

Oliver:
*not everyone wants to "publish" - likes and comments feel different
*maybe specialist system for that?

getting domains is difficult for non-tech people

Indieauth as first step doesn't have a clear benefit. setting up indieauth to get Bridgy is worth it, just getting on some strange wiki is less cool

criticism from crpyto side: we don't  <..........>

*<Zegnat> Hosting is a running problem, discussed often, e.g. https://indieweb.org/2016/Indiehosting
*<sl007> soverin.net

discussion about coupling domain and webspace

domains are by quite strong authority gueranteed to be owned and individual
brennan: also high risk in case off loss. My content is important, doesn't matter where it is. even if it is posted somewhere else, the important thing is that is *from me*.

back to: how to make it more attractive to less convinced and less technical people
sgreger: write high-level idea document
indiewebify me is more technical debugging tool, less "why do I want this/what's my best way to get there"

sbischoff: indieweb.org maybe should have clearer examples for the benefits, to make it easier "what does it mean for me"

is there a list of indieweb use cases? 
* self-dogfooding is the underlying ideas

potential selling point is "personal archive" for social media.

POSSE vs PESOS? Maybe PESOS is a better starter compromise for DIY setup. ( users still are used to old tools)
