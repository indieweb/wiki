== Notes ==
Topic: Which CMSes can you use for running your IndieWeb site.

* [[Wordpress]] is the big elephant in the room. There are numerous plugins, but the main crux is that adding [[microformats]] is too hard for non-technies - because the template files need to be adjusted for that.
* [[Known]] is a nicely working system that brings everything out of the box. Not nearly as many themes as there are for Wordpress.
* Nobody here knows anyone using [[Drupal]]
* Nobody here knows anyone using [[Joomla]]
