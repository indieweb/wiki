Indiewebcamp Berlin 2016

intro: basic idea, full stream, gets noisy with replies

sgreger: few articles, so full feed, but with quick filters

Flo: portfolio, blog posts, interactive stuff

traditionally the feed was in front often, but that's really not necessary

sgregor
main page:
* selected text in the middle,
* stream with bookmarks etc in the left drawer
* contact ect in the right drawer
* expanding examples changes blog stream to relevant posts
