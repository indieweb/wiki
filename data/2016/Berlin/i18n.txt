i18n - Internationalization

differences in detecting languages

e.g. Zen decides by TLD first, then by browser language and they plan
redirecting based on browser settings ...

some redirect by browser settings but does the user want that ?

sl007: image metadata is tricky (publish multiple files for multiple languages)

many people have mixed feeds, filtering would be interesting (e.g. create filtered feeds with only one language, feeds preferring translation in one language)

How to deal with permalinks? Are different translations completely different objects? how linked should they be?
* Seeing YouTube videos with most the comments in russian or japanese feels weird. I want to see english and german mixed, my US audience might not.
