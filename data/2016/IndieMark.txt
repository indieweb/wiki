Overview (did IndieMark Levels summary)

Where are people?
* Tantek.com: level 3, working on level 4
* youmom.io: 4 and 3 in pieces (but IndieAuth is broken)
* willnorris.com: pieces up to level 3. working on fleshing out those levels, not necessarily looking to move to level 4 in the immediate future
* Dark Matter: 2
* isgeek.net: 1
* david.shanske.com 4 
* ...
* ... lots of level 1

New Features to incorporate into somewhere in there
* [[Micropub]] (already in posting UI axis)
* [[Vouch]] (sending - which axis? where is sending webmentions?, receiving vouch in "handling responses" axis)
* [[private posts]] (support: [[WordPress]], [[Dark Matter]], [[Known]]; possibly auth axis)
* [[public drafts]] (Falcon, ???)
* consuming [[IndieAuth]] (possibly auth axis)
** showing [[private contact info]] (via IndieAuth consuming)

Tweaks?
* next/prev [[navigation]] - can we make it more general
** instead of dictating a particular navigation style (next/prev), could Level 2 simply require some ability to navigate your posts?

* L1 "index navigation" (top-down)
* L2 "inter-post navigation" 
* L3 "time-based archives"

More levels?

Presentation:
* visual presentation as a series of segmented rings like http://rng.io/
* ...

http://Indiewebify.me is a good test site for various IndieMark levels

Additional thoughts:

* [[Salmentions]] - sending/receiving should go into which axis?
