== Notes ==
We're going to be talking [[Chalice]] ( https://github.com/awslabs/chalice )

Python microframework, similar to Flask ( http://flask.pocoo.org/ ) or Bottle ( http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html )

Thin HTTP wrapper (GET, POST, paths)

In this sessions, we'll be going through a quick hello world / install using their README

# create a Python virtual environment
# install dependencies
# create a project
# set up AWS credentials ~/.aws/config
# ran into setup issues beyond the scope of a quick session

Digging in to a working example.

* output from Chalice is a lambda function that is uploaded to [[AWS Lambda]]. Looking at the resulting lambda in the console.
* example app is triggered by an AWS cron that calls the lambda every 10 or 15 minutes
* this particular app:
** queries Twitter API for trending hashtags
** grabs the volume of tweets
** searches whois data for hashtag + ".com"
** if domain is available, add the domain and tweet volume to a google spreadsheet

For indieweb projects, Chalice makes it easy to use the AWS lambda http endpoints.

* For example, could make a Chalice-based micropub endpoint that adds posts to a GitHub Pages site
* AWS lambda also supports lots of other triggers, such as IoT buttons
** e.g. send a micropub post to your site when you push a button

AWS Lambda frees you from dealing with operating systems, hosting hardware, etc.
