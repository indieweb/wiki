Jessica's stuff - all the places that I have data that I don't own/control:
* Twitter
* Facebook 
* Instagram
* Flickr
* Dribbble
* Yelp
* LinkedIn 
* Google - maps, etc.
* Delicious
* Fitbit  
* last.fm
* Spotify? 
* Goodreads 
* Blogs 

What to do?
* Start with jessicaklein.com
* Can move data over part by part 
* You can't do everything you want to - you need to prioritize the things that are most important 

Framework

;MAKE YOUR MARK 
:make a personal site

;GENERATE
:link to where you are elsewhere - or you can do POSSE, publish on own site and syndicate elsewhere

;SYNTHESIZE
:Cluster, synthesize 

;CONNECT 
:are there communities?

the term "personal web site" is on TV ads 
wix.com, squarespace 

UI/UX is job 1
