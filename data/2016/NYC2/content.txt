Guiding Questions:
* What are some ideas for what to put on your personal site?
** What would you like to be?
** What are you passionate about?

How do you make yourself write regularly online? 

'''Larry'''
* twitter
* blogs 

'''Marty''' 
* builds lots of services and tools and  invites friends to join 

What is your audience? 

You may write for yourself but it's ok to be public 

Una Kravets personal goals Github repo:
https://github.com/una/personal-goals

Tantek led a session on the same thing (URL above)

Schoolhouse Rock style - how a thought becomes a post 

"I'm just a thought...."  - a la how a bill becomes a law 

Jess
* posts goals to github https://github.com/iamjessklein/goals
* does blogging happen at big milestones or moments in time?

Atul
* perfectionism gets in the way of finished posting
* gets over the hump of creating a draft by writing it as an email to a friend
* blogged once or twice a month about work

Website updates can often coincide with looking for jobs.
* blogged about the Mozilla project when he worked there 
* 18F 

ok to blog about what you have learned even if you feel it's not advanced enough

find a way to anonymize your work stories 

Label posts as not finished 
* "beta" 
* "under construction" 

find a way to label the 'unfinished' ones -- some sort of banner
like the Github ribbon 

Celebrate your successes 

Turning Thoughts into posts :
* Twitter-like notes -- post it as a partial thought 
* then you can weave them into a longer post 
** the notes (tweets) have a permalink 
    
Can use your past tweets 

pinboard.in -- they pull in your tweets 

Twitter does not display all your tweets! but you can request them
