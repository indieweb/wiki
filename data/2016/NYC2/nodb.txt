== Notes ==
Eric Lewis session on web sites with no db

Wanted an [[Evernote]] replacement that would be free

to avoid paying he wanted to write an in browser text editor  

tricky parts 
# working offline, say in the subway  
# working on any device  
# Syncing

it has a github repo  

this is the Github repo 
https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/pad

does not want to run a database 

idea - storing the files on Github 

Github now offers free private hosting 

[[Jekyll]] - a static site generator 
you give it markdown files 

HTML is simple and safer and faster 

[[service workers]] - implementing it is easy (for making your site work offline)
