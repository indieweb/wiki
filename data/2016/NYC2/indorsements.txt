== Notes ==
Indorsements is short for "Indieweb Endorsements"

Jess demo'd skillsbot, a Slack bot with a conversational interface for self-reporting level of interest and experience for various topics.
* has a pre-determined list of skills (e.g. Information Architecture / Design)
* users talk w/ Skills Bot to give 1-5 ratings of their interest and their experience level for these skills
* this can be used to find people who are a good match for specific projects, or mentoring opportunities

Use cases for endorsements:
* finding folks to do work
* finding mentors
* finding interested learners
* portfolio to display past work

Examples of skills
* achievements in video games
* work done during a degree program
* contributed work to a specific project
* being a "good" participant at an event
** what makes a "good" participant?

David suggested that an individual writes an endorsement on their site and sends it(via webmention) to the person they are endorsing.  Or you post on your site a skill and people webmention-endorse it...

What's the difference between an endorsement, a recommendation, or a review?

Another David suggestion: you post an assertion on your own site, others reply to it with a post endorsing/supporting
* Different from badges (where you have nothing until somebody gives you a badge)
* You own the actual content and the replies strengthen the assertion

Asserting your skill / qualification *first* is far more "indie" than the badges model, where you're nothing until someone *else* grants you a badge for something.

'''Questions:'''
* Do we display the web of trust?
* Who endorses the endorsers? 
* Who is the person for which their reputation is so stellar that everyone trusts them?
* '''What is the UX of getting an endorsement?''' 
** '''Then, what is the plumbing needed to support it?''' 

'''Examples/ Inspiration:'''
* [[Makerbase]] ( https://makerbase.co/about/ ) was discusssed as a silo for endorsements
* [[LinkedIn]] https://www.linkedin.com/ silo endorsement
* Open Badges http://openbadges.org/ not exactly an indie web way of doing endorsement
* [[Meetup.com]] post-event "good to see you" messages - https://www.meetup.com/SCSCMD/messages/40974722/
* Ring Mark: http://rng.io/
* Post-wedding "thank you" acknowledgement notes

Action Items
* Journey mapping the user stories < ----- you are asserting it rather than waiting for a badge
* Someone should Post an assertion
* Another person should endorse that assertion
