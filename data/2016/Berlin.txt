<div class="p-description description">

Join us in Berlin (Brunnenviertel) for '''two days''' of a BarCamp-style gathering of web creators building and sharing open web technologies to empower users to own their own identities & content, and build blocks for the #indieweb!

The <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> movement is a global community that is building an open set of principles and methods that empower people to take back ownership of identity and data instead of relying on 3rd party websites.

At IndieWebCamp you‚Äôll learn about ways to empower yourself to own your data, create & publish content on your own site, and optionally syndicate to third-party silos.<br/> Along the way you‚Äôll get a solid grounding in the history and future of Microformats, IndieAuth, WebMention, Micropub and more!<br/><strong>Remote participants, see below.</strong><br/>

[[File:iwc-hoodies-2.jpg|300px|right|IndieWebCamp Hoodie are ready!]]

{{jkphl}} is organizing a batch of IndieWebCamp hoodies and bringing them to IWC Berlin. The hoodies will be of proper quality (= not necessarily the cheapest ones) and '''printed by a local textile printer''' ‚Äî there's no online shop or similar. Mailing the hoodies to anywhere in the world should be no problem as well but right now I've got no idea about the shipping charges (same applies to customs).

Please '''add yourself to the list below including the size you'd like to order''' (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL). Alternatively drop me a line on Twitter, IRC or by email and I'm happy to add you here. I'll keep this description updated as soon as I get to know any further details. Thanks for spreading the word!

'''Update 2016-10-17''': Each hoodie will cost ‚Ç¨ 29,-- (including 19% VAT). I can write you a proper invoice if you need one. It's going to be the [http://www.sols-europe.com/gb/snake.html SOL'S UNISEX HOODED SWEAT-SHIRT] and it's available in '''Black''', '''Dark Grey''' and '''French Navy''' (as seen on the website), so please add your colour to the list as well. I will have to order the hoodies on Thursday, October 20th, at latest, otherwise it wouldn't be in time for Berlin.

'''Update 2016-10-20''': The hoodies are in production now, there no sense in adding yourself to the list any longer. If there's demand we could think about another batch at a later time again. Thanks for all your orders!

[https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2016/ Beyond Tellerand Berlin 2016] is 2016-11-07..09. The organizer(s) are likely to want to hold an IndieWebCamp on the weekend before or after:

{{jkphl}} made contact with Contentful (see also [https://accessibility-club.org Accessibility Club] on Monday, Nov 7th), waiting for response; 

(!) "Mozilla Spaces" response :

[deu]
"Hi Sebastian, das h√∂rt sich grunds√§tzlich machbar an, es h√§ngt wahrscheinlich gr√∂√ütenteils davon ab, ob wir Mozilla employees finden, die Zeit zum hosten haben. Ich muss mal schauen wie es bei mir zeitlich aussieht und werd eine Email an das B√ºro schreiben...  Was hattest du dir denn an Catering vorgestellt? Nur Lunch f√ºr zwei Tage k√∂nnte machbar sein, ..."

[eng, translated]
"Hi, sounds doable. Mostly depends if we find Mozilla employees to host. I will see if I can make him [note by editor: strongly convinced him again] and will write a mail to the office. What did you like for catering? Just lunch for two days could be doable. [note by editor: ordered enough coffee]"
