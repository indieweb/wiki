=== Performance ===
{{t}} '''#[[performance]].''' Measuring & improving site/permalink load time.
* "40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load". - Google I/O "Mobile Web: State of the Union"  
* '''Tools.''' How can we easily measure our own indieweb site [[homepage]] and [[permalink]] load times?
* '''Techniques.''' What techniques can we use to help our sites load in less than 3 seconds to provide a better/faster experience than silos?
** Whose sites already do this?
* '''Subsecond!''' "AMP files load in an average of 400ms" (ibid)
** Challenge accepted. How can we make our homepages load in an average of 400ms?

=== Offline ===
{{t}} '''#[[offline]].''' Making viewing and posting work offline work with your website
* '''Use-cases.''' No network. Lie-fi. But still want to view latest posts, write a new post, or edit a draft! Especially [https://snarfed.org/posting-to-the-indieweb-from-your-phone using your indieweb site from your mobile device].
* '''Tools.''' HTTPS, Service Worker, Cache API, Background Sync

=== Progressive Web Apps ===
{{kylewm}} '''#[[PWA]].''' The overlap with #offline might be pretty significant here. Discuss building offline-first web apps that can be installed to the Home screen. Maybe a particular (self-serving) focus on how to make a reader like Woodwind a PWA. I don't even really know what this is, but I'm going to try to learn before Saturday!
