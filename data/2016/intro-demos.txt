'''<dfn>Personal Website Demos</dfn>''' at [[2016|IndieWeb Summit 2016]].

* [https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-06-04#t1465061520610000 Chat logs] starting at 10:34 PDT

== Group demo ==
A group demo with {{benwerd}} (https://werd.io/), {{aaronpk}}, (https://aaronparecki.com/), and {{kylewm}}, (<nowiki>https://kylewm.com</nowiki>, unfortunately now a [[zombie]] site)

{{benwerd}}:
* hi everyone - I'm Ben Werdm√ºller - my website is werd.io which took me a year to realise people saw as weirdo
* I am going to post a short note: http://werd.io/2016/really-happy-to-be-here-at-indiewebsummit

{{aaronpk}}
* so I have a bookmarklet in the browser that lets me reply to ben by clicking a link: https://aaronparecki.com/2016/06/04/8/ 
* and now you can see that my reply shows up on his site too: http://werd.io/2016/really-happy-to-be-here-at-indiewebsummit 
* I post other things on my site, eg last nights sleep: https://aaronparecki.com/2016/06/04/3/ so you can see I may be a bit cranky today 
* I also post my cycle rides: https://aaronparecki.com/rides
* shows sleep, coffee, bicycling, running tracking on his site

{{benwerd}}:
* I'm going to reply on my site and link to aaron's, but not share it to twitter this time http://werd.io/2016/aw-i-miss-riding-bikes 
* I'm not logging bike rides, but I am going to check in here: http://werd.io/2016/checked-into-vadio-1 and could share to foursquare 
* the idea here is to make owning my own social content seamless, so I don't have to think about it 
* I have to think about it when I'm writing @withknown, but if you install code you shouldn't have to 
* now we shouldn't need to check each others' websites all the time to see if they have posted, but {{kylewm}} has an answer 

{{kylewm}}:
* I want to show https://woodwind.xyz/ which is a reader that I wrote for other people's websites 
* It shows them as a timeline, and has blogposts, short notes, replies and so on 
* here's a video that emma posted a few days ago, and I can repost that on my site <nowiki>https://kylewm.com/2016/06/repost-of-emma-kuo-alankara-jazzy-d-higher-love-fender</nowiki> 
* I can also like things, and reply 
* and my repost shows up on Emma's site too ([https://web.archive.org/web/20161220224212/http://notenoughneon.com/2016/6/3/1 Archived])
* You can subscribe to indieweb sites that use microfromats for markup, or sites that use older feeds in Atom and RSS

{{benwerd}}:
* part of using the indieweb seamlessly is being able to post from anywhere so I'm posting from my phone (twitter.com/_/status/739151187518361601)
* I'm going to post an audio file I recorded earlier via my phone http://werd.io/2016/im-a-bear 
* once it is posted it can be seen anywhere from mobile or desktop browser 
* one of the things I want to do is video, though doing that with a web browser is hard. 
* because I have an iphone I can't let you record audio from a web browser, but working on making that better 

{{aaronpk}}:
* I want to show you more about how my reply worked. I don't have a posting ui on my website
* I use woodwid,xyz, but mainly use https://quill.p3k.io/ which is a micropub client I wrote I log in with indieauth 
* That worked almost too well - I was already logged in so it just worked. let me log out and show the process 
* so when I am asked to login I get an indieauth prompt asking for posting permissions via micropub 

Q&A: 
* q: if you have static files built from a static site generator, can you still use micropub? 
** {{aaronpk}}: yes you can because people have built tools that let you post to git from micropub 
** {{benwerd}}: you can just use wordpress and add indieweb plugins, or you can use https://withknown.com/ 

* {{t}}: I'd like to introduce {{GWG}} and {{willnorris}} who have made wordpress work 
** {{aaronpk}}: there are also tools so you can add webmention support even to a static site
** {{t}}: all of these sites added indieweb features one at a time, and each one gets you something 
** {{t}}: every thing you do give you one feature - it's not a giant computer sciency stack that requires you change it all
** {{shaners}}: you are using http and html on your site already, and all these tools and components built on this 

* {{aaronpk}}: what happens if you post a comment and it ends up in these sites, how do you update or delete? 
** {{aaronpk}}: the webmention spec includes a way to propagate updates and deletes, and tests for that at https://webmention.rocks/ 
** {{kylewm}}: updating text is just sending a webmention again, as the URL is the identifier


{{benwerd}}:
* My demo of voice bot is using chrome for voice inout and rules on the backend to respond. no machine learning 

{{aaronpk}}:
* I do want to have posts that only certain people can see - {{benwerd}} and {{shaners}} have this 
* comments that are partially private are harder to share 
* if you're trying to implement POSSE, how do you do that? Quill just tells your micropub endpoint what to do 
* one way to POSSE is to use brid.gy Publish by adding links which bridgy fills in 
* the other is [[silo.pub]] which give a common micropub api to multiple silos in a standard form 

== Eric Drechsel ==
* My site is http://eric.pdxhub.org and it is built from github 
* I use hypothes.is to annotate other websites, which goes into a silo 
* this weekend I am working on camlistore which is good at sucking data in from lots of places 
* I want to integrate these indieweb protocols with camlistore this weekend 

== Erik Moeller ==
* My site is http://intelligentdesigns.net/ and I want to show off https://freeyourstuff.cc/ to bring your stuff from silos 
* uses your own login as a browser plugin and pull down just your stuff 
* what I'm working on right now is a way to bring your reviews back to your site

== Emma ==
* <nowiki>notenoughneon.com</nowiki> ([https://web.archive.org/web/20161005223159/http://notenoughneon.com/ Archived])
* my site is notenoughneon.com and @notenoughneon everywhere
* I use Quill for posting - I don't have my own publishing interface and bridgy publish to posse to twitter,facebook 
* so here's my post, ([https://web.archive.org/web/20161220234850/http://notenoughneon.com/2016/6/4/1 Archived]) can you reply to that on your own site or twitter 
* this posting through my backend to s3 and github
* this uses a technique called PURL which uses the HTML of the posts as a content store ([https://web.archive.org/web/20161026003349/http://notenoughneon.com/2016/5/29/purl-a-portable-content-store Archived]) 
* my site is powered by [[Skein]]. It's open source: https://github.com/notenoughneon/skein

== Salt ==
* {{altsalt}}
* My website is http://www.altsalt.net indieweb is very new to me, but I've worked on my web site for decades 
* I started implementing h-entry stuff, but i want to show how I point my links to my profiles 
* all his social media profile links, go through a personal redirect on his site
* which turns out to be an issue with indieauth
* so he added an invisible <link> to get it working so he could sign-in and RSVP
* I route profile links through a short link on my own site, but indieauth doesn't follow links like that 

== Shane Becker ==
* {{shaners}}
* Who has deployed something to heroku? my url is http://veganstraightedge.com
* I'm building software for myself called darkmatter and github is still a lot of stuff 
* heroku shipped a feature called a deploy hook - link to http://deploy.herokuapp.com/ from a github repo to deploy 
* I have a link on my site that lets you deploy your own darkmatter instance
* here's my talk on dark matter: http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2016/05/12/dark-matter-and-the-indieweb

== Will Norris ==
* {{willnorris}}
* My site is https://willnorris.com/ - there's a soccer player in England called Will Norris and he can't get any url 
* I use jekyll as my personal site - I ddin't to anything fancy - I author all my posts in vim and push markdown 
* I have a little command line tool for inserting timestamps and one to insert the epoch as a newbase60 
* I do git push live to create the post - here it is https://willnorris.com/2016/06/indieweb-demo 
* and I have a command line tool to send the webmentions from the link in my post 
* I'm using bridgy to do my outbound posse and it is very manual 
* I've built a lot of go libraries - the go webmention library includes this command line tool
* so you don't need a lot of infrastructure to get up and running

== David Shanske ==

* "I have almost 500 contacts in my Gmail, not accessible to me."
* "I have files and files and files in Google Drive, where I started creating thoughts in 2010. And I can't access it. It works kinda janky. I don't think that's acceptable."
* I have hundreds of people in my contacts in gmail, and documents in gdrive that are hard to get to 
* there si a twitter app for the blind called chicken nugget https://q-continuum.net/chicken_nugget/
