Feedburner exists and still allows people to subscribe to RSS via email

H-entry can be used to create RSS

Jeremy draws a diagram

h-entry to RSS to Feedburner to email

Breakdown of the problem
* 1:1 email
** [[mailchimp]] has free RSS to Email service ( https://indieweb.org/this-week/feed.xml )
** awebber
** converkit
** constant contact
** postmatic (WordPress specific - used by GWG)
* many:1 email digest

How can one allow people to reply to one of these emails and convert to webmention to post back to someone's site
* [[questo.email]]
* [[quill]] has email to micropub
* [[wordpress]] has post by email, arbitrary string @ domain
* listserv?
* ifttt.com to trigger emails
** or to
*** facebook
*** üêå snailmail ( https://lob.com/services/postcards )
*** mobi ebook (calibre) ( https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A1RGGPBKDR1BPZ )
*** web push notifications (pushpad.xyz)

Is anyone posting an email to their website and then sending a copy to a mailing list?
