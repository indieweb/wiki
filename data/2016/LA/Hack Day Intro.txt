'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp LA 2016 hack, create, design, and build day</dfn>''' took place November 6, 2016.

[[2016/LA|IndieWebCamp LA 2016]] / [[2016/LA/Schedule|Schedule]]

Day 2 of IndieWebCamp is our hack, create, design, and build day.

== General Advice ==

# Still not sure what to hack on? '''Checkout [[IndieMark]]''' for some next steps for your site.
# Find '''one really simple thing''' to add to your site before lunch, one more challenging thing after lunch.
# '''Ask for help''' if you're stuck at all - you are short on time, but surrounded by high-bandwidth expertise. Ask on [[IRC]], ask your neighbors, ask an organizer.
# '''Help someone''' get unstuck. Listen and if you hear a question about something you know something about, take a few minutes to help someone or direct them to a resource on the wiki.

== Hack means create ==
IndieWebCamp focuses on [[design]] and [[UX]] before protocols, formats, code.

Thus when we say hack, we mean create.

Anything you create for your own site counts for hack day.

E.g.
* '''visual [[design]]''' - sketches of what you want your visual design to look like, all the way to a fully beautiful statis or HTML+CSS prototype of a visual design
* '''[[user interface]]''' - sketches of wireframes etc.
* '''[[ux]] flow''' - documentation of how elements in a UI flow from page to page
* '''translation of UX to protocol flow''' - ux flow translated into protocols and formats steps - take an existing UX flow, and document the steps in terms of what protocols and formats are being used to implement the steps of a UX flow.
* '''code''' - yes, code still counts for hacking too - it's just not the only thing that counts. take an existing documentation of how to implement something in terms of protocols and formats, and implement it on your own site.

== Hack Sessions ==

Hack Session Proposals 
# write down on a sticky note:
#* '''what''' you're going to work on
#* your '''name'''
#* '''hashtag'''
# Announce what you're doing
#* pick an '''area''' / room / space
#* '''before/after lunch'''
#* and put your sticky up '''on the grid'''

'''Join forces''' with others working on similar things.
