* as I mentioned earlier, having an identity, and having an h-card
* (shows boffosocko.com)
* it's a bit of variety slanguage
* In Hollywood when someone says your movie did boffo, it means your movie did really well at the box office
* In a muppets movie
* and there's a scene where Kermit says it's going to be boffo, it's going to be socko, and so I went and got the domain name
* I've got a PGP key, email address, even a few things hiding that don't show but if you have a tool that pulls it up you can see it
* my favorite thing is, recently I went to an event
* and a councilman of the city of LA gave me an honor
* I do a lot of work for literacy in the city
* and I posted up a photo of this to Instagram, and my site went out and posted it to my site
* and my site automatically sent this post to FB, Twitter, G+, maybe LinkedIn
* down here there's a syndicated to section
* then it got the biggest response to anything that I got ever
* I logged in the next morning
* Bridgy sent webmentions for all these things back to my website
* and not just seeing the messages, but every like had its own line-item
* hundreds of people liked it on FB, dozens of people wrote short notes
* and it had a visceral impact, more than just seeing the number 557 people liked this
* to me this was way more personal, to see each individual one with a name and face 
* to me, part of that process would have been killed on Facebook, because it would have just showed a number, and I never would have seen the names and faces of the people that I know and love say hey I liked this
* this is really a part of what I like about the IndieWeb
* this site runs on WordPress
* with the IndieWeb Plugin and 4-5 others
* (showed http://boffosocko.com/2016/11/03/so-yeah-this-happened-today/ )

=== {{gwg}} ===
* shows david.shanske.com
* this is my website, it's barebones, the name of this theme is bearbones (with an ea)
* there's very little in terms of style
* so you'd focus on everything else
* also a WordPress site
* this is the last thing I posted
* I went to Woodstock
* there's a picture
* One of the things that I've done for a long time in the community is work on IndieWeb plugins for WordPress
* I do most of my testing on an alternate version of the site
* I've added how to make different types or kinds of posts
* If I went to my live site, you won't see as many choices because I don't use them all, but they're there
* the other thing I added is a box so I can react to another article
* any article I happen to be reading it will automatically pull in some data
* when it was updated, summary, publication (if any), and the name
* so I spend a lot of time building tools like that
* when it's all done it shows up on my site
* all the photos, etc. location
* this is one of those link-previews that I have looks like
* I guess that's it and we'll see if I what I build this weekend

=== {{tantek}} ===
* He's Tantek and this is his website, tantek.com
* Chris has never heard his last name pronounced.
* At the end of 2009, he became very frustrated with Twitter
* He hated the fail whale.
* He started with notes, then added photos, etc.
* Anything he posted on his other sites, he now posts on his own.
* He can do what he wants, he can keep it minimal
* He won't worry if an update of someone else's will break his stuff as he controls it all.
* Putting stuff on your own site may be more powerful than social media. You can push it whereever you want.
* He was frustrated because he created a new Twitter account and followed three people and got locked
* tantek: Mostly just posts to Twitter using Bridgy
* It all started really simple
* It started out as a response to frustration, but now he is FREE!!!
* Free at last
* Chris mentioned scientific papers, etc.
* Chris bringds up Marginalia
* Marginalia allows you to comment on specific paragraphs
* tantek would like to allow people to link to specific paragraphs on his site as well
* This weekend, he encourages people to start small and build
* Everything here started small
* aaronpk's website wasn't built in a day

=== Rachel ===
* my domain name is being held hostage by google
* mostly I want to listen and learn

=== Jocelyn ===
* Jocelyn.inturnaround.com
* Jocelyn is looking for a way to watch and get notified of when people post
* Chris: (shows woodwind.xyz)
* Internal Server error!
* Demo failed
* KevinMarks_: Woodwind.xyz was doing that to me yesterday too
* The other is aaronpk
* tantek demonstrates woodwind
* We discover he only subscribes to aaronpk and himself
* then I added boffosocko.com and adactio.com to show more stuff showing up in woodwind

=== {{adactio}} ===
* my name is Jeremy and my website is adactio.com
* I've been blogging for ~15 years
* when I write a blog post I syndicate out to Medium
* a lot of people are blogging on Medium, but what I like to do is give Medium a copy
* this is what we do on the indieweb - POSSE
* I've got a links section also
* I was syndicating it out to Delicious, are they still around?
* I used to use link services, delicious, magnolia but they all end up getting shut down
* GWG Pinboard is still doing well.
* common theme, you put all this energy into another website, and then it gets shutdown
* you spend all this time writing for other sites, only for the data to disappear
* so that's kind of the thing we do, write on your own website, and just send copies to other sites
* I have notes too
* with photos
* typically I POSSE out to places
* e.g. here is a photo on my site, and on Twitter
* and all the likes on my site from Twitter
* thanks to Bridgy
* GWG Everybody Loves Bridgy
* not only do I syndicate out to these places
* but when people comment, like etc. I get that back on my site
* I like it when I post an article, and people post comments on their own sites
* I have control over my data, and they have control over their data
* I've been adding incrementally at indiewebcamps, photos, etc.
* that's generally what happens at indiewebcamp, one day we discuss thigns, get ideas, and day 2 we hack things
* like these sparklines, I think I built at IWC NÃ¼rnberg
* got some ideas, and what I'm working and hacking

=== Neal ===
* this is my website: http://wiki-njnm.rhcloud.com/view/welcome-visitors/
* the unfortunately named . wiki-...
* it's a fedwiki, supposed to be like github for notes
* it's an old version, you can copy paste script tags and such
* it's gotten to a point where it takes like 3 seconds to load
* as far as I know it's the longest fedwiki page ever
* today I want to figure out what to do about this
* I can paste javascript straight into the page
* It's kind of nice, you can drag & drop stuff
* gRegorLove: That's Smallest Federated Wiki?
* this is my personal replacement to Delicious getting shutdown
* (discussion about is delicious being resurrected or not)

=== Michael Kirk ===
* this is a wordpress site, mostly a premium theme: mikirk.com
* my name is Michael Kirk so it's a condensed form
* I'm a graphic artist and designer
* I used to use uber.com which was a place to do personal art sites and one month it was gone. that's what brings me here

=== Jeffrey ===
* Hi I'm Jeffrey, an indiewebcamp newbie. I'm an artist and a web developer too.
* all my pages are built with a static site generator, called nana (sp?) in Ruby I think
* I have many domain names
* like this is my personal backup/archive of everything
* like this is my database of drawings
* it's a ruby on rails app
* it makes thumbnails, I can tag them, how large they are, they are location based. this database has about 4000 records in it
* plenty of ways to navigate it, autopilot features
* nothing being posted to other sites, I don't trust them.
* the other thing I make is a lot of drawing tools
* like this is a drawing tool, it draws automatically and you can click No or Paint
* I have too many domains and want to figure out a way to do that better
* I'm trying to figure out a way to bring my own community into an actual place where people own their information but can still talk to each other
* "I am my own silo"

== Closing Demos ==
Closing demos took place 2016-11-06 ([https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-11-06#t1478475384024000 logs]).

=== Michael Kirk ===
* I'm Michael Kirk of http://www.mikirk.com.
* Today I hooked up Brid.gy and got Flickr, G+, Twitter, and Facebook
* My first POSSEd post: http://mikirk.com/gettin-all-bridgy-widget/

=== {{adactio}} ===
* I'm Jeremy Keith, my site is adactio.com
* At the last IWC, I had tags for different sections and created a view
* This camp I created different archives by months, days, and for links
* See: http://adactio.com/archive/
* I added in sparklines for month views
* the sparklines for day views were pretty sparse and looked rubbish
* I left everything as reverse chronological, though I may decide to switch that

=== Jocelyn Simpson ===
* Hi I'm Jocelyn Simpson and my site is http://jocelyn.inturnaround.com
* I figured out how to put some categories into my menu via tags/categories
* I don't have actual content in them yet, but there there
* I also set up to capture emails for my (pending) email newsletter.
* I used mailchimp because it was free and included a simple plugin.

=== Jesus Noland ===
* My website is http://www.JesusNoland.com
* This is my first IndieWeb experience.
* I got h-card working
* I also learned about web sign in and managed to log into the wiki and make edits
* I used a <link> tag on my website so it's hidden

=== Sevil Turner ===
* My name is Sevil Turner and my website is at http://www.sevilturner.com
* I managed to log into the wiki and RSVP to camp this weekend.
* I also created an h-card for my site
* I'm also planning on moving my site to [[Jekyll]] soon

=== Rachel Upshaw ===
* I'm Rachel Upshaw and I'm waiting for my new domain name to propagate so it's live on the internet
* I did start hacking on my site which I'll move to it's final location, but I got most of a representative h-card

=== {{chrisaldrich}} ===
* using android
* opened @t
* wants to own his likes
* shows his Android viewing twitter.com/t (in Twitter app)
* clicks to "share" icon for that tweet
* it goes to a "URL Forwarder" Android App
* it goes to creating a like on his Known
* his Known automatically POSSEs to Twitter
* so now his like shows up on Twitter as well
* the amounts of likes and such I do since this has tripled

=== {{tantek}} ===
* I'm Tantek and my site is Tantek.com
* I got one thing done which has been bothering me for a while
* I had been using google search on my website
* I wanted to see search results in date order, but google seems to have broken this feature.
* for a search box to show 0 results was just awful
* I've been using Duck duck Go as my default in my browser
* I switched to it for my site search now
* Google used to be fast for search and it seems like they backslid
* duckduck go shows emoji in search results
* and google doesn't
* duck duck go also shows author icons in search while google doesn't
* overall it's a better user experience
* google wants to add a lot of javascript just to do a google search
* (gRegorLove: Also in general search, if you click on that icon it changes it to a site-specific search)
* Google search doesn't do timebased search for the past few months
* google doesn't support iso dates either
* Duckduckgo also has an html version of their search and the search result goes directly to the page
* Something has gone wrong with web development engineering compared to 15 years ago and there's no real excuse for it.
* We all benefit for faster websites.

=== Asher Silberman ===
* Hi I'm [http://www.ashersilberman.com/ Asher Silberman] and my site is localhost:8000 (now live on my site http://www.ashersilberman.com)
* I've built in flask using flat files
* I based it on the [https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb Jekyll-indieweb template] I got on the wiki
* I created a sample post and have some links with rel-me

=== {{aaronpk}} ===
* Hi I'm aaronpk (remote via hangouts) and my site is https://aaronparecki.com/
* worked on pubsub.rocks
* I'm going to use the publisher test
* http://pubsub.rocks/publisher
* It delivered the latest version of my homepage though I haven't done anything pretty with it.
* Showing Test your subscriber functionality
* Woodwind.xyz wasn't quite as real-time as I wanted.
* I'm going to use this website to test itself.
* It's nearly instantaneous
* That's the beginning of testing publishers and subscribers.
* aaronpk gets a major round of applause
* aaronpk: it's pretty crazy! I hope that made sense! it's a little hard to wrap your head around
