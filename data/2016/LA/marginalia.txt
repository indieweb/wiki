== Notes ==
Much of the marginalia in IndieWeb was inspired by Kartik's work: https://kartikprabhu.com/articles/marginalia
Which was inspired by Medium.com

{{kevinmarks}} has been working on [[fragmentions]]

{{aaronpk}} has created ids for the URL when selected on http://micropub.net/draft/
* Automatic IDs for all headings, paragraphs, list items with a little inline javascript
Search for <script> that has inline script

Group question: How could one do a fragmention a portion of an image?
* See [[area-tag]]
* and: https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#naming-space

KP: I had a suggestion for an audio marginalia by referring to the time see: https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/gurdy-lights-sky where I refer to an audio post by Barnaby Walters as http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SYMoz#t=42 The "t=42" means the comment is about that "time" in the audio. I don't think Barnaby implemented as display for that though.

Tantek: "What we need are fragmentions for "view source"."
WebNote? -> OneNote

Kartik's script for showing a link icon with fragmention link in response to selecting text:
* https://github.com/kartikprabhu/fragmentioner
 
KP notes on fragmentioner script
* the script does not do anything fancy except create a fragmention URL from the selected text content.
* It does not check if the result uniquely refers to the considered text, and so is not foolproof (suggesstions on doing this are appreceiated).
* it seems to fail on other posts except the marginalia-post, so there is definitely bugs.
