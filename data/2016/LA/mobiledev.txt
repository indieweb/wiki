== Notes ==
* How does it change how you make a website if you can only edit on your mobile phone?

Terminal Emulator

Have a VPS that you develop on, use your device to go into it

Use-case: 12 year old code, with a phone or just an iPod, and nothing else, but wants to create a website

Roadblocks
* Filesystem (could use server)
* Option to make a website
* No view source (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/view-source-mobile/)
* bluetooth keyboard

Options for creating things on mobile:
* Github pages (free)
* mediawiki (requires setup on a server)
* jsbin
* etherpad as text editor
* hyperdev.com

Education

Fear: kid doesn't even know that making a website is an option

Biggest roadblock: ???

Gateways of the past: MySpace textarea

You can edit Wikipedia on mobile

Ipads can edit etherpad also (typed from an iPad)

Need a service or guide

You can't write a piece of software on your phone, for your phone.

But maybe you can create a mobile website on your phone for your phone.

You should be able to run your webserver on your phone

Put all the logic in Javascript

=== Getting Started ===

Trying to do that on mobile - where do you get stuck?

Looks like joining indieweb chat works (from indieweb.org homepage)

Trying domain registration now

Should this be something that domain name registrars provide?

ssh clients for phones
* Prompt (https://www.panic.com/prompt/)
* Mosh https://mosh.org/#getting
Coda is a package that includes prompt
