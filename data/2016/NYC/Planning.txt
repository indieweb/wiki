=== To Do ===
Organizers, feel free to take these tasks and either quickly do them, or claim them (to work on them) and your name in front of the item.
* update the [[2016/NYC]] page to have all the same sections as [[2015/SF]]
* create all other 2016/NYC/ subpages (see [[2015/SF]] for what subpages it has) 
** [[2016/NYC/Demos]] - clone from [[2015/SF/Demos]]
** ... other subpages
* ... add anything else to this list that you think needs to be done before the event!

=== Answers ===
* Are there enough extension cords / power strips for everyone sitting at the tables to  plugin in their laptops?
** Yes.

* Does MozNYC have extension cords, surge protectors, and a screen for presentations in the event space?
** Yes. We have the presentation capabilities in 2 of the conference rooms and one in the main lobby/kitchen area where ~12-15 people can sit around the table and couches.

** 2 medium size rooms (6-8), 
** 2 small rooms (2 people each)

* have sharpies?
** Yes

== Initial Planning ==

----
2016-01 IndieWebCamp NYC.

* Interested:
** {{t}}
** {{bear}}
** {{jedahan}}
** ...
* co-organizers: ...
** {{t}} can help co-organize and be the Mozilla connection to help with hosting
** {{gwg}} willing to try to work with anyone who needs help in the Northeastern United States, and possibly farther afield if sufficient notice.
** ...
* ...

Some date constraints:
* weekends are preferable
* I ({{t}}) can get in-office help thru end of February 2016 for Moz NYC venue, not necessarily after.
* FSa work better for {{gwg}} so we're considering those dates first. But he has nothing scheduled for January/February weekends and would accept any.

Possible dates: (all are Friday…Saturday) Please add your ** +1/0/-1 signature preferences!
* Anything in January or February works for me!
