Session proposer: Mark Matienzo (anarchivist)

Two potential topics:
* What is WebMentions, and how do I get started with it?
* Addressing "weird" use cases for content which are not "posts", "photos", etc "created by a person"?
e.g. items in DPLA: http://dp.la/item/316504aa5a119e17f43898cdc9e0bf4e 
* International Image Interoperability Framework ([[IIIF]]) - image resources, sequences, etc.; use cases around notifications around annotations:

=== What is Webmention used for? ===

* Let site A know that site B is linking to a page/post.
* Start to collect or present that information 
* "If it's on the web, it can be used with Webmentions."
* Before webmentions, there were trackbacks, but they had many issues.  Cf. Pingbacks (see illustration): http://www.trafficgenerationcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pingback-in-comments1-550x493.jpg 
* WebMention spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/ 

=== Are there motivating use cases around attribution/citation? ===

* Looking at @aaronpk's site: http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2016/01/04/2/harry-potter-clock#comments 
* Re: citation: Discusion from IWC 2015 PDX on bibliographic data: http://etherpad.indiewebcamp.com/catalog 
* Bridgy - https://brid.gy/ - proxy/integration layer for other platforms e.g. Twitter, etc.
* Note references in spec with how to deal with JSON
* Mark M talking about IIIF (http://iiif.io) usecases around WebMention:  - see * https://groups.google.com/d/msg/iiif-discuss/CfSzsg0qiRM/o8FMrpk5DAAJ and following messages in the thread

Note conversation between aaronpk and tantek in IRC:

<pre>
14:45 <@tantek> aaronpk: do your /collection posts send webmentions to the things being collected?
14:45 <@aaronpk> yes, just like any other post
14:46 <@tantek> if you receive a webmention to one of your posts that it is in a collection on someone else's site, do you show anything different on that post? like "this post has been placed into N collections?" or "this post was collected into ... "?
14:46 <@aaronpk> nope, I don't know how to tell if a post is in a collection
14:47 <@tantek> how do your /collection posts link to the stuff they collect?
14:47 <@aaronpk> the collection post is an h-entry, and it contains many children which are all h-cite objects
14:48 <@aaronpk> that seems like an okay pattern, i hadn't thought about checking the reverse
