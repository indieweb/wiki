== Emma Hodge ==
* created emmahodge.org
* https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site
* registered with gandi.net
* forked from the blank-gh-site that {{tommorris}} created and put on the indieweb org on github
* renamed the repo to githubuser.github.io
* the index.html contains an h-card with a name
* and a link to Twitter where people should put in their twitter account, already has rel=me
* https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site/network
* using this technique we can get a list of who has forked that page, and help them out
* she edited the Zone File in her gandi.net settings for her domain
* added an A record entry, @ A (IP address from github)
* and we noticed that the TTL was 3 hours, so it took a while to take effect
* meanwhile she also had to create a file called "CNAME" at the root of her static site repo on github with just one line of "emmahodge.org"
* she edited the index.html file and commited it, a few hours later it worked: http://emmahodge.org/

== Tantek Çelik ==
* {{tantek}}, https://tantek.com
* documented some of the techniques we came up with for Device Data Portability as how tos
* [[iPod#How_to]]
* showed the wiki page, and talked through the reasons for it

== Paulo ==
* https://paulbruk.github.io/
* Set up using {{tommorris}}' blank-gh-site

== Tom Morris ==
* {{tommorris}}, http://tommorris.org
* worked on [[checkins]]
* [[private posts]] and [[venues]]
* shows how not-logged in view works with private posts
* private posts don't show up in lists
* and permalinks get a 403
* shows his admin site with venue creation / editing page
* shows a venue permalink
* in his /places/times-square
* each venue can also have a [[Foursquare]] venue ID
* Foursquare API lets you pass along a URL along with a tip
* so if you post tips on your own site, you can [[POSSE]] them to Foursquare and send the permalink to the original as the URL of the tip!
* did a bunch of internationalization work too
* switching laptops

== Benjamin Melançon ==
* demoing Bridget's site
* she got her domain registered
* setup hosting at mayfirst.org
* they do hosting as a cooperative service, members not customers
* http://bridgetharrison.org is up!
* here's the theme from [[Pelican]], called Flex that she's using: https://github.com/mlncn/Flex
* Ben edited couple of things in the theme so the social links are [[rel=me]] links
* and in the footer we have an [[h-card]]

== Mark Matienzo ==
* http://matienzo.org
* added [[h-entry]] markup and [[Webmention]] link rels

== Lara Fischer-Zernin ==
* LaraFZ who is not here right now, registered her own domain name for her project(s) and started setting up a static site on github, as well as experimenting with both WordPress.com and Withknown.com
