'''<dfn>Checkins, Locations, Venues</dfn>''' was a session at [[2016/NYC|IndieWebCamp NYC 2016]].

(lots of stuff from: IRC starting at https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-01-22#t1453498993472 )

Demo: old and new tommorris.org [[checkin]]s.

== Venues ==
* Issues with openstreetmap and derived APIs.
* issues w/ licensing of Foursquare data

== Want ==
Offline (actually async) checkins!

Why? Because:
* not always online (e.g. underground in a subway station without even cell service nevermindwifi)
* do not want to wait for network! most of the time checking into places I've checked in before, therefore *should* be cached.
* minimize distraction from being "present" and present surroundings (politeness, safety etc.)
** should ok to add checkin comments (shouts), stickers etc. later
* "Post(square)" workaround is awkward - sometimes confuses or annoys friends on Swarm/Foursquare.
    
== Tools ==

* http://maps.me/ for iOS and Android - works well offline; can save bookmarks with notes
** can export bookmarks on iOS to email attachment (KMZ), or to any number or sharing sources on Android
** KMZ file could be used to seed a maps database
** possible future IndieWeb project - forking Maps.me iOS/Android apps to use as Swarm-style checkin apps
* "offline foursquare" projects
