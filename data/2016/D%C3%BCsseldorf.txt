The second IndieWebCamp in Düsseldorf (last year IndieWebCamp Germany), but just one of many [[IndieWebCamps]] of course!

<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness every year. But there is still a lot of work to do to help people to understand what “owning your data” actually means at all. To achieve this and help people getting started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Düsseldorf for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, teaching, helping.

Join us during beyond tellerrand in Düsseldorf and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe more importantly – encourage users to own their own content and identities.

Food and drinks during the whole IndieWebCamp available.
