The '''first IndieWebCamp in Nuremberg''', but just one of many [[IndieWebCamps]]!

<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. To grow it and help people gettings started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Nuremberg for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, teaching, helping.

Join us during the [http://nueww.de Nuremberg Web Week 2016] and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe more importantly – encourage users to own their own content and identities.

Watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBuJqm6m5mI video of the demos]!
