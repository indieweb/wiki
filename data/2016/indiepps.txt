aaronpk
* a couple years ago, wrote a flickr backup app that keeps a 100% fidelity version of his flickr account

jj
* now has a homebuilt app that POSSEs photos to flickr and google
* didn't want to handle writing logic for privately sharing subsets of photos to people

micropub media endpoint
* quill now uses a media endpoint to post a photo when you drag a photo to the editor
* quill expects a URL to be returned when it posts a photo, but doesn't care where that URL is

For transparently generating thumbnails on serve, see Will's imageproxy: https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy

aaronpk: I want to consolidate all my media creation into one place: DSLR photos, iPhone photos, screenshots - but, should not be publicly accessible.
* not on my main domain, probably not even on the public internet at all (on a server at home)
* push out a copy to wherever when I want to share it (my website, etc)

Can Mediagoblin do this?

Allowing friends to edit/tag my photos
* flickr has had controls to allow your friends to add tags to photos
* facebook encourages friends to tag people in photos
* how can we encourage this on indieweb sites?
