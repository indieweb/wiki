Archived from notes: http://etherpad.indiewebcamp.com/offline

----
Kyle: Interested in offline first for Woodwind so can read when there's no connection.

airhorner.com: after visiting enough times the service worker promps to "add to home"

see ben.thatmustbe.me/mobilepub for an indieweb example - you  log in wiht micropub
if you'e offline, you can save posts for later, then post them when you're back online

also https://adactio.com/  both of these are indieweb sites that are PWAs. Jeremy caches pages so you can read offline

For a news reading site there is wapo.com/pwa which is a WaPo reader that embeds AMPpages and cacehs with a service worker

it will work on iOS, just not offline

Kyle used Ben's mobilepub, wrote a post offline, saved it, went back online and published (no interactive indication it published), but it did publish: https://kylewm.com/2016/06/testing-offline-posting-during-our-offline-first
