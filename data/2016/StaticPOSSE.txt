**  side file to maintain state to avoid sending outbound webmentions during metadata only regeneration
*** hint: Rakefile can use timestamps to customize build scripts to see if page changed then process outbound webmentions
*** https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io has a Rakefile that can send webmentions based on a cache file that has links in post
