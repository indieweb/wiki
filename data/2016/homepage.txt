'''<dfn>2016 homepage</dfn>''' is a project to refine the IndieWebCamp wiki's homepage or redesign it altogether.

== Why ==
Because we can improve the site homepage! For example, make it responsive and accessible to more [[generations]].

== Non-goals ==
Note: we are not trying to redesign the whole site. Just the homepage and its content.

== Issues ==
Please add any new issues here: 
* https://github.com/indieweb/wiki/issues

Past issues:
* {{gRegor}}: Suggestion: a graphic for "Getting Started" on the homepage could be good - similar size as the heart icon on there. See discussion https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-06-10#t1465582107200
** {{t}} incorporated into https://github.com/indieweb/wiki/issues/29
* {{kartik}}: Suggestion: put "home, getting started, discuss, FAQ, search" in some main navigation bar on the top
** {{t}} "home" is already the logo, getting started & discuss & FAQ are already in the sidebar, search is already on top.  I don't see anything to do here.

== Examples ==
Some examples to look at of nice homepages (ideally of active creator-centric communities)

Community website home pages (that are more than just a single project)
* ... still looking for good examples of such

Project-specific examples of nice homepages:
* http://habariproject.org/en/
** {{t}} This one has some nice appeal without seeming too marketingy.
* http://unhosted.org/
** {{t}} something "off" about it, look very 1990s / geeky
* http://jekyllrb.com/
** {{t}} bit of a mess, too much CLI nonsense to be friendly to [[generations]]
* ...

== Participants ==
If you wish to actively help with this project, please list yourself here and be reasonably (e.g. daily) available on [[IRC]]
* {{t}} - have been copy-editing the homepage (simplifying) and doing some layout/style tweaks for consumability. See [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=historysubmit&diff=29353&oldid=29247 July 4-5 changes] for example.
