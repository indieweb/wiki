== What & Why ==
__TOC__
The [[2016/Nuremberg|IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2016]] on April 16th and 17th was a big success with lots of positive resonance — not least because it was one of the highlight events of the [http://nueww.de Nürnberg Web Week 2016] — so the main sponsor [http://opensuse.org openSUSE] asked if we would like to run another camp during their annual and free [https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16 openSUSE Conference 2016] in June here in Nuremberg. Sure we want! — although it won't be a full blown IndieWebCamp as there's only one day time. :)

We'll start the IndieWeb Hack Day with a ~40 minute introductory talk to quickly onboard all those who have never heard of the IndieWeb movement. Then, until early afternoon, there will be barcamp-like sessions to further introduce and discuss some of the IndieWeb technologies. Finally, a couple of hours are spent on hacking and immediately implementing some of these ideas into your own website — or even start it from scratch if you don't have one already. So don't forget to bring your own laptop!
