== material.cmiscm.com ==
* http://material.cmiscm.com/

New website made entirely in Javascript, wants to have the same look and feel as his own website. Wants to make a website where he can show building websites and webapps. 

Wrote a meteor app using his Atom editor which he loves that automatically runs a site through various validation sites and things like Pagespeed and aggregates the results

== Schramm ==
* http://schrammit.de/

Schrammit.de is my site. My last name is Schramm and I want to call it Let's Schrammit

== Jeena == 
* http://jeena.net/

Demonstrating receiving of likes.

== Voxpelli == 
* http://voxpelli.com/

Primarily worked on getting [[SWAT0]] working but that was too complete, so implemented a local storage page for on my own site [[indie-config]] which everyone can use (like [[SubToMe]] for Indie-Config) 

http://voxpelli.com/demo/indie-config/

== Björn Stierand ==
* https://known.stierand.org

Personal site is https://known.stierand.org, Twitter handle @egoexpress.

Used IFTTT [https://www.ifttt.com] workflows and the Ruby script Sifttter-Redux [https://github.com/bachya/Sifttter-Redux] to create journal entries of everything he does every day (i.e. watched YouTube videos, Foursquare checkins etc.) in DayOne [https://dayoneapp.com].

Forked the Ruby script and used the [[Known]] (http://withknown.com) API to now upload these journal entries to his own Known site instead. Code for this is on https://github.com/egoexpress/sifttter-redux-known.

== Frederic Marx ==
* http://fmarx.com/

Site is fmarx.com. Site was static, and he added webmentions using webmention.herokuapp.com, and implemented a simple service worker so if he goes offline and reloads the page it comes from cache.

== Steffen Rademacker == 
* https://webgefrickel.de

Site is https://webgefrickel.de and tried to get Service Worker running on local system. The hard part is getting the service worker to update its own copy of its script in its cache...tried to receive webmentions.

== Jeremy Keith ==
* https://adactio.com/

Yesterday, there was a discussion about homepages and how silos show your history. Something he liked was sparklines, and thought it was fun to do that on his own site.

== Tantek ==
* http://tantek.com/

Made [[homepage]] improvements inspired by yesterday’s session on homepage designs.

Added icons for organizations in a list, and a more link in the tagline which gets you down to the longer description in a narrow window size. This technique is apparently called responsive content.

== Aaron Parecki ==
* http://aaronparecki.com/

Wanted to work on homepage design but didn't. Found bugs. Fixed bugs. Had umlauts error. Hacked up an Indieweb [[reader]] on IRC. If he types !like in IRC, it makes a [[like]] post on his site.

== Barnaby Walters == 
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/

Tried to do a Pure Data [[Micropub]] client, but it didn't work. But he can post a note with <audio> so people can listen live on his website, after which the note is updated with the saved file of the stream.

== Tantek 2 ==
* http://tantek.com/

I have updated [[webmention]] support, based on http://webmention.rocks tests

To debug this I updated my [[Falcon]] posting tool to show me what webmention endpoints it will send webmentions to.

The server does all the webmentions synchronously, so hopefully it completes before the browser times out 

== Bea David ==
* http://justonestep.de/

Uses [[Processwire]], setup site with a plugin developed last year that receives and shows [[webmention]]s, e.g. see:
* https://justonestep.de/notes/20160416-1417/

== Pelle Wessman 2 ==
* https://github.com/voxpelli

there are some exotic webmention types, and it an be hard to get people to send you webmentions

I built node-webmention-testpinger to send you webmentions to test your webmention implementation

if you can add examples of your site's markup when you send webmentions to https://github.com/voxpelli/node-webmention-testpinger others can test 

== Michael Bishop ==
* http://miklb.com

I got my site http://miklb.com set up on [[Jekyll]] using https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb 

== Tinker Tom ==
* http://www.webrocker.de

I updated my site http://www.webrocker.de with a [[service worker]] so it now works [[offline]] as well

== Tantek 3 ==
* http://tantek.com/

During the demo's I updated my posts on http://tantek.com/ to include the indie-config [[webaction]] polyfills. I had to change the [[Content Security Policy]] for it to work (documented on wiki).

== Pelle Wessman 3 ==
* http://voxpelli.com/

Demoing Tantek's webaction support, I can go to a post on his page, and click "Like" or "Reply", and instead of opening up in Twitter, it opens up in the webaction handler of my choice for my site, which in this case is [[Quill]] where I can like or reply and it posts directly to my site instead of Twitter!
