<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Upcoming</dfn>''', also known as <dfn>Upcoming.org</dfn> was (perhaps) the first social [[event]] sharing [[silo]], then acquired and shutdown by [[Yahoo]], and is now in the process of being recreated, currently open source on github at https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming-www</span>.

== Return of Upcoming ==
* Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/the-return-of-upcomingorg/
* Github: https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming
** site: https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming-www

In particular see and add to:
* [https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming/wiki/Use-Cases-and-Feature-Requests Use Cases and Feature Requests]
* [https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming/wiki/IndieWeb-Events IndieWeb Events]

== Brainstorming ==
What's the best approach to take with Upcoming.org beyond just asking them to be indieweb [[friendly]]?

* Enable [[rsvp]] to IndieWeb events for users with no IndieWeb-sites – thus creating a natural fallback action that can be used in [[Webactions]]
* If the new Upcoming.org has a [[follow]] functionality, then make it possible to follow IndieWeb users/sources through that functionality as well
* Be able to submit events to Upcoming.org like one can do to [[IndieNews]] – using [[Webmention]] and u-category. Either have it just submit in general or perhaps also to specific tags by adding specific Upcoming.org tag URL:s
* Allow for IndieWeb [[rsvp]] to Upcoming.org events and have [[Webactions]] on Upcoming.org to make them easier and/or allow creating an IndieWeb [[rsvp]] on ones own site over [[Micropub]], or [[PESOS]]:ing one. Same for eg. [[favorite]] and other [[interactions]] that may be supported

== 2013 Site Death ==
2013-04-30 Upcoming was shut down by parent company Yahoo, one of many [[site-deaths#2013|2013 site deaths]], redirecting all upcoming.yahoo.com URLs to the yahoo.com home page.

== Domain Return and Archive Links ==
In 2014, Yahoo sold the original Upcoming.org domain name back to found Andy Baio who set it up with a Kickstarter (successfully funded), and started linking old upcoming.org event and user profile URLs to Archive.org copies.

This saga is documented in Andy Baio's post on [[Medium]]:
* [https://medium.com/message/587479c215f4 Diary of a Corporate Sellout: The rise and fall and rise of Upcoming.org]

Example URLs with archive.org links on their new upcoming.org 404 pages:
* http://upcoming.org/event/72306/
* http://upcoming.org/user/6623/

Some Upcoming events lack archive.org links, perhaps because they were created after Upcoming became a subdomain of Yahoo.com:
* http://upcoming.org/event/4521748/
** This Upcoming event was a syndication of the original event page at microformats.org, a manual [[POSSE]] of sorts:
** http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2009-09-23-weekly-dinner-sf

As Baio rebuilds and redeploys Upcoming.org, it's likely that all the above Upcoming.org URLs will all work directly to serve their old content (i.e. without requiring clicking through to an archive.org page).
