'''<dfn>iMessage</dfn>''' is a [[messaging]] service by [[Apple]] on [[iOS]] and [[MacOS]] platforms.

== Exporting ==
You can export your iMessages using this open source tool on your MacOS computer
* https://github.com/aaronpk/iMessage-Export

Details:
* if you sign in to your imessage account on a computer it'll sync all the messages to it
* leave a laptop running at home that's acting just as a backup of imessages

MacOS app in default 10.8 install[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messages_(application)#10.8_Mountain_Lion]:
* it's just called "messages"

If you don't use messages on MacOS, you can use this extract iMessages from iPod/iPhone backup on your computer:

== Criticism ==
=== Hides local messages if logged out ===
If for some reason you're logged out of iMessage / [[AppleID]], iMessage forces you to login to see local messages, you are unable to cancel and view local messages without logging in.

This is particularly frustrating because the login it depends on, AppleID, is much less reliable than either [[Facebook]] Messenger or [[Google]] Hangouts logins.

=== Unreliable Delivery ===
iMessage sometimes has silent delivery failures, where it fails, but does not inform the sender that delivery failed.
