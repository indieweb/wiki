'''<dfn>likes</dfn>''' are sometimes part of the information about a [[post]] displayed on the post itself, sometimes in a [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]], like a total number [[like]] responses, icons of recent likers, or even a datetime ordered list of likes.
* See '''[[like]]''' for how to and examples of individual like posts themselves!

== Why ==
By displaying a summary of likes of your post, you show that there are (and can be more) some light interaction with your post. It also shows immediate feedback to those that have responded to your posts with their own indie like [[responses]].

== How to ==

=== How to display ===
There are many methods for displaying the likes under a post, including:
* [[facepile]]
* chronologically inline with all the other [[responses]] ([[Tumblr]] style)
* chronologically listed within a group of just likes, which may come before/after chronological response-type-specific clustering such as comments, reposts. ([[Known]] / {{benwerd}} does this on werd.io)

In all such methods, consider linking from the specific face or chronological response item to the permalink of the respective indie like of your post.

If you are showing silo likes of POSSE copies of your posts, from silos that lack permalinks for such like posts / responses, then you may link them to the user liking your post as a fallback.

=== How to de-duplicate ===
If you [[POSSE]] a post to a silo, then it is possible that someone posting an indie [[like]] of your post will also POSSE their like to that silo, thus resulting your post seemingly seeing two likes from the same one like from that person. Examples:
* http://werd.io/2015/if-you-care-about-owning-your-own-space-on-the
* https://kylewm.com/2015/06/yes-https-is-more-work-to-support-than-http-so-let

Since those likes represent only a single actual liking action (the liking of the POSSE copy is just a mirroring of that action to a silo for silo-only readers to see), your post should de-duplicate any such likes of POSSE copies of your posts, and show only a single like, no matter what your display design is for likes.

Duplicate likes can also happen if you POSSE to more than one silo and one person likes your post in more than one silo. In that case, consider preserving all of them, and maybe cluster them, but don't de-dupe. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-06-18#t1434663182703 There's no consensus yet though.] Up to you!

You can de-duplicate likes by looking for the indie like of your post to explicitly have a like-of link to the POSSE copy of your post, and if such, you know you can count that like of the POSSE copy as a duplicate (and do not need to display it).

Alternatively, you can fetch the user's [[h-card]] on their site, look for [[rel-me]] links, and use those to de-dupe based on the h-card in the backfed silo like (aka POSSE copy).

When you detect such duplicate likes on silo copies of your posts, you should prefer and show only the indie like on your likes display on your post.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are a few IndieWeb sites which receive and handle [[webmentions]] for [[like]] posts and display them in various ways (as a [[facepile]], as a list, mixed in with other interactions like [[reposts]] and [[comments]]).

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} uses [[Known]] to display a chronological list of likes of a post, between similar chronological lists of [[comments]] and [[reshares]], since 20??-??-??. Examples:
* http://werd.io/2015/if-you-care-about-owning-your-own-space-on-the
** indie like of that post: http://tantek.com/2015/168/f1

{{kylewm}} uses [[Redwind]] to display a facepile of likes under each post since 20??-??-??. Example:

** indie like of that post: http://tantek.com/2015/169/f1

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] to display a facepile of likes under each post since 20??-??-??. Example:

=== Pelle Wessman ===
{{voxpelli}} uses [[webmention.herokuapp.com]] to display a realtime facepile of likes under each post on his blog since [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/commit/175a0cf460e3f3d865a6166e5bf7b2a924139b8d 2014-12-30]. [[webmention.herokuapp.com]] can also show likes mixed with the rest of the responses when facepiles has been opted out of. Examples:

* Facepiles: https://voxpelli.com/2014/10/indie-config-overview/
* No facepiles: https://voxpelli.com/mentions/

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} uses [[Kirby]] with his own take on the [https://github.com/sebsel/seblog-kirby-webmentions webmentions plugin] to display likes and other interactions under his posts. Displays as a [[facepile]] with a heart-icon.
Example: 
* https://seblog.nl/2016/11/30/4/hwc-amsterdam-schiphol-first


=== {{gwg}} ===
{{gwg}} uses [[WordPress]] and the Semantic Linkbacks plugin to display likes and other interactions under his posts. In the past, he did have a Facepile. But currently, likes are displayed in comment form until further notice.

== Silo Examples ==
[[Silos]] such as [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] show the number of likes on posts in various ways:
=== Facebook ===
"üëç so-and-so and nn others liked this"

* inline space/comma separated list of linked usernames/fullnames for some number of likes below a threshold number.
* inline comma separated list of linked fullnames followed by "and 84 others like this" text, where "84" is the remaining number of likes and is linked to a modal popup that displays a list. - Facebook

=== Instagram ===
"17 likes" - for 11(?) or more likes.

* inline space/comma separated list of linked usernames/fullnames for some number of likes below a threshold number.
