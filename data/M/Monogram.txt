{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Monogram</dfn>''' is an idea for minimal [[Micropub]] client and minimal service that allows you to have one of everything: one post, one like, one reply, one follow, and taking one of those actions replaces the previous one in the service.

== Features ==
* [[Micropub]] support: if you enable Micropub support, then Monogram acts like a client and lets you post any of those things to your website, but itself only keeps the most recent post, like, reply, follow in the app itself.

== History ==
Originally discussed at [[2016|IndieWeb Summit 2016]] and [[2017/Austin|IndieWebCamp Austin 2017]] and subsequently brought up in chat many times with comments that we should document it on the wiki.
