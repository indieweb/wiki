{{stub}}

<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Monogram</dfn>''' is an idea for minimal [[Micropub]] client that allows you one of everything: one photo, one like, one follow, etc. Originally discussed at [[2017/Austin|IndieWebCamp Austin 2017]] and subsequently brought up in chat many times with comments that we should document it on the wiki.</span>
