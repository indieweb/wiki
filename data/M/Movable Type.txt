'''<dfn>[http://movabletype.com Movable Type]</dfn>''' is proprietary blogging software written in Perl and originally released in 2001.

== Examples ==
A few, very active 10+ year old blogs use Movable Type, e.g.,

* http://daringfireball.net/
* https://www.antipope.org/charlie

This makes it an interesting case study for [[longevity]]. 

Movable Type was briefly open source for versions 4 and 5. This created a fork called OpenMelody but sadly as of 2014 it appears to be stagnant and as of 2024 is difficult to run on a modern Linux installation because of old Perl scripts that don't work with modern Perl. As of version 6, the open source license option was removed.

== Previous uses ==

* https://www.dashes.com/anil (now uses Eleventy)
* https://waxy.org/ (now uses WordPress)
* http://codinghorror.com (now uses Ghost)

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
The above sites are all "independent" even "indieweb" by at least some [[IndieMark]] measure.

However, no one active in the indiewebcamp community currently uses Movable Type.

Would be great to get one or more the above examples involved in the community!

== Database and Static Files ==
<blockquote>Movable type is interesting in the database debate. It uses a database, but renders all pages to static files by default. So sites made with it tend to be less fragile and persist longer</blockquote>

== FAQ ==
=== Movable Type Outreach ===
Q: Do we have a moveable type outreach group? (Possible candidate? http://sixcolors.com/2014/12/powered-by-movable-type/ )

A: Not at the moment, as we don't even have any indieweb community members using Movable Type to do the outreaching (in contrast to the [[WordPress Outreach Club]]).
