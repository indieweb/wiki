{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://matrix.org Matrix]</dfn>''' is an open protocol for real-time communications ("chat"). Matrix is federated, supports E2E-encryption (both for 1-to-1 and group chats), and bridges to many other chat protocols are available (see [[discuss]] for how to access the indieweb chat rooms through Matrix).

Matrix is described as:

<blockquote>
Matrix is an open source project that publishes the [https://matrix.org/docs/spec/ Matrix open standard] for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed [https://github.com/matrix-org reference implementations].

Maintained by the non-profit [https://matrix.org/foundation Matrix.org Foundation], they aim to create an open platform which is as independent, vibrant and evolving as the Web itself... but for communication.

As of June 2019, Matrix is out of beta, and the protocol is fully suitable for production usage.

== Developer Resources ==

* {{sknebel}} has used the [[Python]] [https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio matrix-nio] library and the [https://github.com/anoadragon453/nio-template nio-template] to build [[chatbot]]s for Matrix
** even when using those libraries the specifications can be needed: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/#matrix-apis
* see [[chatbot]] for ideas for integration with an Indieweb site.

== Criticism ==

* {{petermolnar}} had given self-hosting a Matrix server many chances, both with [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse synapse] and with [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/dendrite dendrite]; both of them are horribly resource hungry, eg. at 2021-12-06 with the current up to date dendrite I tried to join #indieweb:libera.chat; after 20 minutes the process was consuming 11GB residual memory and I still wasn't in the room, at which point I had to kill my matrix server because it was about to crash my system.
* {{petermolnar}} all the clients are too flashy and disturbingly resource hungry, just like the self-hosted servers
