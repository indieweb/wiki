'''<dfn>[http://matrix.org Matrix]</dfn>''' is an open protocol for real-time communications.

Matrix is described as:

<blockquote>
Matrix is an open source project that publishes the [https://matrix.org/docs/spec/ Matrix open standard] for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed [https://github.com/matrix-org reference implementations].

Maintained by the non-profit [https://matrix.org/foundation Matrix.org Foundation], they aim to create an open platform which is as independent, vibrant and evolving as the Web itself... but for communication.

As of June 2019, Matrix is out of beta, and the protocol is fully suitable for production usage.
