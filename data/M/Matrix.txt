'''<dfn>[https://matrix.org/ Matrix]</dfn>''' is an open protocol for real-time communications ("chat") that was previously bridged to the [[discuss|IndieWeb chat]], but Libera disabled 2023-08-06.[https://matrix.org/blog/2023/08/libera-bridge-disabled/][https://libera.chat/news/temporarily-disabling-the-matrix-bridge] Matrix is federated, supports E2E-encryption (both for 1-to-1 and group chats), and bridges to many other chat protocols are available.

Matrix is described as:

<blockquote>
Matrix is an open source project that publishes the [https://matrix.org/docs/spec/ Matrix open standard] for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed [https://github.com/matrix-org reference implementations].

Maintained by the non-profit [https://matrix.org/foundation Matrix.org Foundation], they aim to create an open platform which is as independent, vibrant and evolving as the Web itself... but for communication.

As of June 2019, Matrix is out of beta, and the protocol is fully suitable for production usage.

== Features ==
(this section is a stub, feel free to summarize only IndieWeb-relevant features, and link to Wikipedia for the rest)

Matrix protocol has the following features:
* [[federation]]
* ... 

== IndieWeb Examples ==

<del>The IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] channels are bridged to Matrix via IRC.</del> The bridge to libera.chat was disabled in August 2023: https://libera.chat/news/matrix-bridge-disabled-retrospective


== Developer Resources ==

* {{sknebel}} has used the [[Python]] [https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio matrix-nio] library and the [https://github.com/anoadragon453/nio-template nio-template] to build [[chatbot]]s for Matrix
** even when using those libraries the specifications can be needed: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/#matrix-apis
* see [[chatbot]] for ideas for integration with an Indieweb site.

== Criticism ==
=== servers resource intensive ===
* {{petermolnar}}: I've given self-hosting a Matrix server many chances, both with [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse synapse] and with [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/dendrite dendrite]; both of them are horribly resource hungry, eg. at 2021-12-06 with the current up to date dendrite I tried to join #indieweb:libera.chat; after 20 minutes the process was consuming 11GB residual memory and I still wasn't in the room, at which point I had to kill my matrix server because it was about to crash my system. Yes, I did try it with the SQLite backend, and not with the recommended Postgres backend, but it's one single freakin' room.
=== clients resource intensive ===
* {{petermolnar}} all the clients are too flashy and disturbingly resource hungry, just like the self-hosted servers

** "I should love Matrix. It is a decentralised, privacy preserving, multi-platform chat tool. Goodbye Slack and your ridiculous free limits. Adiós Discord and your weird gamification. Suck it IRC with your obscure syntax and faint stench of BO. WhatsApp and Telegram can stick their heads in a bucket of lukewarm sick and sing sea shanties! Let's join the future!The problem is - Matrix is shit. Not just on a protocol level, but on an organisational level as well.I joined Matrix at FOSDEM - the largest gathering of open source nerds in Europe. We were all encouraged to use it - every talk had its own channel, all the official comms came from there, I was even invited to a top-secret private channel for speakers. This was going to be epic! Viva la rèvölūçïón, right? Wrong.It was dead. Even among the most seasoned geeks on the planet, most people preferred to use other services like Signal, Telegram, and Slack. Why? Because those other tools actually work.Matrix has two official Android apps - one of which is old and unsupported, the other is new and doesn't work with many of the basic chat features.I want to be absolutely clear about this - the company behind Matrix have put out an app which doesn't work with their own product!  Lest you think I'm exaggerating, here's a typical view of the official FOSDEM speaker room, using the official Matrix app:It was embarrassing. People would pipe up in channels and say "this doesn't work" only to be told they were using the wrong app and should go back to the one marked unsupported. So they left, never to return. Even in the large talks, where people were encouraged to use the official Matrix chat, most of the conversation happened on other platforms. It was just too hard to use Matrix.A few thousands geeks, all used to recompiling their own kernels and participating in the Fediverse, and most thought that Matrix was too much of a faff.After FOSDEM, I kept the Matrix app on my phone. Occasionally receiving a ping from some long-forgotten channel.And then, one day, I got hit with the most vile spam. A dozen notifications suddenly appeared on my phone with abuse, torture, and transphobic slurs in them.You can view the screenshot - but, fair warning, it is grim.This shouldn't be possible. It doesn't take an expensive team of moderators to add some keyword monitoring. It doesn't take a massive AI model to work out that a stranger shouldn't be able to bombard users with multiple notifications. You don't have to sacrifice your dream of a decentralised future - you just need to care about your users.This stuff is basic.I moaned about it on Mastdon and was surprised to receive a private reply from the official Matrix account.Please do not encourage the spammer by giving them a platform and propagating their spam; you may want to consider deleting your post.This is classic victim blaming. It is my fault for giving the spammer attention. I am the one who needs to take responsibility and delete the evidence. I shouldn't warn people that Matrix is actively dangerous to use.Bullshit.Here's what I expected them to say:"We're sorry you had such a bad experience on Matrix. Rest assured we're working hard to block these spammers - here's a link to show what we're doing. You can protect your account further by doing x, y and z. Once again, sorry and we hope we can win back your trust."I'm not saying scrappy open source projects have to hire anodyne corporate communications specialists; they just need to have a little empathy.But, no, just constant whining about how it isn't their fault and how I am the one who needs to change my behaviour.This is pretty typical behaviour from the team. Find any post complaining about some aspect of Matrix and you'll see their instant woe-is-me replies.So I deleted the app. I would have liked to have nuked my account but apparently that's not possible.I'm not the only one who feels like this. Here's an epic post by Marius, which concludes:Between the slow performance, the increasing amount of spam, the miserable web client, and the unfinished state of Element X, the Matrix.org network is not something I am willing to continue to recommend, especially to non-technical users. Normal people are simply tolerating it to communicate with idealistic nerds like myself who insist(ed) on using it.Matrix just isn't focussed on users. I'm not talking about user-experience tweaks like which shade of cornflower blue to use - I mean basic user needs like apps that work and a way to combat spam.There's a long list of ways the protocol contributes to a poor user experience. It almost seems designed without regard for how it will actually be used.While the protocol may be conceptually interesting and their intentions noble, I'm not prepared to suffer abuse in the name of technical purity.Open Source and Open Standards nerds like me ought to know by now that the protocol is the least compelling thing about a service.  Who cares if your home is built using only Stallman-blessed tools, when the walls are full of rats?" [https://shkspr.mobi/blog/@blog @blog] July 29, 2025
