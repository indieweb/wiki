'''<dfn>[https://developer.mozilla.org Mozilla Developer Network]</dfn>''' is a web development resource with detailed overviews, tutorials, reference guides on various subjects from HTML to HTTP headers.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* MDN has a [[microformats]] page that introduces readers to microformats and how to start using them: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats.

== Brainstorming ==

=== Contributions ===

{{capjamesg}}, {{t}} and edgeduchess had a discussion about contributing IndieWeb guides to MDN on January 28, 2021. Explaining what these contributions would achieve, edgeduchess said:

<blockquote>For the usage, I consult MDN a lot when I'm implementing anything. For example, if I were implementing Webmentions for my blog and saw a MDN link, that's the first thing I would click on.
First of all cause I can trust that MDN explanations are usually good and to the point, providing a nice, understandable overview. But also, because if something is on MDN I know I can trust it as a standard.</blockquote>

After being prompted about how to make potential MDN contributions distinct from what we already have on the IndieWeb and/or microformats wiki, {{t}} said:

<blockquote>MDN: very focused web developer perspective brief definition, use-cases, and how-to, with very good copywriting / copyediting, no "messy" or "unstructured" / in-progress content, and links to the official spec (on microformats wiki) and the IndieWeb community "discussion" page as well</blockquote>

==== Advantages ====

Contributing IndieWeb tutorials to MDN may help us raise awareness for the stable standards that we are using in the community such as Webmentions and IndieAuth.

==== Starting Points ====

{{capjamesg}} has volunteered to write a guide for MDN on Webmentions. This guide would touch on:

* What is webmentions?
* Why should you use webmentions on a website?
* How to start receiving webmentions
* How to start sending webmentions
* Where to learn more

Other good starting points include:

* IndieAuth
* Micropub
* add more...
