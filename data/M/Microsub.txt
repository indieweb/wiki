'''<dfn>Microsub</dfn>''' provides a standardized way for [[reader]] apps to interact with feeds. By splitting feed parsing and displaying posts into separate parts, a reader app can focus on presenting posts to the user instead of also having to parse feeds. A Microsub server manages the list of people you're following and collects their posts, and a Micropub app shows the posts to the user by fetching them from the server.

{{main|Microsub-spec}}

Microsub enables a client to show posts from feeds across the web and display them in a [[reader]], without having to do any feed parsing itself. With Microsub, people can use any suitable reader to follow and read the content. Decoupling the idea of displaying posts from actually fetching remote feeds makes it simpler to build a reader, as well as makes your subscription list portable between readers.

Reader apps can also use [[Micropub]] to respond to content the user is following, for example with a [[like]], a [[repost]] or a [[comment]].

Microsub decouples managing subscriptions and delivering content from the presentation of that content. The Microsub server handles the actual subscription to feeds, (likely using [[WebSub]]), while providing a consistent API so that apps can present the contents of the feeds in a [[reader]] interface.

A short verbal discussion of what it does can be heard [https://percolator.today/media/Episode_17.mp3#t=53 here] on {{aaronpk}}'s Percolator podcast

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{aaronpk}} uses [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Together]] and [[Indigenous]] clients.
** https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} uses a self-hosted [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Indigenous for iOS]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients.
** {{martymcguire}} uses an identical setup since 2018-03-05.
* {{realize.be}} uses an account on {{aaronpk}}'s Aperture instance and the [[Indigenous for Android]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients
* {{pstuifzand}} uses [[Monocle]], [[Indigenous]] and [[Together]] with his own microsub-server.
* {{addyourself}}

== Clients ==

=== Monocle ===
[[Monocle]] is an in-development Microsub reader web app built by {{aaronpk}}. If you have a Microsub server, you can use the hosted version at https://monocle.p3k.io

== Servers ==
* {{aaronpk}} is building [[Aperture]], a Microsub server with no UI for rendering posts. This is intended to be a server only, and all rendering will happen using Microsub clients. [https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture source on Github]
* {{sknebel}} is building a bridge from [[Inoreader]] â€¯to Microsub (not ready yet, sorry!)
* {{pstuifzand}} is building a microsub-server [https://github.com/pstuifzand/microsub-server source on Github]
