'''<dfn>Microsub</dfn>''' provides a standardized way for [[reader]] apps to interact with [[feeds]]. By splitting feed parsing and displaying posts into separate parts, a reader app can focus on presenting posts to the user instead of also having to parse feeds. A Microsub ''server'' manages the list of people you're following and collects their posts, and a Microsub ''app'' shows the posts to the user by fetching them from the server.
* Want to implement a Microsub client or server? See '''[[Microsub-spec|the Microsub specification]]'''.
__TOC__
Microsub enables a client to show posts from feeds across the web and display them in a [[reader]], without having to do any feed parsing itself. With Microsub, people can use any suitable reader to follow and read the content. Decoupling the idea of displaying posts from actually fetching remote feeds makes it simpler to build a reader, as well as makes your subscription list portable between readers.

Reader apps can also use [[Micropub]] to respond to content the user is following, for example with a [[like]], a [[repost]] or a [[comment]].

Microsub decouples managing subscriptions and delivering content from the presentation of that content. The Microsub server handles the actual subscription to feeds, (likely using [[WebSub]]), while providing a consistent API so that apps can present the contents of the feeds in a [[reader]] interface.

A short verbal discussion of what it does can be heard [https://percolator.today/media/Episode_17.mp3#t=53 here] on {{aaronpk}}'s Percolator podcast

[[File:monocle-timeline-view.png|600px]]

=== Together ===
[[Together]] a web based Microsub reader, primarily developed by {{grantcodes}}. Source code at [https://github.com/alltogethernow/web/ https://github.com/alltogethernow/web/] and an online at [https://alltogethernow.io https://alltogethernow.io]

[[File:together-screenshot-2019-06-19.jpg|600px]]

=== Ekster Reader ===

Ekster Reader is an in-development Microsub reader, running in a browser. It connects directly to a Microsub server without its own Microsub proxy backend. For this to work you do need a Microsub server that handles CORS headers, to allow access from the browser. This also applies for the Indieauth endpoint. A version is hosted at https://reader.p83.nl/

=== Microsub Notifier ===

[[microsub notifier]] is a Microsub client built purely to send notifications of new content in any of your Microsub channels. Built by {{grantcodes}} is is hosted at https://microsub-notifier.tpxl.io

(needs screenshots!)

== Servers ==
* [[Aperture]], built by {{aaronpk}}, is a Microsub server with no UI for rendering posts. This is intended to be a server only, and all rendering happens using Microsub clients. It is built in PHP with MySQL storage. [https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture Source on Github]
* The [https://drupal.org/project/indieweb Drupal IndieWeb] module, built by {{realize.be}} includes a built-in Microsub server.
* [[dobrado]] includes a Microsub server, built by {{mblaney}}
* [[Micro.blog]] can be used as a Microsub server. Channels are mapped to the built-in sections of Micro.blog like Timeline, Mentions, and Favorites.
* [[Yarns]] is a plugin to run a Microsub server from your WordPress site, built by {{jackjamieson}}. It uses the [https://github.com/dshanske/parse-this Parse This] library built by {{GWG}}. It has a UI for managing channels and subscriptions. 
* [[Ekster]], built by {{pstuifzand}}, is a Microsub server in Go using a Redis storage. [https://github.com/pstuifzand/ekster Source on Github]


Proxies - not entire server(s), but implements Microsub server API wrapped around existing service(s):
* [https://baffle.tech/ Baffle], built by {{snarfed}}, is a bridge that makes traditional feed readers like [[NewsBlur]] and [[Feedly]] support Microsub. [https://snarfed.org/microsub-bridge More background]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} uses [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Together]] and [[Indigenous]] clients.
** https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} uses a self-hosted [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Indigenous for iOS]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients.
** {{martymcguire}} uses an identical setup since 2018-03-05.
* {{realize.be}} uses the built-in Microsub server of the Drupal Indieweb module and the [[Indigenous for Android]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients
* {{doubleloop}} uses an account on {{aaronpk}}'s Aperture instance and the [[Indigenous for Android]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients since 2018-09-07
* {{pstuifzand}} uses [[Monocle]], [[Indigenous]], [[Together]] and Ekster Reader with his own microsub-server, [[Ekster]]. 
* {{addyourself}}

=== In Progress ===

* {{jackjamieson}} is building a WordPress plugin called Yarns Microsub Server. [https://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server Source on Github]
* {{sebsel}} is working on a project codenamed Leesmap, as described on [https://seblog.nl/2018/10/22/13/three-things-about-readers this post on Seblog.nl]
* {{jackyalcine}} is working on a Microsub client + server called [[Lwa]]

== Getting Started ==

To use a Microsub app, your website will need to support [[IndieAuth]] and advertise a Microsub endpoint. Starting with a plain HTML home page, the steps below will walk you through getting set up so you can log in to an IndieWeb reader app.

=== Setting up IndieAuth ===
If you have WordPress or another website that has native IndieAuth support, that is your best option. Install the IndieAuth plugin in WordPress or your CMS.

If you are not using a CMS that has native IndieAuth support, you can use the steps below to delegate all the authentication to external services so that you can use it with a static site or any other project.

* add a rel=me link to your GitHub profile
** e.g. <code><nowiki><a href="https://github.com/username" rel="me">username</a> on github</nowiki></code>
* add the following tags to delegate your [[IndieAuth]] handling to indieauth.com
** <code><nowiki><link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth"></nowiki></code>
** <code><nowiki><link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token"></nowiki></code>

=== Setting up Microsub ===
* sign in to https://aperture.p3k.io/login with your domain
** after you sign in you will see a link tag displayed on your dashboard
* add the <link> tag it generates for you to your web page
** e.g. <code><nowiki><link rel="microsub" href="https://aperture.p3k.io/microsub/000"></nowiki></code>
* sign in to an IndieWeb reader! 
** https://monocle.p3k.io
** https://alltogethernow.io
** [[Indigenous]]
