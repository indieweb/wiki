'''<dfn>Microsub</dfn>''' is an early draft of a spec that provides a standardized way for clients to consume and interact with feeds collected by a server.

{{main|Microsub-spec}}

Microsub decouples managing subscriptions and delivering content from the presentation of that content. The Microsub server handles the actual subscription to feeds, (likely using [[WebSub]]), while providing a consistent API to clients for presentation in a [[reader]] interface.

If your website is compatible with Microsub, then you can use any Microsub client to read your timeline and follow people.

Decoupling the idea of displaying posts from actually fetching remote feeds makes it simpler to build a [[reader]] client.
