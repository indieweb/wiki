'''<dfn>Microsub</dfn>''' is an early draft of a spec that provides a standardized way for clients to consume and interact with feeds collected by a server.

{{main|Microsub-spec}}

Microsub decouples managing subscriptions and delivering content from the presentation of that content. The Microsub server handles the actual subscription to feeds, (likely using [[WebSub]]), while providing a consistent API to clients for presentation in a [[reader]] interface.

If your website is compatible with Microsub, then you can use any Microsub client to read your timeline and follow people.

Decoupling the idea of displaying posts from actually fetching remote feeds makes it simpler to build a [[reader]] client.

A short verbal discussion of what it does can be heard [https://percolator.today/media/Episode_17.mp3#t=53 here] on {{aaronpk}}'s Percolator podcast

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{aaronpk}} uses [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Together]] and [[Indigenous]] clients.
** https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} uses a self-hosted [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Indigenous for iOS]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients.
* {{realize.be}} uses an account on {{aaronpk}}'s Aperture instance and the [[Indigenous for Android]]
* {{addyourself}}

== Clients ==

=== Together ===
[[Together]] is an in-development Microsub reader. Source code at [https://github.com/cleverdevil/together/ https://github.com/cleverdevil/together/] and an online preview at [https://alltogethernow.io https://alltogethernow.io]

=== Indigenous ===
[[Indigenous]] is a set of in-development native iOS and Android Microsub reader apps.

==== iOS ====
[[Indigenous for iOS]] is a native iOS Microsub reader app built by {{eddiehinkle.com}}

=== Monocle ===
[[Monocle]] is an in-development Microsub reader web app built by {{aaronpk}}. If you have a Microsub server, you can use the hosted version at https://monocle.p3k.io

== Servers ==
* {{aaronpk}} is building [[Aperture]], a Microsub server with no UI for rendering posts. This is intended to be a server only, and all rendering will happen using Microsub clients. [https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture source on Github]
* {{sknebel}} is building a bridge from [[Inoreader]]â€¯to Microsub (not ready yet, sorry!)
