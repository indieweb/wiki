'''<dfn>Microsub</dfn>''' provides a standardized way for [[reader]] apps to interact with feeds. By splitting feed parsing and displaying posts into separate parts, a reader app can focus on presenting posts to the user instead of also having to parse feeds. A Microsub ''server'' manages the list of people you're following and collects their posts, and a Microsub ''app'' shows the posts to the user by fetching them from the server.
* Want to implement a Microsub client or server? See '''[[Microsub-spec|the Microsub specification]]'''.
__TOC__
Microsub enables a client to show posts from feeds across the web and display them in a [[reader]], without having to do any feed parsing itself. With Microsub, people can use any suitable reader to follow and read the content. Decoupling the idea of displaying posts from actually fetching remote feeds makes it simpler to build a reader, as well as makes your subscription list portable between readers.

Reader apps can also use [[Micropub]] to respond to content the user is following, for example with a [[like]], a [[repost]] or a [[comment]].

Microsub decouples managing subscriptions and delivering content from the presentation of that content. The Microsub server handles the actual subscription to feeds, (likely using [[WebSub]]), while providing a consistent API so that apps can present the contents of the feeds in a [[reader]] interface.

A short verbal discussion of what it does can be heard [https://percolator.today/media/Episode_17.mp3#t=53 here] on {{aaronpk}}'s Percolator podcast

[[File:monocle-timeline-view.png|600px]]

=== Together ===
[[Together]] is an in-development Microsub reader. Source code at [https://github.com/cleverdevil/together/ https://github.com/cleverdevil/together/] and an online preview at [https://alltogethernow.io https://alltogethernow.io]

(needs screenshots!)

=== Ekster Reader ===

Ekster Reader is an in-development Microsub reader, running in just your browser. The only the backend it needs is a Microsub server. For this to work you do need a Microsub server the uses CORS headers, to allow access from the browser. Same applies to the Indieauth endpoint. A version is hosted at https://reader.p83.nl/

=== Microsub Notifier ===

[[microsub notifier]] is a Microsub client built purely to send notifications of new content in any of your Microsub channels. Built by {{grantcodes}} is is hosted at https://microsub-notifier.tpxl.io

(needs screenshots!)

== Servers ==
* [[Aperture]], built by {{aaronpk}}, is a Microsub server with no UI for rendering posts. This is intended to be a server only, and all rendering happens using Microsub clients. It is built in PHP with MySQL storage. [https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture Source on Github]
* The [https://drupal.org/project/indieweb Drupal IndieWeb] module, built by {{realize.be}} includes a built-in Microsub server.
* [[dobrado]] includes a Microsub server, built by {{mblaney}}

Proxies - not entire server(s), but implements Microsub server API wrapped around existing service(s):
* [https://baffle.tech/ Baffle], built by {{snarfed}}, is a bridge that makes traditional feed readers like [[NewsBlur]] and [[Feedly]] support Microsub. [https://snarfed.org/microsub-bridge More background]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} uses [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Together]] and [[Indigenous]] clients.
** https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} uses a self-hosted [[Aperture]] as his Microsub server, and the [[Indigenous for iOS]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients.
** {{martymcguire}} uses an identical setup since 2018-03-05.
* {{realize.be}} uses the built-in Microsub server of the Drupal Indieweb module and the [[Indigenous for Android]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients
* {{doubleloop}} uses an account on {{aaronpk}}'s Aperture instance and the [[Indigenous for Android]] (mobile) and [[Monocle]] (on computer) clients since 2018-09-07
* {{pstuifzand}} uses [[Monocle]], [[Indigenous]] and [[Together]] with his own microsub-server, [[Ekster]]. 
* {{addyourself}}

=== In Progress ===
* {{sknebel}} is building a bridge from [[Inoreader]] â€¯to Microsub (not ready yet, sorry!)
* {{pstuifzand}} is building Ekster, a Microsub server in Go using a Redis storage. [https://github.com/pstuifzand/ekster Source on Github]
* {{jackjamieson}} is building a WordPress plugin called Yarns Microsub Server. [https://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server Source on Github]
* {{sebsel}} is working on a project codenamed Leesmap, as described on [https://seblog.nl/2018/10/22/13/three-things-about-readers this post on Seblog.nl]
