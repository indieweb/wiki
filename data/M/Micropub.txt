'''<dfn>Micropub</dfn>''' is an open API standard ([[W3C]] Recommendation) for creating, editing, and deleting posts on websites, like on your own domain, supported by numerous third-party clients, [[CMS]]s, and [[social readers]].

* Latest published version: https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/
* Latest draft: https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/

== Why ==
'''As a user''' the best reason to use Micropub apps is user choice. You choose which Micropub applications you want to use to publish, and separately, which Micropub supporting service or open source software you want to use.

'''As a developer''' there are numerous reasons including:
* '''Test suites.''' Complete client and server test suites: https://micropub.rocks/
* '''Diverse network effects.''' There’s already a diversity of clients and servers for your implementation to interoperate with.
* '''User privacy and security.''' Replace any use of [[MetaWeblog]] or [[AtomPub]] (which depend on password sharing, often in the clear) with [[Micropub]], which is OAuth-based.

== Clients ==
{{main|Micropub/Clients}}

There are a wide variety of apps (web, iPhone, Android) that support Micropub for posting and editing [[article]]s, short [[note]]s, [[reply|comments]], [[like]]s, [[photo]]s, [[event]]s, or other kinds of [[posts]] on your own site.

View the [[Micropub/Clients|Micropub Clients]] main article for a list of sites and client applications that publish via Micropub as well as a table indicating implementation statuses. 

== Servers ==

Examples of Micropub endpoints are listed at [[Micropub/Servers]].


----
The remainder of this page describes highly technical details of Micropub, and is currently written for developers.
----


== Background ==
The Micropub vocabulary is derived directly from the Microformats vocabulary. Micropub is meant to be a serialization of Microformats that can be submitted as an HTTP POST. The method for developing new Micropub vocabularies is to look at the Microformats representation and work backwards.

== Syntax ==
Similar to how [[microformats]] has a relatively small ruleset for parsing HTML documents into a data structure, Micropub defines a small set of rules to interpret HTTP POST and GET requests as Micropub commands. Where Microformats does not require changing the parsing rules to introduce new properties of an object such as an h-entry, Micropub similarly does not require changing parsing rules to interpret requests that may correspond to different post types, such as posting videos vs "likes".

The Micropub syntax describes how to interpret HTTP POST and GET requests into a useful action the server can take.

The full specification can be read at https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/

=== Overview ===

All Micropub requests to create posts are sent as form-encoded[http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#url-encoded-form-data], multipart form-data [http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#multipart-form-data], or JSON encoded HTTP requests. Responses typically do not include a response body, indicating the needed information (such as the URL of the created post) in HTTP headers. When a response body is required, it is returned as either form-encoded or JSON[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159], depending on the HTTP Accept[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2] header.


== How to implement ==
How to implement the Micropub API, both in a client that can discover an endpoint and publish to it, and on a server to support an endpoint to create/update/delete posts in response.

'''Work your way through the test suite and submit an implementation report for Micropub!'''
* Start here: https://micropub.rocks/

=== Endpoint Discovery ===
It should be possible to configure an API client by authenticating as your domain name using IndieAuth. After signing in, your domain needs a way to specify the API endpoint the client will use to create new posts.

Add a &lt;link&gt; tag in the HTML head of your home page, or send an HTTP Link header.

==== HTTP Header ====
<pre>Link: &lt;https://example.com/micropub&gt;; rel="micropub"</pre>

==== HTML Head ====
<pre>&lt;link rel="micropub" href="https://example.com/micropub"&gt;</pre>

=== Authentication ===
Micropub requests are authenticated by including a Bearer Token in either the HTTP header or a form-encoded body parameter as described in the [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2 OAuth Bearer Token RFC].

Authorization should be handled via the IndieAuth protocol, built on top of OAuth 2.0. See [[obtaining-an-access-token]] for more details. An app that wants to post to a user's Micropub endpoint will need to obtain authorization from the user in order to get an access token.

==== HTTP Header ====
<pre>
Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXX
</pre>

==== Form-Encoded Body Parameter ====
<pre>
access_token=XXXXXXXXX
</pre>

=== Scope ===
The client may request one or more scopes during the authorization request. It does this according to standard OAuth 2.0 techniques, by passing a space-separated list of scope names in the authorization request.

The authorization server must indicate to the user any scopes that are part of the request, whether or not the authorization server recognizes the scopes. The authorization server may also allow the user to add or remove scopes that the client requests.

For example, most Micropub servers require clients to obtain the "create" scope in order to create posts. (The legacy "post" scope previously encompassed both creating and updating posts.) However, some servers may require more granular scope requests, such as "delete" or "create:video". See [[scope]] for more details and a list of all currently used values for scope.

=== Verification ===
A micropub client can verify that an access token is still valid (and other details) by querying the user's [[token endpoint]]. 

Issues:

* this does not cover the case where the server has decided not to accept it anymore, e.g. because the user's access to the site has been removed
** if a micropub endpoint plans on rejecting a token in the future, it should ensure the token endpoint also rejects the token. For systems where the token endpoint and micropub endpoint are part of the same software, this is an implementation detail. If the token endpoint and micropub endpoint are on different systems, there needs to be a mechanism for the micropub endpoint to expire the token at the token endpoint. This is what's known as token revocation, and has been written up for OAuth 2: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009

=== Form-encoded Microformats Representation ===
For the simplicity of writing clients and servers, all Micropub endpoints must handle the standard form-encoded format. At a most basic level, you should be able to write an HTML form and set the form action to your own endpoint and use it to post to your site.


=== Examples of Creating Objects ===
How to create some of the common [[:Category:PostType|post types]]

==== Indicating the object being created ====

To indicate the object being created, use a property called "h", (which would never be the name of a property of a microformats object), followed by the name of the microformats object. Examples:

* h=entry
* h=card
* h=event
* h=cite

==== h-entry ====

The following properties may be included in a request to create a new [[h-entry]]:

* name
* summary
* content
* published
* updated
* category = tag1, tag2, tag3 (sent as array syntax: <code>&category[]=tag1&category[]=tag2</code>)
* location
** as a [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870 Geo URI], for example <code>geo:45.51533714,-122.646538633</code>
*** GeoURIs allow [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870#section-6.4 additional parameters] that may be used to include the title of a location: <code>geo:1,2;name=Somewhere</code>
** as a URL that contains an [[h-card]]
** My micropub client currently has a map to mark the specific location in LatLng values, and a text input for an actual place name. So my client is sending a request of the form "&location=1.23,%40-4.56:An%40Address" [[User:Jonnybarnes.net|Jonnybarnes.net]] 07:57, 10 June 2014 (PDT)
* in-reply-to
* repost-of
* syndication
** Pass one or more URLs pointing to places where this entry already exists. Can be used for [[PESOS]] implementations.
* [[mp-syndicate-to]] = <nowiki>https://myfavoritesocialnetwork.example/aaronpk, https://archive.org/</nowiki>, etc.
** This property is slightly different from the others since it is giving a command to the server rather than describing an object, which is why it is prefixed with "mp-".

&category[]=indieweb&category[]=comments
</pre>

===== Adding Files =====

When a Micropub request includes a file, the entire request is sent in the <code>multipart/form-data</code> encoding, and the file is named by content type, either "audio", "video" or "photo". A request may include one or more of these files.

When [[OwnYourGram]] makes a Micropub request to post a video, it also sends a photo which is a thumbnail preview of the video.

In PHP, these files are accessible using the <code>$_FILES</code> array:
 $_FILES['video']
 $_FILES['photo']
 $_FILES['audio']

see also: [[Micropub-brainstorming#Uploading_files_in_separate_requests]]

Note that there is no practical way to upload a file when the request body is JSON encoded. The [[media-endpoint|media endpoint]] needs to be used in that case.

curl example: 

 $ curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer abc'\
        -F 'h=entry'\
        -F 'content=an image!'\
        -F 'photo=@/home/cweiske/Bilder/openid-id.bogo.png'\
        'http://known.bogo/micropub/endpoint'

==== h-event ====

&start=2013-09-30T18:00:00-07:00
&category=indieweb
&location=http://21st-amendment.com/
</pre>


==== h-cite ====

The following properties may be included in a request to create a new [[h-cite]]:

(The following list is from [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-cite#Properties microformats.org/wiki/h-cite])

* name
* published - date of publication of the work (not the date the h-cite was created)
* author - URL of an h-card
* url - a URL to access the cited work
* content - the content or partial content of the work itself, such as when including a blockquote snippet of a work

==== Nested Microformat Objects ====

Whenever possible, nested Microformats objects should be avoided. A better alternative is to reference objects by their URLs. The most common example is including an h-card for a venue, such as checking in to a location or tagging a photo with a person or location. In these cases, it is better to reference the object by URL, creating it first if necessary.

For simple values such as an h-geo property with latitude and longitude, just use a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_URI Geo URI] such as <code>geo:37.786971,-122.399677</code>

This technique has the advantage of ensuring that each object that is created has its own URL (each piece of data has its own link). This also gives the server an opportunity to handle each entity separately. E.g., rather than creating a duplicate of an existing venue, it may give back a link to one that was already created, possibly even merging in newly received data first.

For more complicated objects, it is better to first create an object on the target site so that it has its own URL, then reference that object's URL in the main request.

For example, creating a checkin post would involve two POST requests:

First create the venue by posting an h-card:

<pre>
POST /micropub

h=card
&name=Ford+Food+and+Drink
&url=http://www.fordfoodanddrink.com/
&street-address=2505 SE 11th Ave
&locality=Portland
&region=OR
&postal-code=97214
&geo=geo:45.5048473,-122.6549551
&tel=(503) 236-3023
</pre>

Response:

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://example.com/venue/10
</pre>

Then create the checkin post:

<pre>
POST /micropub

h=entry
&location=http://example.com/venue/10
&name=Working on Micropub
&category=indieweb
</pre>

Response:

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://example.com/entry/1001
</pre>

* This technique has the advantage of ensuring that each object that is created has its own URL (each piece of data has its own link)
* Also gives the server an opportunity to handle each entity separately. E.g., rather than creating a duplicate of an existing venue, it may give back a link to one that was already created, possibly even merging in newly received data first.

=== Handling a micropub request ===
The following error response shorthands are used in this prose implementation guide:

* "Return '''unauthorized'''" means return an HTTP 401 response, optionally with a JSON-encoded '''unauthorized''' error payload as defined [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#error-response here]
* "Return '''forbidden'''" means return an HTTP 403 response, optionally with a JSON-encoded '''forbidden''' error payload as defined [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#error-response here]
* "Return '''invalid_request'''" means return an HTTP 400 response optionally with JSON-encoded '''invalid_request''' error payload as defined [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#error-response here]
* "Return '''insufficient_scope'''" means return an HTTP 403 response, optionally with JSON-encoded '''insufficient_scope''' error payload as defined [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#error-response here]

To handle an HTTP request to a [[micropub-endpoint]]:

* Look for the auth token
** If the request has an <code>Authorization: Bearer</code> header, set '''auth_token''' to the value of the string after <code>Bearer </code>, stripping whitespace.
** Otherwise, if the method is POST and the parsed content of the form-encoded request body contains an '''auth_token''' key, set '''auth_token''' to the value associated with that key.
* If no '''auth_token''' was found, return '''unauthorized'''
* If an '''auth_token''' was found, attempt to verify it. Details are out of the scope of micropub, refer to [[IndieAuth]] for more information.
** If the '''auth_token''' was invalid, return '''forbidden'''
** Otherwise, store the user information associated with the '''auth_token''' for reference later.
* If any [[micropub-extensions]] are supported, detect whether the request is an extension request and handle it appropriately.
* If the request is a GET request, parse the query string into '''query_params'''
** If '''query_params''' contains a '''q''' key, store it under '''q'''
*** If <code>'''q''' == "config"</code>, return a valid JSON-encoded configuration response as defined [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#configuration here]
*** Otherwise, if <code>'''q''' == "source"</code>, check '''query_params''' for a <code>url</code> key.
**** If no '''url''' key exists, or no content identified by '''query_params.url''' exists, return '''invalid_request'''
**** If content identified by '''query_params.url''' exists, but the current '''auth_token''' doesn’t grant the scope to view it, return '''insufficient_scope'''
**** Create an empty list called '''source_properties'''
***** If '''query_params''' contains the key <code>properties</code>, add the value associated under '''query_params.properties''' to '''source_properties'''.
***** Otherwise, if '''query_params''' contains one or more values associated with the key <code>properties[]</code>, add each value to '''source_properties'''
**** Create and return a valid [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#source-content Source Content] response based on the values of '''url''' and '''source_properties'''.
*** Otherwise, if <code>'''q''' == "syndicate-to"</code>, return a valid JSON-encoded [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#syndication-targets Syndication Target] response.
*** If you ended up here, the request is an unknown GET request. Return '''invalid_request'''.
* Otherwise, if the request is a POST request:
** If the request has a <code>Content-type: application/json</code> header, parse the request body as JSON and assign the result to '''request_body'''. On a parsing error, return '''invalid_request'''
** Otherwise, if the request has <code>Content-type: x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, parse the request body and assign the result to '''request_body'''. On a parsing error, return '''invalid_request'''
** Otherwise, if the request has <code>Content-type: multipart/form-data</code>, parse the request body. Assign form parts to '''request_body''' and file parts to '''request_files'''
** Otherwise, the request is in an unsupported format. Return '''invalid_request'''.
** If '''request_body''' contains an '''action''' key:
*** If <code>'''request_body.action''' == "delete"</code>:
**** If your endpoint doesn’t support deleting, return '''invalid_response'''.
**** Check '''request_body''' for a <code>url</code> key. If it doesn’t have one, or '''request_body.url''' doesn’t identify a piece of content which could be deleted, return '''invalid_request'''.
**** Check to see if '''access_token''' has the required scope to delete the content identified by '''request_body.url'''. If it doesn’t, return '''insufficient_scope'''.
**** Delete the content identified by '''request_body.url'''. Return an empty HTTP 204 response.
*** Otherwise, if <code>'''request_body.action''' == "undelete"</code>:
**** If your endpoint doesn’t support undeleting, return '''invalid_response'''.
**** Check '''request_body''' for a <code>url</code> key. If it doesn’t have one, or '''request_body.url''' doesn’t identify a piece of content which could be undeleted, return '''invalid_request'''.
**** Check to see if '''access_token''' has the required scope to undelete the content identified by '''request_body.url'''. If it doesn’t, return '''insufficient_scope'''.
**** Undelete the content identified by '''request_body.url'''.
***** If the delete was successful and didn’t cause the content’s URL to change, return an empty HTTP 204 response.
***** Otherwise, if the delete was successful and did cause the content’s URL to change, return a HTTP 201 response with a <code>Location:</code> header pointing to the content’s new URL.
*** Otherwise, if <code>'''request_body.action''' == "update"</code>:
**** If your endpoint doesn’t support updating, return '''invalid_response'''.
**** Check '''request_body''' for a <code>url</code> key. If it doesn’t have one, or '''request_body.url''' doesn’t identify a piece of content which could be updated, return '''invalid_request'''.
**** Check to see if '''access_token''' has the required scope to update the content identified by '''request_body.url'''. If it doesn’t, return '''insufficient_scope'''.
**** Handle the [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#update Update] request according to the spec.
***** If the update was successful and didn’t cause the content’s URL to change, return an empty HTTP 204 response.
***** Otherwise, if the update was successful and did cause the content’s URL to change, return a HTTP 201 response with a <code>Location:</code> header pointing to the content’s new URL.
*** If you got here, an unknown '''action''' was provided. Return '''invalid_response'''
** Otherwise (POST request without <code>action</code> key in parsed body), assume that the request is a '''create''' request.
** Check whether '''access_token''' has the required scope to create new content. If not, return '''insufficient_scope'''.
** If the request had a content-type other than <code>application/json</code>, normalize the form-encoded parameters into a canonical mf2 structure as follows:
*** Let '''normalized_body''' be <code>{'type': ['h-entry'], 'properties': {}}</code>
*** For each '''key''', '''value''' pair in '''request_body''':
**** If <code>'''key''' == "h"</code>, set '''normalized_body.type''' to <code>['''value''']</code>
**** Otherwise, if '''key''' ends with <code>"[]"</code>, assign '''normalized_body.properties[key]''' to a list of all values associated with '''key'''
**** Otherwise, assign '''value''' to '''normalized_body.properties[key]'''
*** Let '''request_body''' = '''normalized_body'''
** Using '''request_body''' and '''request_files''', handle a [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#create Create] request according to the spec.
*** If the request was successful, return a HTTP 201 response with a <code>Location:</code> header containing the URL of the created content, and optionally <code>Link rel=syndication</code> and/or <code>rel=shortlink</code> headers.
* If you ended up here, the request could not be handled. Return '''invalid_request'''
