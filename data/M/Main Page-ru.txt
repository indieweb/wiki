<div><h3 style="margin:0;padding:0;font-size:1em">Your content is yours</h3> When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and [[site-deaths|lost all of their users’ data]]. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.</div>

In addition, you share simple readable links such as ''example.com/ideas''. These links are [[permalinks|permanent]] and will always work.</div>

'''The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites''', connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data. [[IndieWeb|Read more →]]

=== Beyond Blogging and Decentralization ===
The IndieWeb effort is [[different]] from previous efforts/communities:
* '''[[Principles]]''' over project-centrism. Others assume a [[monoculture]] of one project for all. We are developing a [[principles#Plurality|plurality of projects]]. The IndieWeb community has a [[code-of-conduct]]. 
* '''[[Selfdogfood]]''' instead of email. Show before tell. Prioritize by scratching your own itches, [[creator|creating]], iterating on your own site.
* '''[[Design]]''' first, protocols & formats second. Focus on good UX & selfdogfood prototypes to create minimum necessary [[formats]] &amp; [[protocols]].
Perhaps most importantly, we are people-focused instead of project-focused, and have regular meetups where everyone is welcome.
