{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Mark Safe</dfn>''' is a button that may be present next to a person listed in a [[safety check]] that may have been in the area of a disaster, but has not yet marked themselves as safe. The button may or may not be enabled, depending if the person has given you permission (presumably in advance) to mark them as safe.

Since this button likely generates a post to or about the person being marked safe, and thus could occur cross-site, it seems like a [[webaction]].
