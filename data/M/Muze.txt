Muze is an iPhone app where you can create WYSIWYG webpages directly on your phone. It requires no coding, but instead uses a freeform canvas model for users to directly manipulate text, images, gifs, drawings and more. These webpages can be accessed within the app, or available via a URL.

Muze is a startup based in Brooklyn, NY.
