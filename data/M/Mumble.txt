'''<dfn>[https://www.mumble.info/ Mumble]</dfn>''' is open-source voice chat software, with clients available for both desktop and mobile, as well as web browsers. It has been sucessfully used for [[vHWC]] EU several times.

== Servers ==
=== voice.sknebel.net ===
{{sknebel}} runs a Mumble server at mumble://voice.sknebel.net:64738. Pick a representative username, the server password is ''indie''. 
Ideally, install a [https://mumble.info Mumble client] client before the event and go through the audio setup guide. Push2Talk mode (where you press a key to activate your microphone) is the most reliable, getting voice activation configured perfectly takes some time.

If you can not install a local client, a web client (running [https://github.com/Johni0702/mumble-web mumble-web]) is also available: [https://voice.sknebel.net/?address=voice.sknebel.net&port=443/mumble&password=indie Link]. (If it doesn't work immediately, try reloading, it is a bit fiddly)


This server can be used freely for all IndieWeb community activities, but for now comes with no guarantees of availability. Please contact {{sknebel}} in [[discuss|IRC]] if there are any issues or you want to make sure it is available for an event.


==== TODO ====
* investigate low-bandwidth bridge for users on mobile/slow networks.

=== external ===
* https://guildbit.com/ offers free short-term servers

== Experiences ==
* used for vHWC EU 2017-10-18 and following ones, worked well
* the web client has some audio quality issues 
* we recommend Push2talk as the sending setting if you haven't gotten voice activation perfect
* When not using headphones there have been issues with echo cancellation not being good enough and voice from the speaker triggering the voice activiation again, causing bad echo/feedback
** This makes Mumble problematic for talking to a group of users sharing one device (e.g. HWC Berlin 2017-11-17 switched to skype for better echo cancellation
* echo cancellation seems to be missing on Mac OS https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/1775
