'''<dfn>[http://myspace.com MySpace]</dfn>''' was a popular social networking site in the 2000s that accidentally allowed HTML and CSS in profile fields, unintentionally introducing millions to the ability to customize their profiles with old independent-web-like graphics, animations, and music, and unfortunately in 2019 lost all songs, photos, and videos that were uploaded to the site before 2015.

MySpace relaunched in 2013 as a music listening service with social aspects.
