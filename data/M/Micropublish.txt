== History ==
* 2016-12-31 - Micropublish was rewritten to be compatible with recent changes to the [http://micropub.net/draft/ Micropub specification], including JSON requests for updating posts. It introduces many breaking changes from earlier versions of the spec, e.g. mp-syndicate-to instead of syndicate-to, and bookmark-of instead of bookmark.
* 2015-02-13 - The first, create-only version of Micropublish was released. It used an older, deprecated Micropub syntax.
