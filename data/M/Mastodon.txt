'''<dfn>[https://joinmastodon.org/ Mastodon]</dfn>''' (formerly '''tootsuite''') is an open source social network project that supports some IndieWeb [[building blocks]] like [[rel-me]] (and [[microformats2]] in v3.x prior to 4.0), with numerous interoperable [https://instances.mastodon.xyz/ instances], including [[indieweb.social]] for IndieWeb fans. 

IndieWeb sites interact with Mastodon instances directly & via [[Bridgy Fed]]. Mastodon is largest deployment of [[ActivityPub]] support and also has some compatibility with [[GNU social]]. As self-described in a [https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1443418665471381509 2021-09-29 tweet]:
<blockquote>"Mastodon, your cryptocurrency-free decentralized social network. No blockchains, no NFTs, no attempting to turn every social interaction into a microtransaction"</blockquote>

__TOC__
== Features ==
(this section is a stub, please expand!)

Feature summary:
* [[profile]] - ability to create an account / profile with
** photo
** bio (with autolinked URLs)
** [[h-feed]]
* [[posts]]
** [[notes]] (default limit of 500 characters but some instances have raised this, sometimes considerably)
** [[content warning]] to hide a note behind warning text, requiring a click to view
** ...
* [[responses]]
** [[mention]]
** [[reply]]
** [[favorite]] (star)
** boost - [[repost]]
** ...
* peer-to-peer following/receiving of posts from other (including non-Mastodon) servers
** based on [[ActivityPub]] server-to-server protocol
** some HTML markup permitted into Mastodon (see [[sanitize#Mastodon]] for elements+attributes)
* [[notifications]]

Specific feature details:

=== Profile ===
(stub)

Mastodon profiles show various information:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/778068/31188527-0f1a014a-a8ea-11e7-8893-0cc97c68526e.png" alt="screenshot of a Mastodon profile on a mobile display" style="max-width:50%" />

Mastodon‚Äôs [[h-feed]] support is better than their [[Atom]] support! 
* [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-07-02/1530544240607000 following someone's mastodon microformats feed gives a much better result than their atom!] - {{aaronpk}}

E.g. screenshot when trying to follow:

[[File:mastodon-follow-url.jpg|500px]]

And display of an item from a Mastodon h-feed:

[[File:mastodon-post-in-monocle.jpg|500px]]

Unfortunately, since version 4.0, Mastodon profiles and permalinks are now [[js;dr]] and no longer provide h-feed support.


=== Notifications ===
(stub)

Mastodon has a notifications page that shows various items such as when others react to your posts:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/778068/31188595-47530aca-a8ea-11e7-9a34-498935f47cb0.png

=== [[WebSub]] ===

The [[Atom]] feeds allow push notifications via WebSub, although this along with Atom support are considered legacy from its [[OStatus]] origins.

=== Federated Reply Interfaces ===

An interface for prompting the act of posting content from their preferred ActivityPub service of choice.

[[File:Screenshot 2020-08-10 Social PV.png|500px]]

=== Link Previews ===

Mastodon displays [[link-preview|link previews]] for posts, where it parses the usual [[OGP]] and [[Twitter Card]] data. In addition it has introduced its own meta data to enable crediting a [[post]]‚Äôs author with their Fediverse identity.

* <code>fediverse:creator</code> property with a Fediverse account ID, such as <code>@Gargron@mastodon.social</code>, will be picked up and added to the link preview.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb folks using Mastodon accounts, in particular [[POSSE]]ing from their IndieWeb site to Mastodon and/or [[backfeed]]ing responses from Mastodon copies of posts back to their IndieWeb site.

If you‚Äôre directly interacting with Mastodon posts on other servers from your site, you should add your site instead to:
* If you‚Äôre using [[Bridgy Fed]] to federate your posts so people on Mastodon servers can follow you directly then add yourself to: [[Bridgy_Fed#IndieWeb_Examples|IndieWeb Examples using Bridgy Fed]]
* If your server itself is directly interacting with Mastodon and other ActivityPub supporting services with Bridgy or another intermediary service, add yourself to: [[ActivityPub#IndieWeb_Examples|IndieWeb Examples supporting ActivityPub]]


Please copy the <nowiki>=== Add yourself! ===</nowiki> section and add yourself with permalinks to different/interesting examples and dates of when you first started interacting in those ways!

=== Add yourself! ===

== IndieWeb Support ==
=== Building Blocks ===
IndieWeb Building Blocks that Mastodon supports:
* [[h-card]] on comment markup in [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/ca3b364aeaa9014f23b4222a13586f42efb17b93 this patch]
* full [[h-feed]], [[h-entry]], [[h-card]] on user profiles and post permalinks in [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/421 this patch] later fixed in [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/1063 this patch]. See also [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/122 #122]
* [[rel-me]] is now support in this [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/78ed4ab75ff77d7cba60d478aa1f45d1c104785d commit] and that [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/770596f6fb65b523329a423993e649af17030ccf commit]
* ...

==== rel-me support ====
Mastodon uses [[rel-me]] to support "verified" site links in a green box with a green checkmark next to the verified site.

https://joinmastodon.org/verification explains how the verification process works.

[https://twitter.com/bkastl/status/1042708014178811904 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnhxaS1U8AAwFrP.jpg" style="max-width:45%" alt="Cropped screenshot of Bianca Kastl‚Äôs Mastodon profile showing website field with their domain and a green checkmark indicating it‚Äôs been verified" />][https://twitter.com/jgmac1106/status/1042762082905669632 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DniilmMVAAAhbch.jpg" style="max-width:45%" alt="Cropped screenshot of Greg McVerry‚Äôs Mastodon profile showing website fields with their domain and micro.blog profile with green checkmarks next to each indicating they‚Äôve been verified />]

* Washington Post ran into an issue with verification because Mastodon had a 1MB limit on pages it requested while verifying. An update was submitted that looks at the first megabyte instead of limiting the page to 1MB. A public [https://mastodon-link-debugger.vercel.app/ debugger tool] was set up as well.

== IndieWeb Requests ==
=== To Be Proposed ===
These are ideas/suggestions for Mastodon to support more IndieWeb building blocks. Feel free to file individual issues for them in https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues and then move them (and their issue link) to the '''Requests''' section below.
* [[IndieAuth]] support (both sign-in with IndieAuth, and use of a Pleroma profile as an IndieAuth identity to sign-in elsewhere)
* [[WebSub]] support. Given Mastodon's [[h-feed]] support, WebSub support would be great for realtime notifications of updates from Mastodon profiles.
* ...

=== Requests ===
==== IndieAuth Provider ====
Requested informally or as an aside. No formal issue filed (yet).

Requested on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Lady_Ada_King/status/1062518206345097216 by  [https://ada.is @Lady_Ada_King] November 14, 2018:
<blockquote>"Indie Web Awesomeness:  You can use <a rel="me"> to verify you own the sites in your mastodon profile!<br><br>It would be really cool if you could use mastodon as an authentication provider for https://indieauth.com/"</blockquote>

Also: https://aaronparecki.com/2018/11/13/10/ <blockquote>Since Mastodon already supports OAuth 2, and all users already have a URL, adding IndieAuth to Mastodon would not be a huge leap.</blockquote>

It was also discussed in the following GitHub issue: https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/4800

==== Micropub ====
If you can help add Micropub support to Mastodon, please contribute to:
* [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/2234 Mastodon issue #2234: Micropub Support]

[[Micropub]] in Mastodon support has been requested for multiple reasons on:
* [[micro.blog]]: https://micro.blog/manton/1040840
** "@nicktmro@mastodon.social @Gargron@mastodon.social I think Micropub in Mastodon is a great idea! It's a simple API (especially for posting) with support from a lot of different tools now." [https://micro.blog/manton @manton] November 13, 2018
* an indieweb personal site: https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/13/20/reply/
** "There are a bunch of great Micropub apps for the Web, iOS and Android so I definitely think it would be helpful to add Micropub support. "


Founder @Gargron noted Micropub support is ‚ÄúA lot simpler than ActivityPub C2S‚Äù:

** "@trwnh Micropub is a lot simpler than ActivityPub C2S" [https://mastodon.social/@Gargron @Gargron] November 12, 2018

=== Rejected ===
Please consider rejections as opportunities to listen for feedback on how to improve indieweb building blocks, and always respond politely. It's a good thing when people spend their own time to analyze these requests and provide their reasons for rejection.

* 2018-04-03: [[Webmention]] sending support was surveyed ([https://www.strawpoll.me/15428538/r most were for it]), but [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/6074#comment-378452136 rejected] (2018-04-03) for a set of privacy concerns that are worth addressing or at least having answers for. E.g. "It's a privacy violation that people aren't expecting", is no more true for sending Webmentions than sending referrer headers, or allowing search engine indexing ‚Äî all of which could be gated on the same site/user preference.
* 2017-04-21: Subscribe to Atom feeds directly [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/1081]
** Update: "I do not plan on supporting Atom feeds that don't have Webfinger and Salmon (i.e. non-interactive, non-user feeds)"
* ...

If you want to re-request a rejected feature, please at a minimum:
* document the list of specific reasons for rejection of a feature
* somehow fix or address (via documentation etc.) the reasons for rejection, i.e. here on the wiki, or by updating the spec for the rejected feature.
* wait some amount of time before re-requesting. case-by-case judgment call. i.e. if you're able to quickly address all the problems noted, follow-up with a thank you for the feedback and link to where you have addressed the problems. otherwise consider waiting at least a few months, perhaps even a year before re-requesting. In either case, make it very clear what changes have occurred that make the feature request worthy of reconsideration.

== Other Standards Support ==
Other standards and building blocks that Mastodon supports or depends on
=== Webfinger ===
Mastodon depends on [[Webfinger]] for various discovery use-cases.

* 2022-12-06 [https://justingarrison.com/blog/2022-12-06-mastodon-files-instance/ Mastodon instance with 6 files], describes the minimum six necessary files, starting with /[[webfinger]]?request=acct:user@domain, that a Mastodon instance will query your site at "domain" to do [[discovery]] for user profile information.

E.g. this non-Mastodon example demonstrates some of what Mastodon depends on: 
* https://manton.org/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct%3Amanton@manton.org which redirects to: 
* https://micro.blog/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct%3Amanton@manton.org which returns JSON

Note that [[ActivityPub]] itself has zero dependency on Webfinger, and thus it should be possible to support ActivityPub federation without Webfinger.

* [[to-do]]: inspect those six minimum files for which properties are truly essential, and which can be left out (without breaking Mastodon's consuming code flow), and come up with an alternative [[FYN]] discovery method to use instead, and propose as a fallback for Webfinger, so sites don't have to bother with supporting any explicit root level /[[.well-known]] paths.

== Issues ==
=== Current ===
See Mastodon Github Issues:
* https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues

=== Resolved ===
Resolved or apparently resolved past issues.

* Official blog is no longer dependent on [[Medium]] and is built on [[Hugo]] instead. https://github.com/mastodon/blog

==== One Primary Instance ====
Resolution: Apparently resolved as there is a growing number of Mastodon instances (and the "primary" instances is now closed to new signups). See:
* https://instances.mastodon.xyz/
* https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/List-of-Mastodon-instances.md

Issue:

One danger, that projects like Mastodon face, is when they are used as a service by more than one user, any downtime will affect multiple users. For instance, on the morning of Nov 11, 2016 the [https://mastodon.social mastodon.social] instance was down briefly and [https://indieweb.org/File:2016-11-02-mastodon-down-502.png#filelinks displayed a generic server error].

In this regard, promoting "mastodon.social" the site in particular as an alternative to Twitter (e.g. see tweets encouraging "[https://twitter.com/search?q=join+mastodon.social+twitter join me on mastodon.social]") merely encourage users to go from one silo, to a perhaps more open source-based and more open standards supporting silo, yet still dependent on another central org.

As a contrast, if each user were to run their own Mastodon instance, one instance going down would not affect multiple users in this fashion. Second best would be if users who choose not to run on their own servers were instead encouraged get together with someone that does, which again, would limit the exposure of when one instance goes down. But when such users all join a single server (e.g. the mastodon.social site itself) or any platform with similar architecture, they will suffer from this [[Single Point of Failure | single point of failure]] in design.

On the other hand, multi-user instances benefit from shared community oversight, in the form of having admins and moderators who (presumably) actively block known-hostile instances and users.

'''Update''' (and one way to resolve this!) As of 2017-04-04 (or earlier?) mastodon.social is no longer accepting sign-ups and directing people to sign-up elsewhere:  https://mastodon.social/about

<blockquote>"Due to exceptionally high traffic, registrations on this instance are closed until quality of service can be assured for existing users. Choose one of the various other public instances to sign up!"</blockquote>

== POSSE  ==
* [[Bridgy]] Publish supports POSSEing to Mastodon.
* [https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot Feed2Toot] is a python command-line tool to POSSE any RSS Feed to Mastodon.
* {{chrisaldrich}} uses the [[WordPress]] plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/autopost-to-mastodon/ Mastodon Autopost] to [[POSSE]] posts from his site to Mastodon. (There is also a similar plugin called  [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mastodon-share/ Mastodon Share] that does roughly the same thing.) As of late 2019 he's getting [[backfeed]] from Mastodon posts via [[brid.gy]]. 
* {{chrisaldrich}} also uses Daniel Nix's [[Known]] plugin [https://github.com/danito/KnownMastodon Known Mastodon] to syndicate to Mastodon since April 2017.
* {{jgmac1106}} uses the WordPress plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mastodon-share/ Mastodon auto share] to [[POSSE]] posts as toots. Replies to the toots are not syndicated back to the original post given the current misgiving Mastodon developers have towards webmentions.
* {{jgmac1106}} also uses the activity stream plugin,host meta-data plugin, oStatus plugin, salmon plugin, and the webfinger plugin by {{pfefferle}} to create a fediverse instance of his own domain at jgmac1106@jgregorymcverry.com
* {{doubleloop}} also uses the [[WordPress]] plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/autopost-to-mastodon/ Mastodon Autopost] to [[POSSE]] posts from his site to Mastodon.
** Added a syndication target to allow syndicating to Mastodon when posting via Micropub (https://github.com/ngm/doublepress/blob/master/functions.php#L593).
* All [[micro.blog]] hosted blogs or integrated feeds can POSSE to Mastodon by setting up cross-posting in their "Feeds & Cross-Posting" settings: https://micro.blog/account/feeds

== Federating Directly with Mastodon ==
Some in the IndieWeb community are working on bridging the gap between the Fediverse and the IndieWeb efforts, some of these include Advanced plugins/extensions/software which shouldn't require a Mastodon account on an instance as they make your site behave like a standalone instance of Mastodon:
* {{snarfed}} has released [[Bridgy Fed]] which allows one to let their own website federate directly into Mastodon and other networks in various ways. Released in October 2017, it's still under development.
* {{pfefferle}} has a [[WordPress]] [https://wordpress.org/plugins/ostatus-for-wordpress/ OStatus plugin] which supports a variety of post kinds on Mastodon; it includes a handful of sub-plugins (Webfinger, [[Salmon]], [[Activity Streams]], etc.) to get everything working. Some of the pieces are out of date in October 2017, but are being upgraded over time.
** {{chrisaldrich}} is using {{pfefferle}}'s [https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/ ActivityPub plugin] and [https://wordpress.org/plugins/nodeinfo/ NodeInfo plugin] to make his WordPress website https://boffosocko.com to appear as an ActivityPub instance that can be followed on Mastodon at @chrisaldrich@boffosocko.com. Broad details for setting this up on [[WordPress]] can be found in the plugins or in this post: https://boffosocko.com/2022/04/25/55804148/#comment-374484
* {{aaronpk}} implemented the bare minimum of the ActivityPub spec to be able to comment on Mastodon posts and receive comments, as well as to be able to be followed by Mastodon users. To follow Mastodon users, he follows their profile pages which contain Microformats markup. To receive comments, incoming "Inbox" notifications are discarded and are forwarded on via Webmention instead, which works since Mastodon permalinks contain good Microformats for parsing the reply.
* Lewis Dale has written a post on how they used [[Eleventy]] and [[Netlify]] to use their [[personal website]] as a [[Mastodon]] account: [https://lewisdale.dev/post/you-can-be-friends-with-my-blog/ Be Friends with my Blog]
* All [[micro.blog]] hosted blogs with a ''custom'' domain can set up a Mastodon-compatible ActivityPub feed in their account settings, so that Mastodon users can follow and interact with them: https://micro.blog/account

== Criticism ==
=== Challenges picking an instance ===
* Choosing a particular instance can not only be difficult, but finding one that will have some longevity and treat its users' data respectfully can be spotty.
