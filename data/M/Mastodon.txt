'''<dfn>[https://joinmastodon.org/ Mastodon]</dfn>''' is an open source social network project that supports some IndieWeb [[building blocks]] like [[microformats2]] & [[rel-me]], and has a federation of [https://instances.mastodon.xyz/ many instances], including https://indieweb.social/ for IndieWeb fans. 

IndieWeb sites interact Mastodon instances directly & via [[Bridgy Fed]]. Mastodon is largest deployment of [[ActivityPub]] support and also has some compatibility with [[GNU social]]. As self-described in a [https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1443418665471381509 2021-09-29 tweet]:
<blockquote>"Mastodon, your cryptocurrency-free decentralized social network. No blockchains, no NFTs, no attempting to turn every social interaction into a microtransaction"</blockquote>

== IndieWeb Support ==
=== Building Blocks ===
IndieWeb Building Blocks that Mastodon supports:
* [[h-card]] on comment markup in [https://github.com/Gargron/mastodon/commit/ca3b364aeaa9014f23b4222a13586f42efb17b93 this patch]

* ...

==== rel-me support ====
Mastodon uses [[rel-me]] to support "verified" site links in a green box with a green checkmark next to the verified site.

https://joinmastodon.org/verification explains how the verification process works.

[https://twitter.com/bkastl/status/1042708014178811904 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnhxaS1U8AAwFrP.jpg" style="max-width:45%" alt="Cropped screenshot of Bianca Kastl’s Mastodon profile showing website field with their domain and a green checkmark indicating it’s been verified" />][https://twitter.com/jgmac1106/status/1042762082905669632 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DniilmMVAAAhbch.jpg" style="max-width:45%" alt="Cropped screenshot of Greg McVerry’s Mastodon profile showing website fields with their domain and micro.blog profile with green checkmarks next to each indicating they’ve been verified />]

* Washington Post ran into an issue with verification because Mastodon had a 1MB limit on pages it requested while verifying. An update was submitted that looks at the first megabyte instead of limiting the page to 1MB. A public [https://mastodon-link-debugger.vercel.app/ debugger tool] was set up as well.

== IndieWeb Requests ==
=== To Be Proposed ===
These are ideas/suggestions for Mastodon to support more IndieWeb building blocks. Feel free to file individual issues for them in https://github.com/Gargron/mastodon/issues and then move them (and their issue link) to the '''Requests''' section below.
* [[IndieAuth]] support (both sign-in with IndiAuth, and use of a Pleroma profile as an IndieAuth identity to sign-in elsewhere)
* [[WebSub]] support. Given Mastodon's [[h-feed]] support, WebSub support would be great for realtime notifications of updates from Mastodon profiles.
* ...

=== Requests ===
==== IndieAuth Provider ====
Requested informally or as an aside. No formal issue filed (yet).

Requested on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Lady_Ada_King/status/1062518206345097216 by  [https://ada.is @Lady_Ada_King] November 14, 2018:
<blockquote>"Indie Web Awesomeness:  You can use <a rel="me"> to verify you own the sites in your mastodon profile!<br><br>It would be really cool if you could use mastodon as an authentication provider for https://indieauth.com/"</blockquote>

Also: https://aaronparecki.com/2018/11/13/10/ <blockquote>Since Mastodon already supports OAuth 2, and all users already have a URL, adding IndieAuth to Mastodon would not be a huge leap.</blockquote>

It was also discussed in the following GitHub issue: https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/4800

==== Micropub ====
If you can help add Micropub support to Mastodon, please contribute to:
* [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/2234 Mastodon issue #2234: Micropub Support]

[[Micropub]] in Mastodon support has been requested for multiple reasons on:
* [[micro.blog]]: https://micro.blog/manton/1040840
** "@nicktmro@mastodon.social @Gargron@mastodon.social I think Micropub in Mastodon is a great idea! It's a simple API (especially for posting) with support from a lot of different tools now." [https://micro.blog/manton @manton] November 13, 2018
* an indieweb personal site: https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/13/20/reply/
** "There are a bunch of great Micropub apps for the Web, iOS and Android so I definitely think it would be helpful to add Micropub support. "


Founder @Gargron noted Micropub support is “A lot simpler than ActivityPub C2S”:

=== Rejected ===
Please consider rejections as opportunities to listen for feedback on how to improve indieweb building blocks, and always respond politely. It's a good thing when people spend their own time to analyze these requests and provide their reasons for rejection.

* 2018-04-03: [[Webmention]] sending support was surveyed ([https://www.strawpoll.me/15428538/r most were for it]), but [https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/6074#comment-378452136 rejected] (2018-04-03) for a set of privacy concerns that are worth addressing or at least having answers for. E.g. "It's a privacy violation that people aren't expecting", is no more true for sending Webmentions than sending referrer headers, or allowing search engine indexing — all of which could be gated on the same site/user preference.
* 2017-04-21: Subscribe to Atom feeds directly [https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/1081]
** Update: "I do not plan on supporting Atom feeds that don't have Webfinger and Salmon (i.e. non-interactive, non-user feeds)"
* ...

If you want to re-request a rejected feature, please at a minimum:
* document the list of specific reasons for rejection of a feature
* somehow fix or address (via documentation etc.) the reasons for rejection, i.e. here on the wiki, or by updating the spec for the rejected feature.
* wait some amount of time before re-requesting. case-by-case judgment call. i.e. if you're able to quickly address all the problems noted, follow-up with a thank you for the feedback and link to where you have addressed the problems. otherwise consider waiting at least a few months, perhaps even a year before re-requesting. In either case, make it very clear what changes have occurred that make the feature request worthy of reconsideration.


== Issues ==
=== Current ===
See Mastodon Github Issues:
* https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues

=== Resolved ===
Resolved or apparently resolved past issues.

* Official blog is no longer dependent on [[Medium]] and is built on [[Hugo]] instead. https://github.com/mastodon/blog

==== One Primary Instance ====
Resolution: Apparently resolved as there is a growing number of Mastodon instances (and the "primary" instances is now closed to new signups). See:
* https://instances.mastodon.xyz/
* https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/List-of-Mastodon-instances.md

Issue:

One danger, that projects like Mastodon face, is when they are used as a service by more than one user, any downtime will affect multiple users. For instance, on the morning of Nov 11, 2016 the [https://mastodon.social mastodon.social] instance was down briefly and [https://indieweb.org/File:2016-11-02-mastodon-down-502.png#filelinks displayed a generic server error].

In this regard, promoting "mastodon.social" the site in particular as an alternative to Twitter (e.g. see tweets encouraging "[https://twitter.com/search?q=join+mastodon.social+twitter join me on mastodon.social]") merely encourage users to go from one silo, to a perhaps more open source-based and more open standards supporting silo, yet still dependent on another central org.

As a contrast, if each user were to run their own Mastodon instance, one instance going down would not affect multiple users in this fashion. Second best would be if users who choose not to run on their own servers were instead encouraged get together with someone that does, which again, would limit the exposure of when one instance goes down. But when such users all join a single server (e.g. the mastodon.social site itself) or any platform with similar architecture, they will suffer from this [[Single Point of Failure | single point of failure]] in design.

On the other hand, multi-user instances benefit from shared community oversight, in the form of having admins and moderators who (presumably) actively block known-hostile instances and users.

'''Update''' (and one way to resolve this!) As of 2017-04-04 (or earlier?) mastodon.social is no longer accepting sign-ups and directing people to sign-up elsewhere:  https://mastodon.social/about

<blockquote>"Due to exceptionally high traffic, registrations on this instance are closed until quality of service can be assured for existing users. Choose one of the various other public instances to sign up!"</blockquote>

== POSSE  ==
* [[Bridgy]] Publish supports POSSEing to Mastodon.
* [https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot Feed2Toot] is a python command-line tool to POSSE any RSS Feed to Mastodon.
* {{chrisaldrich}} uses the [[WordPress]] plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/autopost-to-mastodon/ Mastodon Autopost] to [[POSSE]] posts from his site to Mastodon. (There is also a similar plugin called  [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mastodon-share/ Mastodon Share] that does roughly the same thing.) As of late 2019 he's getting [[backfeed]] from Mastodon posts via [[brid.gy]]. 
* {{chrisaldrich}} also uses Daniel Nix's [[Known]] plugin [https://github.com/danito/KnownMastodon Known Mastodon] to syndicate to Mastodon since April 2017.
* {{jgmac1106}} uses the WordPress plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mastodon-share/ Mastodon auto share] to [[POSSE]] posts as toots. Replies to the toots are not syndicated back to the original post given the current misgiving Mastodon developers have towards webmentions.
* {{jgmac1106}} also uses the activity stream plugin,host meta-data plugin, oStatus plugin, salmon plugin, and the webfinger plugin by {{pfefferle}} to create a fediverse instance of his own domain at jgmac1106@jgregorymcverry.com
* {{doubleloop}} also uses the [[WordPress]] plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/autopost-to-mastodon/ Mastodon Autopost] to [[POSSE]] posts from his site to Mastodon.
** Added a syndication target to allow syndicating to Mastodon when posting via Micropub (https://github.com/ngm/doublepress/blob/master/functions.php#L593).
* All [[micro.blog]] hosted blogs or integrated feeds can POSSE to Mastodon by setting up cross-posting in their "Feeds & Cross-Posting" settings: https://micro.blog/account/feeds
* {{tonz}} uses Mastodon Autopost [https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/08/added-mastodon-autopost-plugin-to-wordpress-blog/ since August 2019].
* {{calumryan}} uses the [[POSSE]] approach to publish short-form posts to Mastodon. They syndicate posts from their [[Kirby]] CMS interface with a custom-built hook function and checkbox field utilizing the [https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-php mention-client-php] to send [[Webmentions]] to [[brid.gy]] in the same method as used for publishing to Twitter.
* {{campegg}} uses the [[POSSE]] approach to selectively publish, edit (delete-and-redraft/repost), and delete notes on Mastodon from [[Django]] using [https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py Mastodon.py] since July 2022.

== Federating Directly with Mastodon ==
Some in the IndieWeb community are working on bridging the gap between the Fediverse and the IndieWeb efforts, some of these include Advanced plugins/extensions/software which shouldn't require a Mastodon account on an instance as they make your site behave like a standalone instance of Mastodon:
* {{snarfed}} has released [[Bridgy Fed]] which allows one to let their own website federate directly into Mastodon and other networks in various ways. Released in October 2017, it's still under development.
* {{pfefferle}} has a [[WordPress]] [https://wordpress.org/plugins/ostatus-for-wordpress/ OStatus plugin] which supports a variety of post kinds on Mastodon; it includes a handful of sub-plugins (Webfinger, [[Salmon]], [[Activity Streams]], etc.) to get everything working. Some of the pieces are out of date in October 2017, but are being upgraded over time.
** {{chrisaldrich}} is using {{pfefferle}}'s [https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/ ActivityPub plugin] and [https://wordpress.org/plugins/nodeinfo/ NodeInfo plugin] to make his WordPress website https://boffosocko.com to appear as an ActivityPub instance that can be followed on Mastodon at @chrisaldrich@boffosocko.com. Broad details for setting this up on [[WordPress]] can be found in the plugins or in this post: https://boffosocko.com/2022/04/25/55804148/#comment-374484
* {{aaronpk}} implemented the bare minimum of the ActivityPub spec to be able to comment on Mastodon posts and receive comments, as well as to be able to be followed by Mastodon users. To follow Mastodon users, he follows their profile pages which contain Microformats markup. To receive comments, incoming "Inbox" notifications are discarded and are forwarded on via Webmention instead, which works since Mastodon permalinks contain good Microformats for parsing the reply.
* Lewis Dale has written a post on how they used [[Eleventy]] and [[Netlify]] to use their [[personal website]] as a [[Mastodon]] account: [https://lewisdale.dev/post/you-can-be-friends-with-my-blog/ Be Friends with my Blog]
* All [[micro.blog]] hosted blogs with a ''custom'' domain can set up a Mastodon-compatible ActivityPub feed in their account settings, so that Mastodon users can follow and interact with them: https://micro.blog/account
