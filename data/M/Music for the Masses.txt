'''<dfn>Music for the Masses</dfn>''' is a Depeche Mode album (sometimes informally referred to as <dfn>for the masses</dfn>) named sarcastically in response to being told to make something “more commercial” — if you’re obsessing about building your IndieWeb project “for the masses”, please don’t, instead, start with [[principle]] 3.
