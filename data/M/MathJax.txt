'''<dfn>[https://www.mathjax.org/ MathJax]</dfn>''' is a [[JavaScript]] display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers. It uses [[CSS]] with web fonts or [[SVG]], instead of bitmap images or Flash, so equations scale with surrounding text at all zoom levels.

One can use MathML, TeX, and ASCIImath as input and produce HTML+CSS, SVG, or MathML as output.
It also works with screenreaders & provides expression zoom and interactive exploration. One can also copy equations into Office, LaTeX, wikis, and other software.
