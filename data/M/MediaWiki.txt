'''<dfn>[http://mediawiki.org/ MediaWiki]</dfn>''' is open source server [[wiki-project]] written in [[PHP]] that is used by [[Wikipedia]] and IndieWeb.org.

MediaWiki uses [[MySQL]] for primary storage.

== Why ==
The IndieWebCamp community uses MediaWiki as a collaborative document editing tool, to capture "what is the current state of something", to make it easier to reference answers, definitions, how tos, etc.

MediaWiki just happens to have better persistence / search discovery than alternatives that are equivalently community accessible (E.g. [[Etherpad]], [[Google]] Docs, both of which have the [[js;dr]] problem and neither of which are search engine indexed.)

== Building Block Proposals ==
There are a number of proposals to add indieweb building blocks support to MediaWiki that can quicly and easily satisfy some great use-cases, as well as potentially improving performance (e.g. encouraging switching from polling to notification)
