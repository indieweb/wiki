== Client implementation requests ==
Requests for other client-software to implement Micropub

=== Macaw ===
[https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/macaw?src=featured Macaw] is an "open source micro-blogging client, with support for ADN (app.net) and Twitter (twitter.com)."

Request for Micropub support:
* https://github.com/minego/macaw-enyo/issues/27

=== Ulysses ===
[[Ulysses]] is a markdown writing app that supports publishing writing to Wordpress servers and Medium.

Request for Micropub support:
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} submitted a short request on November 8, 2017 using their feedback system outlining the fact that it is an open w3c standard with links to the w3c recommendation page, the IndieWeb micropub page and. the test suite [https://micropub.rocks micropub.rocks]. He also listed the servers they would be able to post to (Known, Wordpress, Drupal) with a link to the Micropub Servers page and specially called out [https://micro.blog micro.blog] support.
* The Ulysses Twitter account [https://twitter.com/ulyssesapp/status/1148578698288934912 acknowledged a request for Micropub support]
** "Thank you for bringing that up! I've +1'd the feature request for a Micropub integration in your name, so please consider your vote counted. I can't make any promises when or whether we will implement this feature, but your feedback is highly appreciated." [http://ulyssesapp.com @ulyssesapp] July 9, 2019

=== Buffer ===
[[Buffer]] is a social media support app that allows for the writing and queuing of social media posts across platforms.

Request for Micropub support:
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} submitted a short request [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/08/20/30/reply/ on August 21, 2018 using their feedback system] outlining the fact that it is an open w3c standard with links to the w3c spec pages for both IndieAuth and Micropub. He put this request in under the request for Micro.blog support (that other people are also using their form to request). But the added benefit, of course, is if they build in IndieAuth/Micropub support for Micro.blog, it could also be used as a generic Micropub queue client.

=== Hypothes.is ===
