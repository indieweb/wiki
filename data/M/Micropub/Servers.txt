=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] supports Micropub via the [[Micropub for WordPress]] plugin, originally created by {{snarfed}}

As of 2016-12-12 it supports posting with FormEncoded and JSON, and has a branch for update (replace and add) that needs some cleaning and 'delete' support before it can be merged.
