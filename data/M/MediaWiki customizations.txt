<div class="p-summary">'''<dfn>MediaWiki customizations</dfn>''' are changes to the default install of MediaWiki that the IndieWeb community has made for various reasons to better serve how the community uses the wiki.</div>

== extensions ==
=== IndieWeb extensions ===
https://github.com/indieweb/mediawiki-extensions

* AllowAnchorTags - allows inserting <code><a></code> anchor tags into wikitext
* notitle - adds <code><nowiki>__NOTITLE__</nowiki></code> tag to stop MediaWiki from adding its own page title
* raw - lets you embed raw HTML into wiki pages using <nowiki>raw</nowiki>
* RelWebmention - add webmention endpoint to wiki pages
* LassoAuth - enables [[web sign-in]]/[[IndieAuth]] via [[vouch-proxy]]
** See [[MediaWiki#Setting_up_MediaWiki_with_IndieAuth|Setting up MediaWiki with IndieAuth]] for details
* Calendar - adds <nowiki><calendar></nowiki> tag for creation of a single month calendar

=== dfn ===
https://github.com/aaronpk/mediawiki-mf2-dfn

Adds a <code>p-summary</code> tag around the first sentence of a page that contains a <code><nowiki><dfn></nowiki></code> tag

To actually enable the page to be an h-entry, you'll need to edit the theme to add the h-entry class.

In Vector 2022 and Vector 2010, the new version that uses mustache templates, do the following:

* Edit <code>skin.mustache</code> and <code>skin-legacy.mustache</code>
* Find the <code>class="mw-body"</code> line and add <code>h-entry</code> class
* Add <code><raw><a href="" class="u-url"></a></raw></code> below that line
* Wrap <code>{{{html-title-heading}}}</code> as: <code><raw><span class="p-name">{{{html-title-heading}}}</span></raw></code>

=== CategoryTree ===
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CategoryTree

=== mf2 parser ===
The wiki requires a Microformats parser to be able to do a few things. Copy the [https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2 php-mf2] repository to the extensions folder.

=== OpenGraphMeta ===
* https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:OpenGraphMeta

== skin ==
We use the default Vector skin for the wiki, with some minor customization to add Microformats markup to pages.

In <code>skins/Vector/VectorTemplate.php</code>, make the changes described on https://aaronparecki.com/2018/01/14/3/

== front page ==
MediaWiki refuses to serve the front page from <code>/</code> and insists on redirecting it to <code>/Main_Page</code> instead. It's possible to rename that page to something like <code>/Home</code>, but even that isn't great. We want the front page to be served at just <code>https://indieweb.org/</code>. To do that, there is a separate <code>index.php</code> file at the root of the server, which essentially proxies the MediaWiki page.

<pre><?php
$opts = array('title' => 'Main_Page');
if(array_key_exists('useskin',$_GET))
  $opts['useskin'] = $_GET['useskin'];
$ch = curl_init('https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?'.http_build_query($opts));
// Pass the HTTP_COOKIE header through for auth
if(array_key_exists('HTTP_COOKIE', $_SERVER)) {
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
		'Cookie: ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_COOKIE']
	));
}

header('Link: <https://webmention.io/indiewebcamp/webmention>; rel="webmention"');

// No-cache if the user is logged in
if(isset($_SERVER['REMOTE_USER'])) {
  header('Cache-Control: no-cache');
}

curl_exec($ch);</pre>


== FAQ ==
=== Why are talk pages disabled ===
[http://xkcd.com/1665 <img style="max-width:25%;float:right" alt="XKCD Cartoon 1665 about Wikipedia talk pages" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNbvkWdUYAAj9IT.jpg" />]
Talk pages are disabled as most of the talk happens in [[discuss]]ion chat channels. The best pieces or synopses are usually then summarized and added the wiki subsequently.

Also, having multiple places for discussion often fragments the discussion between what’s natural and what feels official.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Issues ===
==== Is there a GitHub repo for issues ====
Do we have a GitHub repo for collecting issues with the wiki? Should we?
==== Wiki is unusable on mobile ====
Our default theme (Vector) is unusable on mobile
* '''Vector 2022''' alternative/update appears to have good mobile presentation
* Workaround: (if you are logged in)
** Go to '''[[Special:Preferences]]'''
** Click the '''Appearance''' tab ([[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering]])
** Choose '''(•) Vector 2022'''
** Click the '''Save''' button
** Now when you are logged into the IndieWeb wiki on your mobile device, any IndieWeb wiki pages will be much more usable.
* Proposal: switch not-logged-in and default skin to Vector 2022, and fix regressions (perhaps fixing regressions first)
** withdrawn by {{t}}, too many regressions to just switch and try to fix while live (which may take months given past experience).
* Vector 2022 regressions, compared to Vector 2010 (should fix before changing it to be the default for logged in users, and the skin for not-logged-in readers)
** Previous notes<blockquote><p>{{gRegor}}: it looks like we might have `$wgVectorDefaultSkinVersion = '1';` set in LocalSettings. I see that value in some JSON when I view source. However I don't think we can just flip the switch on vector-2022 due to the homepage.  </p><p>For MW 1.36 and 1.37 that was supposed to be set to 2. As of 1.38, which we're on now, it's just `$wgDefaultSkin = 'vector-2022';` https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector/2022#Making_Vector_2022_the_default_skin  </p><p>Preview homepage with Vector 2022: https://indieweb.org/?useskin=vector-2022</p><cite>https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2022-11-16#t1668577560889100</cite></blockquote>
*** I can't find the chat logs for this, but I noticed the version numbering for Vector 2022 is weird. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Version Wikipedia's Special:Version] shows a hash and date after the version number, currently "1.0.0 (22b26ef) 20:21, November 6, 2023". Compare our [[Special:Version]] page only shows "1.0.0", so it appears they're not updating the main version number with different releases, only commit hashes? I would recommend we update the installed Vector 2022 skin and make sure the PHP variables quoted above are correct. Fingers crossed that might fix the main issues -- then we can update the custom homepage layout as needed to work with latest Vector 2022. <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/6268/profile-2021-square.300x0.jpg}}  [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 11:16, 9 November 2023 (PST)
*** I noticed this weird version numbering too; the later releases of Vector are quite a bit more refined, and used by default for the English language Wikipedia. Might be worth testing with the revised Vector skin to see what issues remain. As to the homepage, is it possible to make it less customised in terms of layout and navigation? Focus on the content, rather than the design? What’s the best way to prevent the homepage from blocking the release of a more usable site overall? {{paulrobertlloyd}} 00:25, 21 November 2023 (GMT)
** Top left logo is missing
*** Possible fix: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Topic:Wrztkw86y4j2x2w2
** Search box no longer provides drop-down of suggested pages while you type
*** This is due to the rest-API at /wiki/rest.php not being exposed (cf https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:REST_API), likely a configuration issue with our webserver

==== Overlapping home page header text on mobile ====
Wiki [[Main_Page|homepage]] has overlapping text in the header on mobile (similarly on both current Vector 2010 skin, and Vector 2022 skin; a fix should fix it in both)

==== Improve legibility ====

…and more closely align design with IndieWeb Events website

{{ paulrobertlloyd }} is using the vector 2022 theme with the following customisations: https://indieweb.org/User:Paulrobertlloyd.com/vector-2022.css. This stylesheet changes:

* the default font stack to use the user’s system font family. This broadly aligns with https://events.indieweb.org, which users a longer list of fonts that approximates using <code>system-ui</code>.
* the heading font family and weight to again match IndieWeb Events but also moves the appearance of the site away from Wikipedia.
* the default body font size from 14px to 16px which makes content appear more legible, readable and approachable.

Suggestions:

* incorporate these changes into the Vector 2022 theme for all users, once the default theme has been switched.
* upgrade the latest iteration of Vector 2022 which has improved visual design around site and content navigation.

==== Outdated sponsor logos ====

The following sponsors logos in the footer are not up-to-date:

* <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Okta_logo_%282023%29.svg" alt="Okta logo" height="48" style="padding:8px">

* <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Sipgate.svg" alt="Sipgate logo" height="48" style="padding:8px">

* <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg" alt="Google logo" height="48" style="padding:8px">

* <img src="https://asset.brandfetch.io/idOqnvXFFv/idW6EQV0hU.svg" alt="Clearleft logo" height="48" style="padding:8px">

Additionally, the link to idno.co no longer works. Should it (and the logo) be updated to https://withknown.com?
