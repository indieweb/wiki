'''<dfn>[https://www.manyver.se/ Manyverse]</dfn>''' is a decentralized ("off-grid") messaging and sharing mobile app built on top of [[Secure Scuttlebutt]] (SSB).  [https://gitlab.com/staltz/manyverse Code on GitLab].

> Manyverse is a social network mobile app with features you would expect: posts, threads, likes, profiles, etc. But it's not running in the cloud owned by a company, instead, your friends' posts and all your social data live entirely in your phone. This way, even when you're offline, you can scroll, read anything, and even write posts and like content! When your phone is back online, it syncs the latest updates directly with your friends' phones, through a shared local Wi-Fi or on the internet.

> We're building this free and open source project as a community effort because we believe in non-commercial, neutral, and fair mobile communication for everyone.
