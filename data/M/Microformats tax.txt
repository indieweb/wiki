'''<dfn>Microformats tax</dfn>''' is the additional effort required to maintain the Microformats markup on a web page when you want to make unrelated changes to the web page.

The flip side is feeling limited in what you can change because you don't want to break the Microformats markup. [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-01-17/1516214040920500]
