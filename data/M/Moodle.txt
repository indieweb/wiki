'''<dfn>[https://moodle.org/ Moodle]</dfn>''' is an open source [[content management system]] (CMS) (most often used as a learning management system (LMS)) primarily designed to help [[Indieweb for Education|educators]] host online course materials. Various modules can be used to create an online [[identity]], a [[blog]], a [[wiki]], and even [[forum|fora]].

While most often used by colleges, universities, and other education-based institutions, the software can be run and used by a single user to create a personal website.


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} runs Moodle on a subdomain of his own website, though he doesn't use it as a [[multi-site indieweb|primary site]] for his online identity. He's used it (and other hosted versions) to maintain drafts of [[articles]] or semi-public posts as well as to draft or keep archived copies of prior course materials on a site he owns. He's also used the activity modules to host a course/class-specific [[wiki]] in the past, but generally prefers to use [[MediaWiki]] for this functionality.
