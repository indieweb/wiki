'''<dfn>[http://micro.blog Micro.blog]</dfn>''' is an indie microblogging service started by [http://www.manton.org/ Manton Reece], which supports [[microformats|microformats2]], [[Webmention]], and [[Micropub]].

== Overview ==
The [[Jekyll]]-based service supports posting of [[notes]] (up to 280 characters). [[photos|Photos]] can be posted to the service (using Micropub) or pulled in via [[RSS]].

The project was launched in beta on 2017-04-23 following a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing Kickstarter campaign] beginning in January 2017 in which 3,080 backers pledged $86,696. The project was originally called [http://www.manton.org/2016/07/pre-announcing-snippets-today.html Snippets.today].

One can bring their own [[projects|project]] and [[personal-domain]] to the service and post to it via RSS or purchase a hosted microblog for $5/month with a free 10-day trial.

__TOC__

== Why ==
Micro.blog is a great way to get started on the IndieWeb and reach a thoughtful community in several ways:

# '''Want to try out the IndieWeb without a domain?''' If you don't have a domain name but want to try out some of the features of the IndieWeb, you can create a Micro.blog account, follow folks there, and reply to posts both on Micro.blog and elsewhere on the IndieWeb. If you decide to get a domain name, Micro.blog will help you transition to using it with their site (see 2), or even export your posts to a new site of your own which you can connect to your Micro.blog account (see 3).
# '''Have a domain name but no site yet?''' For those without a primary website, they can register a domain and connect it to Micro.blog as a hosting service for a minimal per month fee. Micro.blog will then allow them to post [[note|notes]], [[article|articles]], [[photo|photos]], and other types of posts easily. If they choose, there's excellent import/export to allow them to relatively easily swap platforms.
# '''Have a site already?''' For those who already have a primary website on another service or platform, they can easily syndicate their content (via [[RSS]] or [[JSON]]) into the Micro.blog service and use the service's reader to interact with other users while still owning their own content and receiving replies/comments via webmention. If their site also supports micropub, they can utilize the service to compose their content and micropub it to their own site after which it will appear on Micro.blog via feed.

== How to ==
(stub)
=== How to POSSE ===
How to crosspost or syndicate from your blog to Micro.blog:
* add your [[feed file]] URL to your Micro.blog profile

How to set up Micro.blog to check your feed file automatically after creating a POSSE'd post in WordPress:
* add https://micro.blog/ping on a separate line in the Update Services section of the Writing Settings page

== Indieweb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} uses micro.blog/aaronpk to automatically syndicate his main aaronparecki.com website feed
* {{t}} uses micro.blog/t to automatically syndicate his main tantek.com website feed file (updates.atom)
* {{chrisaldrich}} - experimenting with a [https://c.micro.blog hosted site] (during beta roll-out at least to see how well it supports IndieWeb)
** I've mapped over my [[personal-domain]] using CNAME as described [http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/ here].
** It includes the RSS feed of my [[Known]] site which feeds those status updates into the system. People who reply on them within Micro.blog send [[webmention|webmentions]] back to the original post in a straightforward manner. WordPress RSS feeds work similarly.
* {{jeremycherfas}} uses micro.blog/jeremycherfas to syndicate portions of https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/ feed and posts from https://jeremycherfas.net 
* {{colinwalker}} uses micro.blog/colinwalker to syndicate the main feed from the self-hosted WordPress blog https://colinwalker.blog 
* {{cleverdevil}} uses micro.blog/cleverdevil to syndicate several of the feeds from his self-hosted Known site https://cleverdevil.io.
** I've also been working with the JSON Feed community to see if additional content types can be represented - https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues/51
* {{eli_oat}} uses micro.blog/eli to syndicate content from his self-hosted website, https://eli.li
* {{matthiasott}} uses micro.blog/matthiasott to syndicate the microblog JSON feed from his website, https://matthiasott.com/microblog
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} uses [https://micro.blog/eddiehinkle micro.blog/eddiehinkle] as a possible [[syndication]] target when posting to his website. When a post is marked to be syndicated to Micro.blog, it is added to a RSS feed that his Micro.blog account consumes.
* {{gRegor}} uses https://micro.blog/gRegorLove to automatically syndicate his [[notes]] via [[Atom]] feed.
* {{amitgawande}} uses his [https://micro.blog/amit Micro.blog profile] to syndicate the journal and long-form posts from the self-hosted [https://amitgawande.com Hugo-built website] via RSS feed
* {{Islandinthenet.com}} uses his [https://micro.blog/khurt Micro.blog profile] to syndicate the journal and long-form posts from the self-hosted [https://islandinthenet.com/ WordPress website] via RSS feed
* {{addyourself}}

== Getting Help ==
Discussion directly centered around the project as well as help/support, and reporting bugs can be found on [https://microblogging.slack.com multiple Micro.blog specific Slack channels]. Bugs can also be reported on [https://github.com/microdotblog/issues/ Github].

== Features ==
=== Posts ===
Micro.blog currently supports several types of [[posts]]:
* [[note]]
* [[photo]]
* [[article]]

=== Personal domain ===
One can map over their [[personal-domain]] using CNAME as described [http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/ here]. This will allow you to own the URLs relating to the service; doing so will make it possible for you to move to another [[CMS]] in the future if you wish.

=== Themes ===
A variety of [[mf2]] compatible themes are included with paid subscriptions that use the hosted service. At launch none would pass the [[Indiewebify.me]] tests as they didn't include h-card or h-entry, but they're improving support over time. They do have h-feed and h-entry as of 2017-05-02.

=== Avatars ===
Avatars on the service use [[Gravatar]] as described in the [http://help.micro.blog/2015/profile-photos/ help pages].

=== Rel-me ===
The hosted version of Micro.blog supports [[rel-me]] fields for one's primary website as well as for [[Twitter]] and [[GitHub]]. Putting your hosted Micro.blog URL into your Twitter and GitHub account "Web Site" fields on their respective account settings pages and putting your usernames into the Micro.blog fields at http://micro.blog/account/apps and saving will allow one to easily and quickly [http://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=micro.blog log into the Indieweb wiki] using [[IndieAuth]].

As of early July 2017 Micro.blog supports [[rel-me]] with Instagram as well as support for micropub client [[OwnYourGram]].

=== Website Verification for non-hosted blogs ===
Details for verifying one's non-hosted site can be found at http://help.micro.blog/2017/web-site-verification/

=== Syndication ===
==== from Micro.blog ====
Micro.blog supports [[POSSE]] to [http://help.micro.blog/2016/cross-posting-twitter/ Twitter] with a paid account and also supports other services for free via [http://help.micro.blog/2015/cross-posting-ifttt/ IFTTT].

==== into Micro.blog ====
The service allows one to configure multiple [[RSS]] feeds to syndicate content into the service.

== Apps ==
=== Micropub ===
Because Micro.blog supports [[Micropub]] a variety of [[Micropub/Clients|clients]], including [[Quill]] can be used to post to it.

=== MacOS Desktop Client ===
[http://matthewroach.me/ Matthew Roach] has built a [http://matthewroach.me/micro-blog-desktop/ MacOS desktop client] on the electron framework using the Micro.blog API. A request has been made for it to support micropub. Currently you can follow your timeline, see you mentions and favorites and reply to posts.

* [https://github.com/davidkrauser/MicroPost MicroPost] A simple Android app to post to Micro.blog

== Use with other Projects ==
One can register a username on the site for free and syndicate content into it via RSS, Atom, or JSONfeed.

Various projects can easily support posting into the ecosystem. Some being seen in the early days of the service (with posts/details/code about custom set ups) include:

=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] is one of the more common platforms in use with Micro.blog, including by its founder [http://www.manton.org/ Manton Reece] who self-hosts and uses a slightly modified version of the Twenty Twelve theme.

==== Code / Plugins ====
* [https://github.com/kjohnson/wp-micro-posts WP Micro Posts] - Adds a "Micro" post type for Indie Microblogging with WordPress.
* [https://github.com/glueckpress/micro.blog glueckpress Micro.blog] - WordPress plugin to generate a custom RSS feed. Adds a checkbox to the Publish meta box to add a post to the custom feed. Built with https://micro.blog/ in mind.

== Criticism ==
While the service includes a lot of value and is easy to configure and use, it has the following disadvantages:
* It only supports [[notes]], and (since late 2017) [[photos]] & [[articles]]
* It isn't (yet?) open source to allow users to add their own functionality if they wish
* Self-hosting isn't available, though one can map their own [[personal-domain]] to it.
* Outbound webmentions are fully supported but only incoming webmentions from sites which have registered on the service using their sending base URL.
* Data export isn't supported at launch, although is expected to be supported shortly
* There doesn't seem to be a simple way to natively post replies (either with the hosted or non-hosted versions) in a way which allows the user to thread replies properly and still own the content of the reply.
* Timeline, mentions, and favorites pages require Javascript. Without Javascript, the top navigation loads, but no Micro.blog posts. See [[js;dr]]
* presentation of posts from feeds depends on the title - if the post title is not a date "YYYY-MM-DD", Micro.blog only shows a link to the post. A pure date is often a bad title on the source site.
* Server load occasionally causes a backlog of webmentions that extend longer than 24 hours
* Posting on one's website and syndicating via a feed can often take several minutes to several hours depending on server loads.

== FAQ ==

=== Is there a self-hosted version of Micro.blog? ===
'''Q:''' Is there a self-hosted version of Micro.blog? [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-14#t1484391374044000]

'''A:''' Not currently. You can map your domain to Micro.blog or run your blog on your own domain and syndicate to Micro.blog via [[RSS]]. The Micro.blog platform is not currently open source, although maybe eventually will be. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-14#t1484404128247000]

=== Is Micro.blog an example of an [[reader|integrated reader]]? ===
'''Q:''' Is Micro.blog an example of an [[reader|integrated reader]]? (Also: Can you follow external feeds on Micro.blog?) - Asked in #indiechat, so not logged.

'''A:''' Micro.blog's reader only displays content from other Micro.blog users. To read a feed via Micro.blog, the publisher of that feed must create a user account on Micro.blog and syndicate their content there.
* Potentially confusing wording on the Micro.blog [http://micro.blog/about about page] on 2017-06-21 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170621173422/http://micro.blog/about archive.org copy]): <blockquote>Integrated timeline from blogs<br />Browse posts from friends, powered by RSS and indie microblogs.</blockquote>
* However, the [http://micro.blog/discover discover page] appears to only allow users to find other users on the site.
