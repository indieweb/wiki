'''<dfn>[http://micro.blog Micro.blog]</dfn>''' is a website and social service started by {{manton}}, which natively supports IndieWeb [[building-blocks]] like [[microformats|microformats2]], [[Webmention]], and [[Micropub]]. Originally started as a microblogging service, it now offers the ability to post [[notes]], [[articles]], [[podcast|podcasts]], and [[photos]].

== Overview ==
The [[Hugo]]-based ([https://www.manton.org/2019/01/30/custom-templates-categories.html previously] [[Jekyll]]-based) service supports posting of [[notes]] (up to 280 characters). [[photos|Photos]] can be posted to the service (using Micropub) or pulled in via [[RSS]].

The project was launched in beta on 2017-04-23 following a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing Kickstarter campaign] beginning in January 2017 in which 3,080 backers pledged $86,696. The project was originally called [http://www.manton.org/2016/07/pre-announcing-snippets-today.html Snippets.today].

One can bring their own [[projects|project]] and [[personal-domain]] to the service and post to it via RSS or purchase a hosted microblog for $5/month with a free 10-day trial.

How micro.blog is different from [[App.net]] and other attempts:
* ðŸ“ƒ 2018-02-01 Brent Simmons: [http://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net Why Micro.blog is Not Another App.net]<blockquote>Micro.blog is not an alternative silo: instead, itâ€™s what you build when you believe that the web itself is the great social network.</blockquote>
* ðŸ“ƒ 2018-07-02 {{manton}}: [http://manton.micro.blog/2018/07/02/193738.html The web is the social network] <blockquote>Micro.blog is one of the first platforms to focus on domain names that decouple the timeline from post storage. Anyone can post a Micro.blog-hosted site at their own domain name today and move it all somewhere else tomorrow. Itâ€™s a simple, IndieWeb-friendly architecture that we think is essential to the next phase of the web.</blockquote>

__TOC__

== Why ==
Micro.blog is a great way to get started on the IndieWeb and reach a thoughtful community in several ways:

# '''Want to try out the IndieWeb without a domain?''' If you don't have a domain name but want to try out some of the features of the IndieWeb, you can create a Micro.blog account, follow folks there, and reply to posts both on Micro.blog and elsewhere on the IndieWeb. If you decide to get a domain name, Micro.blog will help you transition to using it with their site (see 2), or even export your posts to a new site of your own which you can connect to your Micro.blog account (see 3).
# '''Have a domain name but no site yet?''' For those without a primary website, they can register a domain and connect it to Micro.blog as a hosting service for a minimal per month fee. Micro.blog will then allow them to post [[note|notes]], [[article|articles]], [[photo|photos]], and other types of posts easily. If they choose, there's excellent import/export to allow them to relatively easily swap platforms.
# '''Have a site already?''' For those who already have a primary website on another service or platform, they can easily syndicate their content (via [[RSS]] or [[JSON]]) into the Micro.blog service and use the service's reader to interact with other users while still owning their own content and receiving replies/comments via webmention. If their site also supports micropub, they can utilize the service to compose their content and micropub it to their own site after which it will appear on Micro.blog via feed.

== Indieweb Examples ==
* {{manton}} [https://manton.org/2018/07/08/migrated-mantonorg-to.html migrated his primary domain manton.org to Micro.blog] hosting (from self-hosted [[WordPress]]). '''[[selfdogfood]]ing'''
* {{aaronpk}} uses micro.blog/aaronpk to automatically syndicate his main aaronparecki.com website feed
* {{t}} uses micro.blog/t to automatically syndicate his main tantek.com website feed file (updates.atom)
* {{chrisaldrich}} - experimenting with a [https://c.micro.blog hosted site] (during beta roll-out at least to see how well it supports IndieWeb)
** I've mapped over my [[personal-domain]] using CNAME as described [http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/ here].
** It includes the RSS feed of my [[Known]] site which feeds those status updates into the system. People who reply on them within Micro.blog send [[webmention|webmentions]] back to the original post in a straightforward manner. WordPress RSS feeds work similarly.
* {{jeremycherfas}} uses micro.blog/jeremycherfas to syndicate portions of https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/ feed and posts from https://jeremycherfas.net 
* {{colinwalker}} uses micro.blog/colinwalker to syndicate the main feed from the self-hosted WordPress blog https://colinwalker.blog 
* {{cleverdevil}} uses micro.blog/cleverdevil to syndicate several of the feeds from his self-hosted Known site https://cleverdevil.io.
** I've also been working with the JSON Feed community to see if additional content types can be represented - https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues/51
* {{eli_oat}} uses micro.blog/eli to syndicate content from his self-hosted website, https://eli.li
* {{matthiasott}} uses micro.blog/matthiasott to syndicate the microblog JSON feed from his website, https://matthiasott.com/microblog
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} uses [https://micro.blog/eddiehinkle micro.blog/eddiehinkle] as a possible [[syndication]] target when posting to his website. When a post is marked to be syndicated to Micro.blog, it is added to a RSS feed that his Micro.blog account consumes.
* {{gRegor}} uses https://micro.blog/gRegorLove to automatically syndicate his [[notes]] via [[Atom]] feed.
* {{amitgawande}} uses his [https://micro.blog/amit Micro.blog profile] to syndicate the journal and long-form posts from the self-hosted [https://amitgawande.com Hugo-built website] via RSS feed
* {{Islandinthenet.com}} uses his [https://micro.blog/khurtwilliams Micro.blog profile] to syndicate the journal and long-form posts from the self-hosted [https://islandinthenet.com/ WordPress website] via JSON feed
* {{rose}} uses micro.blog/rosemaryorchard to syndicate her "micro" feed from her website, including cross posting to Twitter and Mastodon, as well as to share her blog feed.
* {{frank}} uses https://micro.blog/frank to syndicate the main feed from [https://diggingthedigital.com/ his self-hosted WordPress blog]
* {{kimberlyhirsh}} [https://kimberlyhirsh.com/2020/01/06/migrating-my-site.html migrated her domain to Micro.blog hosting] (from self-hosted [[WordPress]]).
* {{addyourself}}

== Getting Help ==
Discussion directly centered around the project as well as help/support, and reporting bugs can be found on [https://microblogging.slack.com multiple Micro.blog specific Slack channels]. Bugs can also be reported on [https://github.com/microdotblog/issues/ Github]. Micro.blog has a [http://help.micro.blog/ help page] on its website with additional details and assistance. There is also a [http://micro.blog/help help account] on the service itself that can respond to queries.

== Features ==
=== Posts ===
Micro.blog currently supports several types of [[posts]]:
* [[note]]
* [[photo]]
* [[article]]
* [[podcast]]

=== Personal domain ===
One can map over their [[personal-domain]] using CNAME as described [http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/ here]. This will allow you to own the URLs relating to the service; doing so will make it possible for you to move to another [[CMS]] in the future if you wish.

=== Themes ===
A variety of [[mf2]] compatible themes are included with paid subscriptions that use the hosted service. At launch none would pass the [[Indiewebify.me]] tests as they didn't include h-card or h-entry, but they're improving support over time. They do have h-feed and h-entry as of 2017-05-02.

Creating or copying custom themes:

* Minus
* Hello

=== Avatars ===
Avatars on the service use [[Gravatar]] as described in the [http://help.micro.blog/2015/profile-photos/ help pages]. Users can also upload a custom photo, which will be stored on Micro.blog and used instead of Gravatar.

=== Website Verification for non-hosted blogs ===
Details for verifying one's non-hosted site can be found at http://help.micro.blog/2017/web-site-verification/

=== Syndication ===
==== from Micro.blog ====
Micro.blog supports [[POSSE]] to [http://help.micro.blog/2016/cross-posting-twitter/ Twitter] with a paid account and also supports other services for free via [http://help.micro.blog/2015/cross-posting-ifttt/ IFTTT].

==== into Micro.blog ====
The service allows one to configure multiple [[RSS]] or [[JSON feed]]s to syndicate content into the service. To [[cross-post]] or [[syndicate]] from your blog to Micro.blog using [[POSSE]]:
* add your [[feed file]] URL to your Micro.blog profile

How to set up Micro.blog to check your feed file automatically after creating a POSSE'd post in WordPress:
* add https://micro.blog/ping on a separate line in the Update Services section of the Writing Settings page

=== Feed reader ===
By having an account and following other users on the platform, the main page becomes a chronological feed of posts from those accounts. (see also [[Micro.blog#Is_Micro.blog_an_example_of_an_integrated_reader.3F|Is Micro.blog an example of an integrated reader?]] below.

If you'd like to put a feed of sites you're following on micro.blog into another [[feed reader]], there is an available [[JSON feed]] that uses the following URL format <code><nowiki>https://micro.blog/feeds/username.json</nowiki></code> where one can replace `username` with their micro.blog account username to read in other locations.

=== IndieWeb Features ===
IndieWeb [[building blocks]] supported by Micro.blog in addition to [[permalinks]], [[Webmention]], and [[Micropub]]:
==== Rel-me ====
The hosted version of Micro.blog supports [[rel-me]] fields for one's primary website as well as for [[Twitter]] and [[GitHub]]. Putting your hosted Micro.blog URL into your Twitter and GitHub account "Web Site" fields on their respective account settings pages and putting your usernames into the Micro.blog fields at http://micro.blog/account/apps and saving will allow one to easily and quickly [http://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=micro.blog log into the Indieweb wiki].

As of early July 2017 Micro.blog supports [[rel-me]] with Instagram as well as support for micropub client [[OwnYourGram]].

==== IndieAuth ====
Since July 2018, Micro.blog is its own [[IndieAuth]] provider. This means people logging in to the IndieWeb wiki, or using apps like [[OwnYourGram]] can sign in just using their micro.blog account without relying on rel=me links to Twitter or other services. See also: https://manton.micro.blog/2018/07/02/indieauth-for-microblog.html


==== Feature Requests ====
* Goal: Be able to use micro.blog as my authentication for signing into the wiki (and thus be a [[RelMeAuth]] authentication provider for use by [[IndieLogin]] and any other RelMeAuth consuming implementation)
** [[rel-me]] support on all profiles (not just hosted) with a "Website" field value.
*** e.g. my account (edited at https://micro.blog/account) has Website: [ http://tantek.com/ ] configured, but the link to tantek.com on my profile https://micro.blog/t does not have rel=me (it should)
** [[RelMeAuth]]
** May need some custom code in [[IndieLogin]]

== Apps ==
=== Micropub ===
Because Micro.blog supports [[Micropub]] a variety of [[Micropub/Clients|clients]], including [[Quill]] can be used to post to it.
{{main|Micropub/Clients}}

=== iOS === 
The [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8 Micro.blog app] is open source and available in the App Store. 
* https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-ios

There are also official open source micro.blog iOS apps specifically for:
* photos: [[Sunlit]]
* short podcasts/microcasts: [[Wavelength]]

3rd party iOS apps:
* [https://gluon.app/ Gluon] is a customizable cross platform app built for Micro.blog.

=== MarsEdit ===
Paid users of the service can use [http://help.micro.blog/2015/using-marsedit/ MarsEdit] to post to the service.

== Use with other Projects ==
One can register a username on the site for free and syndicate content into it via [[RSS]], Atom, or [[JSON feed]].

Various [[projects]] can easily support posting into the ecosystem. Some being seen in the early days of the service (with posts/details/code about custom set ups) include:

=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] is one of the more common platforms in use with Micro.blog. Its founder {{manton}} previously self-hosted with WordPress using a slightly modified version of the Twenty Twelve theme before moving his site completely to micro.blog.

=== Known ===
[[Known]] can be used almost out of the box to self-host a microblog and easily syndicate content from status updates directly into Micro.blog via RSS (typically with a URL of the form http://knownexample.com/content/statusupdates/?_t=rss). Other post types can by syndicated as well.

=== GitHub Pages ===
Details for setting up [[github-pages|GitHub Pages]] can be found [http://help.micro.blog/2016/mirroring-to-github/ here].

=== Hugo ===
While micro.blog is built on [[Hugo]] and supports Webmentions to and from sites with micro.blog accounts, Steve Layton wrote about adding (universal) [https://shindakun.dev/posts/adding-webmentions-to-microblog/ Webmention support into Micro.blog with Hugo].

== Criticism ==
While the service includes a lot of value and is easy to configure and use, it has the following disadvantages:
* It only supports [[notes]], (since late 2017) [[photos]] & [[articles]], and (since 2018) [[podcast|podcasts]].
* It isn't (yet?) open source to allow users to add their own functionality if they wish.
* Self-hosting isn't available, though one can map their own [[personal-domain]] to Micro.blog hosting, or connect Micro.blog to a self-hosted external site using a different platform.
* Outbound webmentions are fully supported but only incoming webmentions from sites which have registered on the service using their sending base URL.
* Posts can be exported in WordPress format, replies exported in JSON Feed, but there is currently not a single archive for exporting all data.
* Timeline, mentions, and favorites pages require Javascript. Without Javascript, the top navigation loads, but no Micro.blog posts. See [[js;dr]]
* Presentation of posts from feeds depends on the title - if the post title is not a date "YYYY-MM-DD", Micro.blog only shows a link to the post. A pure date is often a bad title on the source site.
* Server load occasionally causes a backlog of webmentions that extend longer than 24 hours
* Posting on one's website and syndicating via a feed can often take several minutes to several hours depending on server loads.

== FAQ ==

=== Is there a self-hosted version of Micro.blog? ===
'''Q:''' Is there a self-hosted version of Micro.blog? [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-14#t1484391374044000]

'''A:''' Not currently. You can map your domain to Micro.blog or run your blog on your own domain and syndicate to Micro.blog via [[RSS]]. The Micro.blog platform is not currently open source, although maybe eventually will be. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-14#t1484404128247000]

=== Is Micro.blog an example of an [[reader|integrated reader]]? ===
'''Q:''' Is Micro.blog an example of an [[reader|integrated reader]]? (Also: Can you follow external feeds on Micro.blog?) - Asked in #indiechat, so not logged.

'''A:''' Micro.blog's reader only displays content from other Micro.blog users. To read a feed via Micro.blog, the publisher of that feed must create a user account on Micro.blog and syndicate their content there.
* Potentially confusing wording on the Micro.blog [http://micro.blog/about about page] on 2017-06-21 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170621173422/http://micro.blog/about archive.org copy]): <blockquote>Integrated timeline from blogs<br />Browse posts from friends, powered by RSS and indie microblogs.</blockquote>
* However, the [http://micro.blog/discover discover page] appears to only allow users to find other users on the site.
