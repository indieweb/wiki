== What is the IndieWeb? ==
<span class="p-summary">The <a class="u-url p-name" href="/IndieWeb"><dfn>IndieWeb</dfn></a> is a people-focused alternative to the ‚Äúcorporate web‚Äù.</span>

'''We are a community of independent and personal websites''' based on the [[principles]] of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content.

=== Your content is yours ===
When you post something on the web, it should [[own your data|belong to you]], not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and [[site-deaths|lost all of their users‚Äô data]]. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.

[[File:homepage-connected.svg|frameless|80px|left|alt=Connected network icon|class=iwc-homepage__icon|link=]]
=== You are better connected ===
Your articles and status messages can [[POSSE|be distributed to any platform]], not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Replies and likes on other services can [[backfeed|come back to your site]] so they‚Äôre all in one place.

[[File:homepage-control.svg|80px|frameless|left|alt=Steering wheel icon|class=iwc-homepage__icon|link=]]
=== You are in control ===
You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as ''example.com/ideas''. These links are [[permalinks|permanent]] and will always work.

== üìù Blog With Us Monthly ==
We have a number of monthly collaborative [[blog carnival]]s that you can join by posting on your own site! Each month features a different topic, theme, or movie to blog:
* '''[[IndieWeb Carnival]]'''

== üóΩ Beyond Blogging and Decentralization ==
The IndieWeb effort is [[different]] from previous efforts/communities:
* '''[[Principles]]''' over project-centrism. Others assume a [[monoculture]] of one project for all. We are developing a [[pluralism|plurality of approaches and projects]]. The IndieWeb community has a [[code-of-conduct]]. 
* '''[[use what you make|Publish on your site]]'''. Show before tell. Prioritize by [[make what you need|making what you need]], [[create|creating]], iterating on your site.
* '''[[Design]]''' first, protocols and formats second. Focus on creating a good user experience and [[use what you make|using your own prototype features]] to focus on minimum necessary [[formats]] and [[protocols]].
* '''Simpler [[building blocks]]'''. When necessary, we adopt, improve, and create open [[standards]] for good design, user experience, and ease of implementation.

Perhaps most importantly, we are people-focused instead of project-focused. We have [https://events.indieweb.org/ regular meetups]. All are welcome. You don't need to have a website to join, but you should be interested in personal websites!
