'''<dfn>MVF</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for minimum viable feature, the concept and methodology of designing, developing, and deploying the simplest possible (often seemingly incomplete in comparison to others) but still usable variant of a new feature for a site or product as a means to shipping quickly and iterating based on actual (preferably [[selfdogfood]]) use and experience rather than overdesigning up front and never finishing coding.
