'''<dfn>[https://monocle.p3k.io Monocle]</dfn>''' is an open source IndieWeb-enabled [[reader]] developed by {{aaronpk}}. It is a [[Microsub]] client, and so it does not handle any feed parsing or storage on its own.

Source code:

* Monocle does not store any data itself, it is only a frontend to a [[Microsub]] server

== Previously ==
Previously, Monocle was launched as a full reader and feed parser, but in April 26, 2016 was [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/26/3/monocle/ taken offline]. Development was restarted in 2018 and Monocle is now purely a front-end for a Microsub server.
