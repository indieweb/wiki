{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Monocle</dfn>''' is an open source IndieWeb-enabled [[reader]] developed by {{aaronpk}}. It is a [[Microsub]] client, and so it does not handle any feed parsing or storage on its own.

On April 26, 2016, Monocle was [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/26/3/monocle/ taken offline] to come back in a different incarnation in the future.

== Brainstorming ==
* Main UI paradigm is channels like an IRC client
* Sidebar of channel list (hidden on small screens, slides out from the left)
** see glowing-bear.org for an example
* No storage of any data, this is only a frontend to a [[Microsub]] server
