== Features ==

* Monocle does not store any data itself, it is only a frontend to a [[Microsub]] server

== Previously ==
Previously, Monocle was launched as a full reader and feed parser, but in April 26, 2016 was [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/26/3/monocle/ taken offline]. Development was restarted in 2018 and Monocle is now purely a front-end for a Microsub server.
