__TOC__
== POSSE ==
It is possible to automatically (via [[IFTTT]]) and manually POSSE articles to Medium.

=== Automatic POSSE ===


From: https://medium.com/@saul/creating-medium-stories-via-rss-c2ac93d08288
UPDATE: There is no longer a publish from RSS trigger on IFTT
UPDATE: Medium removed access to their publishing API

* Create and sign into your Medium and [[IFTTT]] accounts
* Make sure you have a valid [[RSS]] (or possibly [[Atom]] per IFTTT's feed channel which allows it) feed containing accepted markup.
** [https://medium.com/developers/accepted-markup-for-medium-s-publishing-api-a4367010924e Accepted markup for Medium’s Publishing API]
** h1, h2, p, blockquote, figure (img, figcaption), b, strong, i, em, a href, hr (section break)
* Go to the [https://ifttt.com/medium Medium Channel on IFTTT], click Connect.
* Go to the [https://ifttt.com/recipes/331247-create-a-medium-story-from-an-rss-feed RSS-to-Medium recipe] and click the gray Advanced Settings link underneath the blue Add button.
* Put your feed URL into field "Paste a Feed URL here".
* Click Add button

Updates occur every 15 minutes

=== Manual POSSE ===
# Publish on your own site. Copy the permanent link's URL. 
# Click on your avatar in the top right corner.
# Click on Import story.
# Paste in the URL.
# Edit the post on Medium if it took in a footer or put content in the wrong place (a header into the Medium title, for example).

Medium will automatically add an “Originally published at” note to the bottom of the post. It will also add a <code>rel="canonical"</code> link to the page pointing to your original post, making it so parsers know to get the post from your website when they are looking for the canonical version.

=== WordPress Plugin ===

*Update the WordPress plugin has been deprecated and will no longer be supported. This maybe related to Medium shutting down their write API.
<blockquote>
Unfortunately, we are unable to support the WordPress plug-in any further. As this is an open-source tool, we suggest you file a ticket for the community to review and fix. Additionally, you can always manually import your stories into Medium using our import tool:
https://medium.com/p/import I am sorry for the inconvenience, and if you have any specific questions please let me know.<cite><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/token-doesnt-have-necessary-permissions-for-wordpress/">Medium WordPress.org Plugin Support Page</a></cite></blockquote>

=== POSSEing likes ===
If you post a [[like]] of a Medium article, what is the best way to POSSE that like to Medium?

* [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/712

== Exporting your data ==
=== Official Export ===
[https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214043918-Export-content Official documentation]. Export format is HTML with microformats
* go to https://medium.com/me/export
* click the export button
* wait for an email
* click the link to download a .zip file full of HTML documents
* these have a footer appended linking to the medium url that has the date exported
* they break embedded tweets and youtube videos,
* they replace external links with a redirect to a /r/?url= link that obviously doesn't work locally or on a server without you adding code

=== Medium-to-Markdown ===
[[Python]] script to output a Markdown version of a Medium post: https://github.com/markbiek/Medium-To-Markdown (If you have experience using this, please make notes here.)

=== API is write-only ===
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/majelbstoat">@majelbstoat</a> is the medium API write only? There&#39;s no docs on fetching posts, only creating them.</p>&mdash; Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/712403179833430016">March 22, 2016</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a> For the time being, yes. Going to approach that thoughtfully, recognising that lots of APIs have given and then taken away.</p>&mdash; Jamie Talbot (@majelbstoat) <a href="https://twitter.com/majelbstoat/status/712403836925640704">March 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

== Issues ==
=== buggy rel-canonical implementation ===
If you set the rel-canonical for a post on Medium using their API, it both fails to do so correctly, and then resets (via JS?) the rel=canonical link to a medium.com URL, not what you set it to.

* Details: https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs/issues/19

=== Downtime ===
* 2016-03-03 the homepage returned the [[HTTP 500]] error below. The link "interesting to read" was to https://medium.com/top-100, which also failed intermittently.
** [[File:medium-down-2016-03-03.png]]

=== Nagware ===
Since at least 2017-08-19 Medium started showing modal popup [[nagware]] when viewing an article after you have read some number of articles that month. The dialog tells you how many Medium posts you've read to guilt you into signing up. (current limit is 3)

==== Nagware modal 2018-05-29 ====
Note the now 3 (used to be 14) articles per month limit [https://twitter.com/geddski/status/1001590716265512961 since at least 2018-05-29], likely earlier.

[https://twitter.com/geddski/status/1001590716265512961 <img style="max-width:100%" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DeZdWYjVQAIQw2e.jpg" alt="Medium Nagware screenshot showing a modal obscuring the article saying you have read 3 articles and must now sign-up" />]

From tweet: https://twitter.com/geddski/status/1001590716265512961 since at least 2018-05-29 <blockquote>"2017: maybe I should just use medium instead of my own custom blog?<br><br>2018: whew"</blockquote> — [https://twitter.com/geddski @geddski] May 29, 2018

==== Nagware modal 2017-08-19 ====
Note the 14 articles per month limit since at least 2017-08-19, perhaps earlier.

== Criticism ==
* Medium may have shut down their publishing API for third-party developers [https://twitter.com/macguru17/status/1088387105519255553].
** Update: Medium announced that they identified a spam vectore in the publishing API and had to revoke tokens. People can recreate apps for publishing [https://twitter.com/MediumSupport/status/1092382171397005312]
* 2010-07-10 http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2010/11/07/no-more-sharecropping
** POSSEd to Medium: https://medium.com/indieweb-thoughts/9d0e36524dbf
* 2014-05-30 [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-30/line/1401478311 Medium doesn't support footnotes]
* 2014-06-09 Medium does not appear to show the full published date in the visible content. Instead there is a [[The-Open-Graph-protocol|Open Graph Protocol]] meta element: <code>meta property="article:published_time" content="2014-01-16T08:59:18.300Z"</code>
** Example: https://medium.com/binary-times/use-your-own-product-or-die-ba3e2d738a55
** It appears that the year is displayed depending how recent the article is. A 2013 article linked above includes the year in the visible content, but as of this writing (2014-06), the example link only shows "Jan 16," because it is recently published, in the current year.

=== Lightweight Marketing Articles ===
More of a criticism of *reading* Medium (e.g. clicking links through to Medium posts)
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13570227: <blockquote>The articles on medium.com seem to be lightweight, designed for marketing purposes. All carbs, no protein.</blockquote> … <blockquote>Lately it seems they are very much marketing pieces</blockquote>
** more criticisms there that could be extracted and quoted like bad TOR UX, 'they do signal "low-quality"' / "not enough real world depth of experience behind them", iOS app crashes "using an iphone 4s with ios8 and medium crashes"
