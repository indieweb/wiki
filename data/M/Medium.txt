'''<dfn>[http://medium.com Medium]</dfn>''' is an [[article]] hosting [[silo]], and as of June 2016, the owner of [[Superfeedr]][https://medium.com/superfeedr-thoughts/medium-acquires-superfeedr-540fdfb04ec7].

== Why not ==
Why not to use Medium, see:
* [[#Issues]]
* [[#Criticism]]

== How to ==
=== How to migrate away ===
The best option to migrate away from Medium is currently [[micro.blog]].

Note that '''micro.blog''' explicitly has medium to long form blog posting support:
* https://help.micro.blog/2018/writing-longer-posts/

See https://help.micro.blog/2019/medium-import/ for instructions on how to migrate from Medium to micro.blog.

=== How to update canonical URLs ===
Medium can add a Canonical URL when importing posts. To update/set a canonical URL of an existing post, modify the story settings > Advanced Settings > Customize Canonical Link [https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033930293-Set-a-canonical-link]. This will help sites know that your site is the primary version of the content.

== Features ==
Medium provides the following features:

* The ability to use one's custom [[domain name]] 
** n.b. They've [https://blog.medium.com/custom-domains-are-back-2dee29560d59 had this feature in the past and removed it].
* Ability to [[import]] and [[export]] one's content
* [[signup]] &amp; [[login]] with [[Twitter]] sign-in
** indieweb equivalent: [[signin]] via [[RelMeAuth]] or [[IndieAuth]]
* [[post]] an [[article]]
* [[recommend]] (their equivalent of [[like]]) an article that you've just read
* add an article to a curated publication (requires approval from the publication owner)
* inline/per-paragraph/side [[comments]]
* [[profile]] page (equivalent of indieweb [[homepage]]) configuration including
** [[icon]] (from Twitter)
** name (from Twitter)
** plain text bio (from Twitter)
** ...
* API announced on [https://medium.com/the-story/medium-s-publishing-api-31b9f05fada1 2015-10-07], including an [https://github.com/Medium/medium-wordpress-plugin official cross-post plugin] for [[WordPress]] and an [[IFTTT]] channel
* Algorithmically generated [[recommendations]] based on a signed-in user's reading
__TOC__

== POSSE ==
It is possible to manually POSSE articles to Medium via their import tool. Automatic publishing tools that previously worked were shut down around 2017.

=== Manual POSSE ===
# Publish on your own site. Copy the permanent link's URL. 
# Click on your avatar in the top right corner.
# Click on Import story.
# Paste in the URL.
# Edit the post on Medium if it took in a footer or put content in the wrong place (a header into the Medium title, for example).

Medium will automatically add an “Originally published at” note to the bottom of the post. It will also add a <code>rel="canonical"</code> link to the page pointing to your original post, making it so parsers know to get the post from your website when they are looking for the canonical version.

=== Automatic POSSE ===

As described in [https://medium.com/@saul/creating-medium-stories-via-rss-c2ac93d08288 Creating Medium stories via RSS], Medium used to have an [[IFTTT]] trigger which allowed publishing from RSS. However this has since been removed. Remy Sharp [https://remysharp.com/2018/02/01/how-to-cross-post-to-medium set up a cross-poster in 2018] but has not posted to Medium since 2020.

=== WordPress Plugin ===

*Update the WordPress plugin has been deprecated and will no longer be supported. This maybe related to Medium shutting down their write API.
<blockquote>
Unfortunately, we are unable to support the WordPress plug-in any further. As this is an open-source tool, we suggest you file a ticket for the community to review and fix. Additionally, you can always manually import your stories into Medium using our import tool:
https://medium.com/p/import I am sorry for the inconvenience, and if you have any specific questions please let me know.<cite><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/token-doesnt-have-necessary-permissions-for-wordpress/">Medium WordPress.org Plugin Support Page</a></cite></blockquote>

** POSSE copy: https://medium.com/@meyerweb/undoing-oncut-oncopy-onpaste-falsities-5e337cc443

He described his problems with the process in a follow up post that was first published on Medium and then manually [[PESOS|PESOSed]] back to his own blog, 2015-07-30:
* https://medium.com/@meyerweb/medium-trials-30cb485a92e7
** PESOS copy: http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2015/07/30/medium-trials/

==== David Mead ====

=== POSSEing likes ===
If you post a [[like]] of a Medium article, what is the best way to POSSE that like to Medium?

* [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/712

== Exporting your data ==
=== Official Export ===
[https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214043918-Export-content Official documentation]. Export format is HTML with microformats
* go to https://medium.com/me/export
* click the export button
* wait for an email
* click the link to download a .zip file full of HTML documents
* these have a footer appended linking to the medium url that has the date exported
* they break embedded tweets and youtube videos,
* they replace external links with a redirect to a /r/?url= link that obviously doesn't work locally or on a server without you adding code

=== Medium-to-Markdown ===
[[Python]] script to output a Markdown version of a Medium post: https://github.com/markbiek/Medium-To-Markdown (If you have experience using this, please make notes here.)

=== API is write-only ===
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/majelbstoat">@majelbstoat</a> is the medium API write only? There&#39;s no docs on fetching posts, only creating them.</p>&mdash; Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/712403179833430016">March 22, 2016</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a> For the time being, yes. Going to approach that thoughtfully, recognising that lots of APIs have given and then taken away.</p>&mdash; Jamie Talbot (@majelbstoat) <a href="https://twitter.com/majelbstoat/status/712403836925640704">March 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

== Issues ==
=== buggy rel-canonical implementation ===
If you set the rel-canonical for a post on Medium using their API, it both fails to do so correctly, and then resets (via JS?) the rel=canonical link to a medium.com URL, not what you set it to.

* Details: https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs/issues/19

=== Downtime ===
* 2016-03-03 the homepage returned the [[HTTP 500]] error below. The link "interesting to read" was to https://medium.com/top-100, which also failed intermittently.
** [[File:medium-down-2016-03-03.png]]

=== Nagware ===
Since at least 2017-08-19 Medium started showing modal popup [[nagware]] when viewing an article after you have read some number of articles that month. The dialog tells you how many Medium posts you've read to guilt you into signing up. (current limit is 3)

==== Nagware modal 2024-03-12 ====
On mobile:

On desktop:

[[File:medium-modal-timbl.png|600px]]

==== Nagware modal 2018-05-29 ====
Note the now 3 (used to be 14) articles per month limit [https://twitter.com/geddski/status/1001590716265512961 since at least 2018-05-29], likely earlier.

From tweet: https://twitter.com/geddski/status/1001590716265512961 since at least 2018-05-29 <blockquote>"2017: maybe I should just use medium instead of my own custom blog?<br><br>2018: whew"</blockquote> — [https://twitter.com/geddski @geddski] May 29, 2018

==== Nagware modal 2017-08-19 ====
Note the 14 articles per month limit since at least 2017-08-19, perhaps earlier.

== Criticism ==
* Medium may have shut down their publishing API for third-party developers [https://twitter.com/macguru17/status/1088387105519255553].
** Update: Medium announced that they identified a spam vectore in the publishing API and had to revoke tokens. People can recreate apps for publishing [https://twitter.com/MediumSupport/status/1092382171397005312]
* 2010-07-10 http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2010/11/07/no-more-sharecropping
** POSSEd to Medium: https://medium.com/indieweb-thoughts/9d0e36524dbf
* 2014-05-30 [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-30/line/1401478311 Medium doesn't support footnotes]
* 2014-06-09 Medium does not appear to show the full published date in the visible content. Instead there is a [[The-Open-Graph-protocol|Open Graph Protocol]] meta element: <code>meta property="article:published_time" content="2014-01-16T08:59:18.300Z"</code>
** Example: https://medium.com/binary-times/use-your-own-product-or-die-ba3e2d738a55
** It appears that the year is displayed depending how recent the article is. A 2013 article linked above includes the year in the visible content, but as of this writing (2014-06), the example link only shows "Jan 16," because it is recently published, in the current year.

* Criticism of separate Mastodon instance: bifurcating users's "Medium" identities across two accounts like that is not very user friendly, and adds the cognitive load of "which medium-ish thing/account should I post my medium-ish thoughts today?"
* ^ more criticism: feels a bit more knee-jerk FOMO-based launch than something well thought out with their existing service(s), community, etc. E.g. they could have instead deployed their own instance of [[Bridgy Fed]].

* criticism from Medium's current CEO https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34747015
** "I'm Medium's current CEO as of last July. I actually pay a lot of attention to this sentiment on Hacker News. For example, I've bookmarked and often share this recent HN poll where 88% of people here think there's a negative stigma to a medium article.<br>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33223222<br>It's sad and entirely our fault. We didn't fail but we did lose our way. Here's how I see it:<br>1. Lost our way on recommendations. When I showed up the company was convinced that engagement equals quality. That's not true and it gets even more pronounced if you pay people to game your recommendation system. I think we were boosting articles that made people think we were a site for clickbait. The canonical example for HN is "Why NodeJS is dead" by a new programmer with zero experience or context. Readers noticed this, but worse, so did authors. And so we lost the incentive for a lot of the best and most interesting authors to bother because they were getting swamped by content-mill type authors. As of December, about 30% of our recommendations are generated by a new system that is picking much higher quality articles that have been vetted for substance over clickbait. This is getting a lot better, rapidly.<br>2. Got lost thinking about the creator economy, when we should have kept thinking about doers. Distribution was our winning value proposition (on top of simple free tools). We were built to find and boost individual articles and that meant that anyone with something great to say had a chance to get their story boosted, often by a lot. This is my original background in publishing: working at O'Reilly helping them publish programming books that were written by programmers. For a lot of topics, personal experience trumps everything. Not to knock creators, but by definition full time content creation gets in the way of having personal experiences that are worth writing about. We are partly through fixing this and #1.<br>Those are the two most obvious ones. But then there's a longer list. We competed with our platform publishers by starting our own in house publications. Those are shut down now. We started but didn't finish a number of redesigns and so the tools didn't get better for a couple of years. We're past that now and are putting out table stakes features again and some innovations too.<br>What I told our investors was that there was a huge pile of shit to dig out of, but that it would be worthwhile eventually. And I still believe both that there is a lot more to do and also that it'll be worthwhile." [https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tonystubblebine @tonystubblebine] February 10, 2023
