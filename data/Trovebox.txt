'''<dfn>[https://github.com/photo Trovebox]</dfn>''' (formerly [http://theopenphotoproject.org OpenPhoto]) was a photo application [[project]] that lets you store your photos on Dropbox, Amazon S3 or in your garage, and serve them from URLs on your own domain. It was also an online service to "organize and share [[photos]] and [[videos]] with clients and colleagues". As of 2015-03-31, the online service at trovebox.com has been [[site-deaths#Trovebox|shut down]]. The code is open source, though, if you want to maintain a version on your own site.

Development on the open source, self-hosted "Trovebox Community Edition" appears to have slowed dramatically in [http://www.ohloh.net/p/openphoto mid-2013], possibly to focus on the commercial [http://trovebox.com Trovebox] product (Need more info on this).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWebCamp participants who are using it on their own site:
* [[User:Upon2020.com]] (Johannes Ernst) is running a private instance for his family pictures
* ...

=== Formerly ===
* [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]] (Barnaby Walters) http://waterpigs.co.uk/ was running an instance of Trovebox to host his photos at http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/ - it's now dead/offline, "pending transfer of relevant content to Taproot". <blockquote>I could probably attempt to debug the JS-related problem but would rather put that time into making getting Taproot displaying photo posts better. -Barnaby</blockquote>

== Criticism ==
=== Insufficient Selfdogfooding ===
Insufficient Selfdogfooding. Of the 13 "core team" creators listed on the site only one is self-hosting an instance of Trovebox/OpenPhoto. And it appears to be broken. (based on links from [http://theopenphotoproject.org/team http://theopenphotoproject.org/team] because there does not appear to be a list of Trovebox creators). No known functioning [[selfdogfood]]ing of Trovebox/OpenPhoto.

=== Poor odd image size handling ===
Poor small/odd image size handling - <blockquote>"I have found it sub-optimal for small images (it scales them up to horrible dimensions) and weirdly shaped images (screenshots/panoramas, both of which i do a lot)" - [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-04-16#t1366140083 Barnabywalters on IRC]</blockquote>

=== Poor integration ===
Poor integration - Trovebox fails to easily integrate with any other posting software, e.g. for posting [[notes]], [[articles]], and photos into a single stream on your homepage.

=== Poor stream management ===
Poor stream management - <blockquote>"it's fine as a full photo management stack, that's just not what I want in terms of publishing a photo stream." - [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-04-16#t1366140041 aaronpk on IRC]</blockquote>

=== Reliance on Javascript ===
Login and Gallery pages both rely on [[Javascript]] in order to function, and the latest checkout has several javascript bugs which prevent them from working correctly.
