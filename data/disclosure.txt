{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>disclosure</dfn>''' is a bit of content, typically on a [[home page]], on an indie web site that proactively discloses some aspect about the site that the site owner wants the user to explicitly be aware of. E.g.

* cookie tracking
* analytics
* affiliations with organizations (sometimes on specific [[posts]] that are topically related to those organizations)
* services provided, such as webmentions
* privacy policy, as it involves the above
* contact information is anything in the disclosure is incorrect

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Jeremy Zilar ===
{{jeremyzilar}} on his [http://silencematters.com/ silencematters.com] sidebar, has a Google Analytics disclosure and links to opt out and learn more: <blockquote>Note:<br/>I use Google Analytics to understand how people are using my website.<br/>Opt-out | Learn more</blockquote>

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} has a page on https://seblog.nl/privacy containing information about showing backfeed, citing posts, (no) tracking etc. since [https://seblog.nl/2017/02/18/2/day-34-privacy-policy 2017-02-18]. The page is linked in the footer of every page.

== Backfeed Examples ==
[[backfeed|Backfeed]], even from public silo profiles, may not be an obvious consequence by commenters/likers of [[POSSE]] copies. Thus it makes sense, especially for silo [[private account]]s and [[private post]]s by default, explicitly disclose on your silo profile that you are / may be backfeeding comments/likes etc. to your own site.

=== Kyle Mahan Instagram ===
{{kylewm}} has had a backfeed disclosure on his [[Instagram]] profile since 2015-??-??: <blockquote>heads up: images are also published on my personal site by #OwnYourGram. comments and likes are backfed by Brid.gy.</blockquote>

=== Tantek Facebook ===
{{t}} has had a backfeed disclosure on his [[Facebook]] profile "Intro" field since 2016-060: <blockquote>Posts here come from my site tantek.com <br/>Comments/likes may be copied to original posts & made public!</blockquote>

=== Kartik Prabhu Twitter ===
{{kartik}} has a backfeed disclosure on his [[Twitter]] profile since 2016-02-29: <blockquote>All responses backfed to my site. You have been warned!</blockquote>

=== Michael Bishop ===
{{miklb}} I have a pinned post on Twitter, and on 2017-07-18 made an announcement on Facebook to friends & family to assume all posts are public, reactions/comments backed to my personal domain. Also added disclosure to bio/intro.

== Silo Examples ==
Silo examples of disclosures nearly always mention some form of cookie tracking (and hopefully why), as well as one or more of the following:
* Cookies Policy
* Terms of Service (TOS)
* Privacy Policy
(additional specific research for each of those may deserve its own page)

=== Facebook ===
(this section is a stub, feel free to expand!)

Upon loading a Facebook profile page (perhaps any FB page) in Germany (having already been logged beforehand in the US), Facebook shows a cookie disclosure statement above their normal top of page toolbar:

<blockquote>To help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies. By clicking or navigating the site, you agree to allow our collection of information on and off Facebook through cookies.

=== Twitter ===
(this section is a stub, feel free to expand!)

Upon visiting the Twitter homepage or a profile page (possibly all other pages to) in the Netherlands while being logged out, Twitter shows a cookie and data transfer disclosure statement in a floating alert box.

(and with Toolbar - note background based on profile page, since Twitter's disclosure is overlaid on top of the profile, instead of pushing it down)
[[File:2016-09-18-twitter-cookie-use.png]]

<blockquote>By using Twitterâ€™s services you agree to our [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514 Cookie Use] and [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20174632 Data Transfer] outside the EU.
