A '''<dfn>disclosure</dfn>''' is a bit of content, typically on a [[home page]], on an indie web site that proactively discloses some aspect about the site that the site owner wants the user to explicitly be aware of. E.g.

* cookie tracking
* analytics
* affiliations with organizations (sometimes on specific [[posts]] that are topically related to those organizations)
* services provided, such as webmentions
* privacy policy, as it involves the above
* contact information is anything in the disclosure is incorrect

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* Jeremy Zilar on his [http://silencematters.com/ silencematters.com] sidebar, has a Google Analytics disclosure and links to opt out and learn more: <blockquote>Note:<br/>I use Google Analytics to understand how people are using my website.<br/>Opt-out | Learn more</blockquote>

== Backfeed Examples ==
[[backfeed|Backfeed]], even from public silo profiles, may not be an obvious consequence by commenters/likers of [[POSSE]] copies. Thus it makes sense, especially for silo [[private account]]s and [[private post]]s by default, explicitly disclose on your silo profile that you are / may be backfeeding comments/likes etc. to your own site.

=== Kyle Mahan Instagram ===
