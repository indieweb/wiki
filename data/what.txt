== What is IndieWebCamp ==
'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp</dfn>''' is a 2-day creator camp and ongoing community (e.g. on [[IRC]]) focused on growing the independent web or "indieweb" for short.

== What is the indieweb ==
{{main|indieweb}}

The indieweb is about owning your domain and using it as your primary identity.
* You can have more than one such personal domain.
* You could use your own domain for purely a ''professional'' identity facet, preferring to keep anything personal off the internet/web. That's totally fine.

You might:
* Have an [[hCard]] on your home page which acts as your electronic contact card.
* Link to "other profiles" from your home page with [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me rel=me].
* Use your domain as your [[OpenID]] (by delegation or perhaps a plugin that implements OpenID)

Content hosting possibilities
* You own your own domain but use [[Tumblr]].com or WordPress.com or some other hosted content solution to publish content (like [[posts]]) on your site.
* You use a full-service web site hosting service and have them maintain a [[WordPress]] or other CMS install and databases for you.
* You use a [[web hosting]] service and maintain your own WordPress or other CMS [[project]] install, backup your content (files and/or databases) etc.

== What is a creator ==
{{main|creator}}
Being a <span id="builder">creator</span> means you do one or more of:
* '''code'''. create or contribute to indieweb open source projects
* '''design'''. create or contribute to indieweb designs, graphic, layout, adaptive or otherwise.
* '''ux'''. create wireframes or other indieweb user interface flows

To be an ''indieweb'' creator, you must be using the things you create (code, design, ux) on your personal site. We call that [[selfdogfooding]].

== What is a camp ==
'''<dfn>Camp</dfn>''', in the context of a IndieWebCamp, refers to the [[BarCamp]] structure that is used at IndieWebCamps, with the following modifications:
* '''[[Creators]] only''' (each of which may bring an [[apprentice]]).
* '''Day 1: Brainstorming''' / Inspiration / Ideas
** usual 3 [[tag]] BarCamp-style introducitons
** starts with demos of what people have ''already'' working on their ''personal'' website(s).
** 45-60 min sessions on brainstorming what to create / build next, exploring challenges
* '''Day 2: Creating''' / Hackday / DevDay / Demos
** 120-180 min hacking/coding sessions
** ~16:00 demos of what people got working ''during'' the camp
