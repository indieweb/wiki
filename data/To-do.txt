Next steps for IndieWebCamp and indie web efforts.

== IndieWebCamp 2014 ==
Help organize and volunteer for:
* [[2014/NYC|IndieWebCampNYC 2014]]
* [[2014|IndieWebCamp 2014]] in Portland

== Improve [[Getting Started]] ==
In progress of updating [[Getting Started]] steps to:
* simplify steps (create subpages if necessary for longer explanations)
* reduce steps to only those that are required and have direct benefits
** i.e. are direct steps toward achieving [[IndieMark]] levels in various areas.
** provide an explicit "Why?" quick and easily understandable explanation of the benefits, the motivating reasons for taking this step. What problems are solved? What new capabilities do you get by taking this step.
* re-order steps in order of ease of implementation / dependency 
* move nice-to-haves, or simpler side options, to other pages.

I've updated [[Getting_Started#Connect|Connect]] and [[Getting_Started#Personal_Domain|Personal Domain]] accordingly (including subsuming short domain as a "bonus" subpart of personal domain) so far and will work on subsequent Getting Started steps accordingly. However, if you want to help with these updates, please go for it and edit accordingly! - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:06, 7 May 2013 (PDT)

Currently working on:
* [[Getting_Started#Partial_Solutions|Partial Solutions]] - which needs a very heavy rewrite and likely moving of most (if not all) of its content to other pages, since partial solutions are a bit of a branch off/away-from real indieweb support.
* ...

== Improve [[Why]] Explanation ==
* create subsections on [[why]] for frustration, fear, death
* provide good photo/summary page links (e.g. lightboxes of screenshots) for all corp site failures on [[site-deaths]] and [[why]] pages.
* copy each "why" citation for a silo to a Criticisms or Downtime section for that silo

== Quoting Embedding Display ==
Quoting Embedding Display (QED) guidelines:
* Write IndieWeb versions of embedding/quoting display guidelines for when other sites display indie web posts/content
See: '''[[quoting]]''' for details and see [[reply-context]] for some thinking/progress.

== Tagboards ==
Create additional Tagboards (e.g. http://tagboard.com/indieweb ) for IndieWeb related things, and any tags used/mentioned by [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp] (or [https://twitter.com/indiewebcampuk @indiewebcampuk]) and link them to the respective wiki pages here.

== Process Criticism ==
* If/when you see IndieWeb critical (or silo apologist) articles, add to: [[challenges#Citations_to_process]]

* Go through [[challenges#Citations_to_process]] and analyze the articles, extracting new [[FAQ]]s and specific challenges for the IndieWeb to overcome.
