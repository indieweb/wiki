[[User:tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] uses [[Ferocity]] on tommorris.org with the following note creation interface since  2013-03-25 (or perhaps earlier)

* The circle-in-circle is for geolocation: clicking it on uses the browser geolocation API to set the location of the post.
* The tickbox for Twitter lets him decide whether to syndicate the post to Twitter or not.

==== and adactio photos ====
On 2014-07-05 he added the ability to attach a photo to a note, as a way to do simple [[photo]] posts (which [[POSSE]]d to both [[Twitter]] and [[Flickr]]

You can baerly see the UI with the addition of a "Choose File" HTML file input, in the second window on his laptop screen here in this photograph:

==== per silo POSSE toggles ====
He then subsequently ~2014-10-01 added the ability to selectively (per post) toggle POSSEing to Twitter and/or Flickr (both default on).

== Mobile ==
Mobile note creation is particularly challenging for various reasons:
* less reliable network (thus possible loss of user data if depending on JS / AJAX)
* smaller displays (less space to see what you're typing)
* touch keyboards (clumsier / less accurate than physical tactile keyboard)

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]], at the top of your profile/wall "timeline" presents a UI for creating a new post with three explicit post-type options:
* Status | Photo/Video | Life Event
With "Status" chosen by default, and the prompting text: "What's on your mind?"

[[File:Facebook profile create post 2015-09-20.png]]

This is a big simplification from their past create UIs that had various post types explicitly differentiated in the UI like [[checkin]], link/[[bookmark]], etc.

If you activate the text area (where the default text is), new options are provided below it:

[[File:Facebook profile create post options 2015-09-20.png]]

The icons represent (and show as tooltip text if you hover)
* "Add photos to your post"
* "Tag people in your post"
* "Add what you're doing or how you're feeling"
* "Add a location to your post" (auto-filled with a city name, and showing a close box to remove)
* "Set date and time of your post"
* Who should see this? Public, Friends, Only Me (default), Custom, school, company1, company2, ... companyN

Selecting "Life Event" expands the create box into a set of categories to choose from:
* Work & Education, Family & Relationships, Home & Living, Health & Wellness, Travel & Experience

If you now reselect "Status" - it activates the text field, and shows the same status options as noted above.
