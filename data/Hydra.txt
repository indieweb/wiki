'''<dfn>Hydra</dfn>''' either refers to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra mythological many headed creature], or a W3C Community Group that aims to standardize how a web API can advertise its operations and what types of objects it expects/returns, or references to how they are related, paraphrased "Cut off one hydra discussion, Two more shall take its place."[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/quotes?item=qt2140358][http://socialwg.indiewebcamp.com/irc/social/2015-03-03/line/1425408928150].

== Examples ==
No known real world examples of Hydra usage, certainly no [[selfdogfooding]].

== Criticism ==
=== WSDL Again ===
The summary goal "aims to standardize how a web API can advertise its operations and what types of objects it expects/returns" is essentially the same as [[WSDL]] a failed effort to do the same.

Unclear what about Hydra is different (enough) to cause it to succeed where WSDL failed.
