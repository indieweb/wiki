This page is to document '''learning resources''' that are useful to helping build your own website.

== why? ==

Web technology has gotten more complicated. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, back-end coding, web frameworks, more complex specifications and developer tools means that learning the "web stack" takes more time and effort than ever before. This has made running your own website harder, and thus the position of [[silo]] services more attractive.

== meta ==

Please make sure that all resources are up-to-date: HTML tutorials should describe only stuff that works on the web now using current-era HTML, JavaScript tutorials should refer to JavaScript as it ought to be written on the web today, not bad old DHTML-era stuff.
