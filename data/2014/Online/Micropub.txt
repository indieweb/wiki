notes from the micropub session:

ben.thatmustbe.me has an implementation of delete and update now:
* adds two OAuth scopes (edit and delete)
* undelete would fall under delete scope

Currently other actions besides create are specified by an "operation" field (though "create" is specified for completeness)
* operation=delete
* operation=edit
* operation=undelete
* operation=syndicate

currently ben has no way to remove a title (no current difference between handling a field empty vs a field not present)

after deleting a post, ben's logged-in view shows the post with "deleted"

silo examples of removing partial content:
* composing a tweet, attaching a photo, removing the photo before posting
*removing facebook preview from the post
* google+ removing a circle that a post is shared with

Different kinds of 
* updating: changing existing values
* updating: deleting existing values (removing tags, removing location)
* updating: adding new values (adding tags, or adding location) 
* delete: whole post
* undelete: whole post

how to handle add/remove from fields that have multiple values? (tags, syndication targets)

a micropub request to syndicate - not just an edit, since it's not idempotent
* action=syndicate?

how to create/edit ACL for a post in micropub?

querying micropub endpoint for the list of syndication targets

go to Quill, Quill prompts you to click a checkbox to say "use this as my default post interface"

other things to query for:
* list of categories you might want to add to a post, maybe for an autocomplete interface
* list of people you want to tag - (once someone implements [[people tagging]] of course
