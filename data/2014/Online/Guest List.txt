| Are you a '''[[Creator]]''' (create & share ''design, UI/UX, and/or code'')? Either: add yourself to the guest list by '''[[Special:UserLogin|Logging in]] with your own domain''', or '''Publish a post saying that you're coming with a link to [https://indiewebcamp.com/2014/Cambridge/Guest_List this RSVP page]''' and send a [[pingback]] to it.

| If you're in the process of setting up your personal site, or don’t have a personal site but want one, or want to create and contribute to the IndieWeb but don't know where to start, you’re still very welcome! Find a creator (either listed below, or ask on [[IRC]]) to team up with and ask them to add you as their apprentice. Then get your site setup with [[IndieAuth]] and edit your entry!
