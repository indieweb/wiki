'''<dfn>Possible events</dfn>''' are ideas or thoughts for indieweb [[events]] that are proposed or being considered and looking for feedback or co-organizers.

If you want an [[IndieWebCamp]] (or a [[Homebrew Website Club]] or something similar) in your city, pop it up on here so we can track interest in the community for having events elsewhere.
