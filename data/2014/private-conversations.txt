Private Discussions and Private Social Networks
(3pm at https://etherpad.mozilla.org/indiewebcamp )

* Early in the web, it was easy to have, e.g., a LiveJournal. As you develop a public persona, it becomes harder to post things which are unfinished
* Need a cloud-based place to put notes, etc
* Setting up private blogs, sites for small audiences

How do people feel about the security of posting private info on a web site?
* Amber: ok if its my own server; not ok on wordpress.org


After setting up Wordpress
* limit login attempts
* p2 theme.  boom, a social network!
* custom login.  customize what people can see without logging in
* more privacy options: set reading visibility to network users, or site admins only
* p2 likes: like posts
* simple local avatars: upload a picture, user profile, etc.
* p2 resolved posts: edited the plugin codes so that the choices are "flag new" and "flag read"
* peter's login redirect: send individual users to specific parts of a site (without having to do multisite)
* who's online: just what you'd expect from the name!  if you add it ot the sidebar, shows who's online whenever you log in
* chatroom: live chat.  can also add video plugins

can set up wordpress app from iphone to post to this site.  when i take notes, i do it through the wordpress app; they all get timestamped etc.  works offline, when my phone's in airplane mode it queues them up

you can tag things, install additional plugins to get deeper categorization

* what about search?  could set it up as a single multi-site
* notifications?  one of them i check it regularly, as frequently as facebook.  and if they need me to look at it right now, they'll text me.  "if i got a ping every single time somebody updates something here, i'd go insane".  there might be a plugin to set a custom post type or specific tag and you'll get notified on your site.  without any code at all you could use IfThisThenThat.   

A calendar would be really nice too, but it hasn't gotten that annoying yet.  Calendering sucks, but I don't want to share my Google calendar.

(lengthy discussion about multiple identities and pseudonymity)

interesting to think of places that embrace different kinds of temporality
* ephemerality
* meatspac.es: no usernames, you're represented by a 2-second moving gif, so you need to have an idea of who's there to make sense of it [your hash has a time-based component].  10-minute buffer.  anybody who's there *can* archive that, but it's not the cultural norms.  not "private" in that you'd feel comfortable discussing financials or overthrowing the state, but it's a very different feel.  it's a community norm to use your face.
