Ellen's 3+million retweet:

Kartik: If Aaron reposts Barnaby's post, he would keep a copy of the original on his repost. Now if Barnaby deletes the original should Aaron still keep a copy? What if the original post is copyrighted.

Tantek:
I want to implement reposts on my site so I keep a copy regardless, and also POSSE native retweet on Twitter.
Repost+comment: an emerging pattern on Twitter is to add a comment before retweeting as in "comment by retweeter" RT: @originalposter original post

Or using the recycle icon ♺ e.g.
* https://twitter.com/uogbuji/status/483004048988045312

=== Recycle Icon Aside ===
Aside:

Google can't find ♺

Nor Bing

But it's on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%BA

Unicode: U+267A ♺ recycling symbol for generic materials

=== Repost UI flow ===
Repost UI:
# You enter a URL to repost (or click a repost button)
# Your software asks for confirmation:
<pre>
"Repost this to your followers?"
(preview of your repost... )
           (Cancel) (Repost)</pre>

=== Repost presentation ===
UI sketches:
==== Reposting a tweet or post with POSSE tweet ====
Reposting a tweet, retweet, or indie post (repost) with POSSE tweet. Whiteboard:<br/> [[File:2014-179-iwc-nyc-repost-tweet.jpg|640px]]
==== Reposting a post that lacks a POSSE tweet ====
Reposting an indie post WITHOUT a POSSE tweet - how do you POSSE to Twitter? Either you don't, or if you do:
<samp style="margin:1em 2em;display:block">♺ user.example.com: "--------..." user.example.com/permalink</samp> 

Details:
* "------" = up to 99 characters of the text of the indie post being reposted
* ... - regardless of truncation include original permalink at end of POSSE copy (instead of permalink to your repost)
