goal: as easy as (or easier than) [[WordPress]], or for people who don't host their own - as easy as signing up on Tumblr

works either as a single-user or multi-user site

can write plugins to add additional post types (like [[chicken]]s)


who are the competitors?  [[WordPress]], primarily; to a lesser extent tumblr ("a tumblr that you own"), hootsuite and buffer (from the syndication aspects)
