You probably want some way to mark these kinds of things (as well as things like replies), and classify different ways to group and treat them differently. E.g. steps, bikes, runs, pushups are all "exercise" things, and you might want to filter all of those out, or just style them differently, or put them in the sidebar or whatever.
