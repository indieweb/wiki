Join us in Cambridge, MA for the very first IndieWebCamp at MIT - one of many [[IndieWebCamps]].

<div class="p-description description">
Join us at MIT for '''two days''' of a BarCamp-style gathering of web creators building and sharing open web technologies to empower users to own their own identities & content, and advance the state of the indie web!

The IndieWeb movement is a global community that is building an open set of principles and methods that empower people to take back ownership of identity and data instead of relying on 3rd party websites. 

At IndieWebCamp you’ll learn about ways to empower yourself to own your data, create and publish content on your own site, and only optionally syndicate to third-party silos. Along the way you’ll get a solid grounding in the history and future of Microformats, domain ownership, IndieAuth, WebMention and more!
