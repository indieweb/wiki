Micropub is for roughly using an interface that you didn't build to post to your site.

IndieAuth is used for auth access.

Minimal Example
<pre>
POST /micropub HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXX

h=entry
&content=Hello+World
</pre>

<pre>curl https://example.com/micropub -d h=entry -d "content=Hello World" -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXX"</pre>

Your website becomes an OAuth 2 provider in the process.

Reference implementation: https://quill.p3k.io

In the <head> of: http://aaronparecki.com
Delegates auth endpoint to IndieAuth
<pre><link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth"></pre>
Delegates token endpoint:
<pre><link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.oauth.net/token"></pre>

<pre><link rel="micropub" href="https://aaronparecki.com/api/post"></pre>

Quill (Micropub posting app in this case) stores that auth token to post to aaronparecki.com each time.

Not going into details but they are here: http://indiewebcamp.com/auth-brainstorming

Why is it h=entry and not type=entry? Aaron says he didn't want to use something that might be a field in an entry. H is indicator of microformats stuff. "type" might conflict with a property of the object

You can use indieauth.com or build it yourself for the auth endpoint and token endpoint.

https://tokens.indieauth.com  documentation on using the token endpoint

To use, put this in your head:
<pre><link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token"></pre>

Does it hurt to set head tag and headers? No, but it does make consumers do more work to check two places. 

The header could be mangled or removed by intermediate servers in the pipe. It is also harder for a user to control what headers can used. IMO for IndieWeb <link> tag is better --Bear

Aaron agreed to change all the spec docs to only use <link> tags, not HTTP headers. Simpler.
This also follows the same discovery pattern that other parts of indieweb use. -bear

Shane has contacted the author of MarsEdit; supports blogging APIs, even weird tumblr API. About implementing micropub support for it.
The description of MarsEdit was one of the first instances of XMP-RPC in the wild for posting content to a blog site

Shane and Jessica are building adapters between different APIs and micro pub api. Look at this neat chart <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4361/3127372/193bb444-e7bd-11e3-9b7a-f9a62d93ba0f.png" width="720">

Aaron has an iOS app that speaks micropub https://github.com/aaronpk/PushupCounter-iOS
as an h-entry that has an p-count property.

Need new scope for micro pub comments? 

Tokens can be associated with ACL group/scope - the token just identifies who is making the change and it's up to the app to decide if that user+action is allowed --bear
