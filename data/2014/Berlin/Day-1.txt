=== What you currently use / pain points ===

* Brennan: Social Igniter posting to Twitter, App.net, <del>Facebook,</del> IRC, email
* Jan: mostly Email, Github, IRC, ownCloud. Some Textsecure/SMS, Twitter, Meetup.com
* Malte: mainly Email, IRC, Diaspora
* Joe: Medium
* Garret: mostly Github, IRC. Facebook with friends, some Foursquare
* Diego: mostly Facebook and Twitter, email, Github
* Joachim: problem that most networks are very quantitative than qualitative. Working on Jolocom
* Christian: removed entries from every social network 2 years ago. Problem: getting judged by others on posts and superficial aspects. Their inability to present diversity in a character. Inability to - at least easily - push only relevant info to the relevant people (groups are not sufficient) Also working on Jolocom
* Jon : all of them. federation and transclusion missing everywhere

Of the current "silos" what do you use?

* Facebook DR, BN, GA, JL, JR
* Twitter DR, JC, BN, GA, JL, JR
* Github: JC, BN, GA, DR, JR
* Tumblr
* Instagram



=== What you would want (ideally) ===

What is your ideal publishing platform for a more open, decentralized, free, and IndieWeb in one sentence

* bnvk: a way to collaboratively organize events & calendars using IW protocols
* jancborchardt: a simple unified cross-platform messaging tool
* almereyda: flow charts of POSSE and PESOS and Bridgy and Webmention
** and IndieAuth / omniauth / WebID integration for four-point-five linkedopendata stars : https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth/issues/61
* DR: Promote POSSE and give people tools to became owners of their own identity.
* AS: a tool that properly reads my mind
* Joachim: More qualitative networks. Everyone could have their own mini-platform. Try to prevent overflow of information
* Christian: Less noise, not cluttering people’s attention. Something which is personally tailored



=== What can you do? ===

* Start publishing from it
** Purchase a domain name
** Purchase hosting
** Use your own hardware + something like PageKite (http://pagekite.net)
** alternative : https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok
* http://readwrite.com/2014/06/27/raspberry-pi-web-server-website-hosting#awesm=~oItCpp8SXyZb76
* Engage / encourage your community (software) provider Diaspora, Discourse, etc... to implement IW support
** (Jon) From my experiences, it is very hard to convince regular users to use interfaces they don't know yet, are not used to. A handbook, helpful advice or arguments would be highly appreciated.



=== Ideas for platforms & tools**

* Self hosted "box" solutions
** Indie Box http://indieboxproject.org/blog/
** ArkOS https://arkos.io
** Cozy https://www.cozycloud.cc
** ownCloud https://owncloud.org
* Indie App Store** **http://indiewebcamp.com/store
* Better authentication with PGP keys
** Kirby Auth App http://indiewebcamp.com/kirby-login-app
** Indie Auth PGP signin
* Integration with "other" tech tools & apps
** Mailpile - leveraging IndieWeb contacts and exposing email threads for public discourse
*** +1 for exposing email threads, which would basically render e-mail the original decentralized network
* "The Poster"
** Posting to multiple platforms while retaining the metadata they belong together.
* "The Reader"
** Postings from different platforms that conform to the same posting action are grouped together.



== Funding models ==

* Crowdfunding
** Mailpile raised $170,000 https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mailpile-taking-e-mail-back
* Company supporting the project
** ownCloud has a company providing support and additional business features https://owncloud.com
** support and added company features is a classic open source business model, see Red Hat, Canonical, …
* Getting a grant
** NLnet (Unhosted & remoteStorage was funded by them)
** Pagekite got a grant from the Icelandic government https://pagekite.net
** Knight Foundation
* Gittip, Flattr
