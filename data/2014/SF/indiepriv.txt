== Participants ==
* Paul Oppenheim http://pauloppenheim.com - no idea how this works, want info!
* ...

== Notes ==

=== P3K Private Messaging ===
* if you hit an url, get HTTP 401, indicating auth required
* http://aaronparecki.com/ - you can sign in on homepage, doesn't do anything different unless you have been authed for the item
* bear: should not issue 401, should issue 404 so that you don't disclose information to potential attackers
* bear: should have logging of access for auditing
* Reply is just a webmention, but server would need to auth to your server; act on your behalf
* Demo: adds pauloppenheim.com to a private post

=== Other Solutions ===

* PGP: exchange of messages (Sandeep Shetty & Aaron)
* Johannes: edge case: don't move the data, one server, family usecase
* Identity - parents may control child access, but now more often still sep ident
* Johannes: show "read" status? what if my machine reads it?
* iMessage - difference between sent to device and read by a human
* @gasull: bitmessage

=== talking ===

* Server to server - Johannes: ideal

=== Use Cases ===
* There are lots of solutions for sending text and photos right now (SMS, iMessage, Google Hangouts, Instagram DMs, etc)
* This gets more interesting when talking about sharing other content types, such as a live map
* Your bank statement is available, log in to view it
* Your lab results are in, log in to view
* Aggregate credit card statements to budget on a category across multiple accounts
