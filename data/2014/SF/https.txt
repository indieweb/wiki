Let's not turn this into a discussion about the architecture of SSL signing being broken...
* Free SSL certs from startssl.com
* startssl provides free wildcard certs with extra identity verification
* Namecheap provides cheap SSL certs ($5-$7/yr)
* http://www.ssls.com/
* http://indiewebcamp.com/https
* https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

Issues with SNI
* Some client libraries in some programming languages don't have support yet

SPDY - huge performance improvements

HTTP 2.0 won't put SSL requirements in the spec, but Mozilla and Google will both require SSL for SPDY. (http://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/01/04/strengthening_http_a_personal_view)

Tantek asks: is there a recommendation for something I can do to make https not suck when they visit my site?

Will: I'm ok saying Windows XP computers can't access my site. For an eCommerce site I would not say that.

SSL in indiemark?
* Level 1 - "don't do the wrong thing"
** Why? Don't provide a bad user experience 
** Example: https://waterpigs.co.uk/
* Level 2 - support it for your admin pages with a self-signed cert
** Why? Security, otherwise anyone can hack your CMS and post stuff as you. (e.g. firesheep) 
** Example: https://dunlaps.net/darius/wp-login.php
** How to make Wordpress use SSL: http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Over_SSL
** Note: If you actually get a real SSL cert and serve your admin interface from the same domain, you are actually in Level 3.
* Level 3 - provide your front-end over both https and http with a cert from a trusted CA
** Why? 
** Example: https://aaronparecki.com/ https://pauloppenheim.com/
* Level 4 - serve everything over https and send redirects from http -> https
** Example: https://snarfed.org/ (via HSTS header) https://willnorris.com/ (via 301 redirect)
* Level 5 - use correct ciphers, etc (see https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
** Example: https://willnorris.com/ (https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=willnorris.com)

Why?
* Tim Bray posted about serving his site via https (https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/02/HTTPS)
** "This blog isn’t terribly controversial. But if only the “controversial” stuff is private, then privacy is itself suspicious. Thus, privacy should be on by default."
** "Because I can; it’s the one small part of the Internet that I do have complete control of." (https://willnorris.com/2012/12/all-https-all-the-time)
* If you received a comment via an https website you can be more certain it's actually sent from the person
* Performance gains from using SPDY (https://thethemefoundry.com/blog/why-we-dont-use-a-cdn-spdy-ssl/)
