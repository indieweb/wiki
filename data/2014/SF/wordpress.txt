== Notes ==
Reference: [[WordPress]]

=== Be a good indieweb citizen ===
==== Support microformats ====
If you like your current theme and want to stick with it, use:
* Plugin: WordPress-uf2

Or if you're ok with switching to a new theme:
* SemPress - good microformatted theme - it's a whole theme

=== Itches ===
General consensus from Scott and Dan that getting Twitter feedback on to your own site is strongly desired.

Darius - Want flexibility of using different systems, but have everything then centered back in my own site. 

==== Bridgy with manual POSSE to Twitter ====
Scott: I want to write blog posts on my own site, then manually do a tweet that links to my blog post, then get feedback to that tweet automatically shown on my blog post.

Desired user-flow:
1. Publish a blog post on my indieweb site
2. Write a tweet manually that links to that post
3. Have favorites/retweets/@-replies to that tweet automatically show up on my blog post

Jetpack supports auto-POSSE to Twitter, Facebook and Google+

Also, some of the community are developing The indieWeb version of Jetpack.

==== Automatic Tweeting of Blog Posts ====
Desired user-flow:
1. Publish a blog post on my indieweb site
2. Have a tweet automatically happen that links to that blog post 

Example:
* https://twitter.com/dangillmor/status/442114320885743617
* Using WordPress JetPack Plugin and "Publicize" module, and turned on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+ (apparently through a bizdev deal between wp.com and Google!)

==== Have replies to tweets of a post show up on post ====
Desired user-flow:
1. Someone else @-replies one of my tweets that links to my blog post
2. A comment automatically show up on that blog post of that @-reply

Using WordPress "IndieWeb" plugin.
