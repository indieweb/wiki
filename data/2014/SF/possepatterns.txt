== Notes ==
Scott gave Barnaby a hard time about his tweets about a year ago because they were nearly unreadable when truncated. But recently they've improved.

How do we document best/worst practices for POSSE so that we can all POSSE better?

Bad examples seen in the wild on Twitter
* A sentence like "What really bothers me is ..."
* In general you put something on Twitter that is meaningless by itself
* Permashortlinks in tweets
* Permashortcitations make no sense to Scott
** looks like a broken link
** less bad than links to same content with no benefits
** perhaps a transition - until your own posts have more content than POSSE version, e.g. indieweb comments and [[Bridgy]] based favorites/retweets/comments from several silos.

Good practices:
* POSSE tweet preview UI
** see what you're going to tweet, how your friends will see it on the silo
** provides opportunity to craft your note so that it POSSEs ok to Twitter
* POSSE tweet with a photo gets more engagement

Why:
* We want to avoid the noisy/crappy look of Pingback
* We want to avoid having it look like just an auto-post
** e.g. https://twitter.com/jeffreyrbunch/status/377009306085773314
