Pushup iOS app, just communicates to a domain via IndieAuth login
(Unsure what Apple will think of login if submitted to App Store)
http://ownyourgram.com - server side version

Another example - Reporter by Feltron
Stores locally, can only get data out via email of a JSON dump, and DropBox

discussion of [[quantified self|Quantified Self]] devices,  cloud service model
alternative, mentioned earlier: Philips Hue. Base station is a web server, no cloud service (aside from IP discovery)

Reducing the cost of innovation. 

Don't need to compete on the entire category, can instead compete on just the feature. 

Paul - "Imagine getting a DM on twitter without having a twitter account." I just did that. Aaron sent me a private message on his own site, I was able to view it even though I don't have a blog, and have no ability to use my site to create a private post. I was able to participate in this without needing to have the ability to post. I didn't even need a data store, I just used Aaron's.

I have a static page on my domain, and IndieAuth means I can be part of a conversation without code

Bear: What you are describing is the same thing that happened when computers first came out, and came with BASIC. Nobody felt they shouldn't write programs.
