Tantek: don't market the plumbing

caseorganic: what is the value of indie auth?

Scott Rosenberg: integrirty and privacy of personal data, control of content you create

Dan Gillmore: we enjoy Twitter, we don't want to completely give up the fun and usefulness of silos. is there a fun and useful way of having both?

Anselm: what's the audience?

Dan Gillmore: we like creating things on the web, we're able to launch cpanel and click a button an do updates in wordpress. we're 

caseorganic: I give you POSSE and brid.gy. are you happy?

Dan Gillmore: I'm ecstatic!

caseorganic: comics are more likely to engage people, they will be more likely to read it. it is more prominent than a blog post.

caseorganic: we can build it and present it on my site

Anselm: what are the issues? what problems are we describing to people?

Kevin Marks: "are you tired of facebook changing things on you?" "do you remember that time the things you made disappeared from the internet?"

Scott Roesenberg: there are a whole 

caseorganic: there are a lot of people waiting for an option to get back to doing what they were doing long ago

Scott Jensen: it's not about having a bunch of close people in your audience in our network, you already have an audience and they will still come

caseorganic: brid.gy allows you to bring everybody with you

Scott Jensen: it's not all or nothing

Dan Gillmore: we're not rejecting the good things they provide, we're rejecting the lack of control

Scott Jensen: I can still play nice with all my friends on facebook

Anselm: this reminds of how why the lucky stiff would present things with comics

caseorganic: the Google Chrome comic was really great, but it didn't write to my brain as much as why the lucky stiff

first part: POSSE, put stuff on your site and guarantee it's there, and get it on other sites as well
second part: then, use brid.gy to allow interactions from content posted to those sites appears back on your site

Anselm: there is content you can't share on facebook, or it isn't easily shared well. how do you share an art project?

caseorganic: I post something on my site, you can respond to that post on your site

Dan Gillmore: community + freedom

Scott Jensen: "we're working above facebook, twitter, whatever", or working "with", or "alongside"

Kevin: city vs suburb, in a suburb there is one way in and one way out on a road, in a city roads have many crossroads

Anselm: you can't link to things you post on facebook. some people might get some content, some other people might not get it. it may or may not persist.
