=== Discussion ===
Big divide in the original readers
* is it an inbox where you have to read every item
* or more like a stream that lets you dip in and out
* a hybrid

What do we want an Indie reader to do?

* read feeds - rss/atom, h-feed, twitter/fb/silos
* inbox/stream
* actions: share/reply/repost/upvote/fave/bookmark/rsvp
* works on a phone
* hide/block/mark as spam
* mark as read
* grouping (shane posted this photo on x, y, z rather than as separate items)
* volume control per feed - filters
* mailbox rules
* full content in the reader
