== Notes ==
Discussion comparing different ways to use and/or build CMSes.

=== Roll your own? ===

* Hard!
* Requires maintenance
* often happens because current tools don't do what you want
* Customization
* Learn stuff?
* Ops Overhead

From group, six people had rolled their own, a few ruby and PHP, mentions of C#, Node, Python and Go.

==== Data Storage ====

* Databases
** Each system uses their own format
** You have to write Exporter / Importer
** "Bro, do you even backup?"

* HTML
** Much harder to lose / corrupt
** Viewable in the browser

=== Off the shelf ===

* Lock in?
* Easy mode
* Tested
* possibly crufty

* Django CMS (Python)
