Day 2 of IndieWebCamp is our hack, create, design, and build day.

== General Advice ==

# Still not sure what to hack on? '''Checkout [[IndieMark]]''' for some next steps for your site.
# Find '''one really simple thing''' to add to your site before lunch, one more challenging thing after lunch.
# '''Ask for help''' if you're stuck at all - you are short on time, but surrounded by high-bandwidth expertise. Ask on [[IRC]], ask your neighbors, ask an organizer.
# '''Help someone''' get unstuck. Listen and if you hear a question about something you know something about, take a few minutes to help someone or direct them to a resource on the wiki.

== Hack Sessions ==

Hack Session Proposals 
# write down on a sticky note:
#* '''what''' you're going to work on
#* your '''name'''
#* '''hashtag'''
# Announce what you're doing
#* pick an '''area''' / room / space
#* '''before/after lunch'''
#* and put your sticky up '''on the grid'''

'''Join forces''' with others working on similar things.
