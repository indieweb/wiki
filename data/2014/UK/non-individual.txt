Rel="us" so multiple users can claim the same domain

login with an official role


Talk of more advanced software solutions like having one user vet another users posts before going live.

In order to claim to be part of a domain the domain should have a list of all authors authorized to login as that domain.  Many rel=me links.  though I would suggest some other method like rel=member to prevent any cross user bleed.

Much of this discussion is devolving in to talk of private messaging now.  This is an interesting use-case though.  I want to send a message to "someone in accounting"  so anyone in that group should have private access to that message.

A good example is the support line for a company.  I want to send a message to support.  Who should be responding? Individual or should it come from a support account?
