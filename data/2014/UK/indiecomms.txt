CIP - can redirect home phone to mobile, etc

telephony - not changed much since 1876! Mechanical phone exchange 
numbers, dialling, switching

comms - hangouts, skyper, viber, whatsapp, facetime, 

whatsapp - uses phone number...

forget phone number - use URL and build it on the web!!

Closed ecosystem... can only facetime if have facetime account... can only skype with skype account

Social identity - this is how you contact me

Web RTC - protocol can carry anything

peer to peer
goes between two browsers 

data channels
audio/video real time 

Real time text

Google hangouts uses web rtc but it is still closed

Moving real time session data between people

Mozilla - still need account on the system

voice codec if sending voice... streaming

Phono:
Calling in interface - browser to browser 
  
Ben Roberts thatmustbeme/contact

You could choose the way that you want to be contacted, stops you getting called in the middle of the night

Twitter dm, Skype, IRC relies of buddy list... approving that person
Lot of comms we do if we don't know that person... restaurant 

Phone numbers - some people closely guard them, hard to stop people contacting you if they do have your number. Web can gate who contacts you.

Could give services URL.

Web RTC on front end
CIP on backend

NAT:

Stun box... allows machines to discover own ip address

Turn - more restrictive NAT


Many aspects to doing end-to-end indie communications

WebRTC is just plumbing.

Scenario:
1. pick up a computer with a browser that supports WebRTC
2. go to my site
3. start a call to me


Using IndieAuth -> domain - > intersection of contact preferences

* A signs into B's website with IndieAuth
* B's website shows more methods of contact (easy)
* B's website checks A's website for a rel=contact to a e.g. "/contact.html" page
* B's website parses the h-card from that page and checks all the "url" properties
* B's website does an intersection of the schemes of those URL properties and those on B's site
* B shows methods of contact that *both* B and A have.
** optionally it can show other methods of contact that A does not have, but just greys them out, so that A knows they could go install/setup those.


Contextual enhancements for the contacter, e.g. show contextual information on contacts page or even home page like:
* time where the person is (via automatic checking of Foursquare to imply timezone)
* at the movies - do not contact (again via Foursquare)

2014-03-07 Personal Site Focussed Mobile Comms UX
(and payment)

#indiecomms

Participating:
* Tantek Ã‡elik (tantek.com)


== Background ==
* http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience
* http://indiewebcamp.com/Falcon#mobile_home_template_header_icons_folders

== Notes ==

* grid of communication apps on mobile device - high cognitive load - how do I communicate with this person?
* open 
comm app - you have a new message! BETTER GO CHECK IT!
* Start with people - click to open a window to compose a message to them
* UI design on indiewebcamp wiki - in public domain. If you can implement it first, great!
* iOS - Face icon, several comm methods in subfolders next to it
* List of communication methods would change depending on whether tantek is asleep, or depending onthe timezone
* Potential issue: Everyone who implements a list of contact methods on their site will do it differently, so there won't be a standard at-a-glance way to identify this. But everybody wants to be able to choose how to present it on their site.
* Possible solution is different reader interfaces that can parse the raw microformats data 
* If we get the markup right, we can create an awesome stylesheet that everyone can share so people who are not good at CSS can use it and make it look nice
* It has to look better and have a better experience than the native grid of comm apps on the mobile device (otherwise it just looks like "some crappy web thing")
* Discussion: preference of contact method; Travis wonders why not just have one interface to send to preferred?
* Good problem to have; at least the person has the ability to specify their communication preference in order. Silos have taken a stab at this, but example of Windows people-centric client-only UI getting this wrong - sorted by your pref of comms, not your friend
* Does this mean all contact methods are public? No, can choose to publish only certain channels publicly (like AIM), and if you IndieAuth in, then new channels appear. Maybe grey them out instead of hiding them so people know there are more things that will show up if they log in.
* much discussion about specifics, webrtc
* u-impp - rfc4770 - only supports 8 methods? http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4770
* IRC URI: irc://myserver/kilroy,isnick?msg=are%20you%20here%3F

== Prototypes ==
* In-progress userstyle for standard rendering of communication methods in an h-card: https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/userscripts/lets_talk.user.css
Need to convert it (part or whole) to JS, probably with http://microformatshiv.com/
* TODO: find URI schemes for all the apps (sms:, etc)
* snarfed: many of these are posted, offers to find them

* irc://irc.freenode.net/tantek,isnick
** Colloquy doesn't support ",isnick" and thus creates a channel "tantek" instead
*** Need to file a bug against Colloquy
** 
** Snak doesn't support this, tries to join #tantek and #isnick
