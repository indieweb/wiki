CIP - can redirect home phone to mobile, etc

telephony - not changed much since 1876! Mechanical phone exchange 
numbers, dialling, switching

comms - hangouts, skyper, viber, whatsapp, facetime, 

whatsapp - uses phone number...

forget phone number - use URL and build it on the web!!

Closed ecosystem... can only facetime if have facetime account... can only skype with skype account

Social identity - this is how you contact me

Web RTC - protocol can carry anything

peer to peer
goes between two browsers 

data channels
audio/video real time 

Real time text

Google hangouts uses web rtc but it is still closed

Moving real time session data between people

Mozilla - still need account on the system

voice codec if sending voice... streaming

Phono:
Calling in interface - browser to browser 
  
Ben Roberts thatmustbeme/contact

You could choose the way that you want to be contacted, stops you getting called in the middle of the night

Twitter dm, Skype, IRC relies of buddy list... approving that person
Lot of comms we do if we don't know that person... restaurant 

Phone numbers - some people closely guard them, hard to stop people contacting you if they do have your number. Web can gate who contacts you.

Could give services URL.

Web RTC on front end
CIP on backend

NAT:

Stun box... allows machines to discover own ip address

Turn - more restrictive NAT


Many aspects to doing end-to-end indie communications

WebRTC is just plumbing.

Scenario:
1. pick up a computer with a browser that supports WebRTC
2. go to my site
3. start a call to me


Using IndieAuth -> domain - > intersection of contact preferences

* A signs into B's website with IndieAuth
* B's website shows more methods of contact (easy)
* B's website checks A's website for a rel=contact to a e.g. "/contact.html" page
* B's website parses the h-card from that page and checks all the "url" properties
* B's website does an intersection of the schemes of those URL properties and those on B's site
* B shows methods of contact that *both* B and A have.
** optionally it can show other methods of contact that A does not have, but just greys them out, so that A knows they could go install/setup those.


Contextual enhancements for the contacter, e.g. show contextual information on contacts page or even home page like:
* time where the person is (via automatic checking of Foursquare to imply timezone)
* at the movies - do not contact (again via Foursquare)
