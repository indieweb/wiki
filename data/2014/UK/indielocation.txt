Glenn: wants to be able to do last-checkin discovery for people, enabling maps of where people were last seen.

Barnaby: could be implemented easily using latest h-entry with location on homepage + location algorithm http://indiewebcamp.com/location#How_to_determine_the_location_of_a_microformat

adactio’s been storing his location on blog posts for two years, not sure what to do with it.

Tom Morris: thinking of storing location automatically, making location checkbox toggle public display rather than collection.

Glenn: if we’re all posting reasonable checkins we can start to build aggregation tools enabling foursquare-like use cases

Tom: handling OSM data is tricky because there’s so much of it and you want it all to hand at once to get useful results.

Tom: fireagle used to have location accuracy as an oauth option — you could even choose to share country-level data only, which still has legitimate uses.

Glenn: we’ve all been publishing location data assuming that it’s accurate, but that’s not the case, which starts to really matter once you consume the data. The HTML5 geo API gives us accuracy in metres, we need to publish this in microformats.

Possibility of using h-feed + h-entry + location + rel next/prev to crawl feeds and build up a history of people’s location.
