Glenn jones talking about transmat


it powers http://glennjones.net/ (not the articles section yet but everything else)

https://transmat.io/ "Our Mac App stores all your content in HTML. This format is both readable offline and has true longevity. The HTML contains a full copy of all your data and can be used as a backup"  nice!

will likely use the wordpress model.  hosted service and open source version


core event and plugin structure..  Node events i presume?   

would be easy to add an ftp plugin

webmentions arrive at glen jones.net and then are forwarded to transmat to be handled.   still in prototype mode, but will be supported on all transmat sites.

talking about all the different little parts of transmat that are available at http://tools.transmat.io/
(the microformat parser is top notch in node!)
- autolinker
- markdown processor
- microformats parser
- webmention endpoint/forwarding/processing

"its like elastic search with a UI/UX for independent publishing"
