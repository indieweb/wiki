webactions hack session

switching from <action> to <indie-action> per web components convention.

some updates to indiewebcamp.com/webactions

Twitter is inconsistent about in-stream webaction UI.
semi-consistent:
* left aligned - underneath the text (datetime is on same line as author icon name at top)
* grey icons only - no text label (some views have counts of faves, retweets)
* favorite, retweet, repost
So will likely imitate that.

2-3 specific webactions at most
any more, use a (...) "more" menu/popup for more choices, e.g.:
* email post
* embed post
* mute author
* block or report author

in-stream web actions

https://indiewebcamp.com/webactions

buttons like:
Like  - Repost - Reply 

under each post
- on a permalink
e.g. http://tantek.com/2014/248/t2/personal-site-demos-indiewebcamp-selfdogfood
- in stream
e.g. http://adactio.com

Tantek demos the fallback webaction to like -> favorite on Twitter
e.g. on http://tantek.com/2014/248/t2/personal-site-demos-indiewebcamp-selfdogfood

Barnaby demos how it works for him with the Webaction Hero Toolkit Browser Add-on with a Reply button. 

on news.indiewebcamp.com , because the <action> tag uses the "inline" attribute, it puts in an iframe for barnaby to write a comment.

part of the reason to add webactions to posts inline is that silos are doing and have taught users to do it.

Silo Examples:
* Twitter - appears to be moving to showing tweet actions left-aligned underneath each tweet
* Facebook - Like/Comment

see also wiki pages
* https://indiewebcamp.com/like (includes "heart" and +1 usage - endorsement)
* https://indiewebcamp.com/favorite (often used as time-shifting, saving)


Facebook has a read it later / save feature as well: http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/facebook-save-feature/


Appears that silos have been converging on putting actions on the left side, underneath a post.
Twitter, Instagram, Facebook

Another possibility:
Options:
Twitter: Favorite, Retweet, Reply
Facebook: _________
