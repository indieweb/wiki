Security
IndieWebCamp UK 2014

* Let’s at least not get embarrassingly hacked
* For HTTPS: need a cert signed by a commonly-trusted authority
** StartSSL are free
** Globalsign will give out free wildcard certs to open source projects
* Which certificate?
** Basic SSL cert will cover bare domain and www. (tom: http://no-www.org/ because who wants to type www all the time)
** Generate at least 2048 bit key
** Don’t get a SHA1 cert, it’s being phased — get a SHA2

Process:
* you generate a key (.key file) — this never leaves your server
* you generate a certificate signing request (.csr)
* you send the CSR to the authority (NOT the .key)
* you get a certificate (either .crt or .pem) which is signed by the authority

Jeremy: this stuff isn’t easy, esp. for people who’ve just learnt HTML+CSS — why isn’t there a GUI where you can press a button and it’s done?
Tim: With StartSSL there’s no need to use the CLI, you can do it all in the browser [ed: how? need docs!]

First: get HTTPS working
Then, make sure all that effort wasn’t wasted:
* redirect HTTP -> HTTPS
** some web application frameworks give you hooks to ensure URLs are protected
* add HSTS header
* make sure your cookies are secure (only served over HTTPS) and HTTP-only (XSS attacks can’t access them via JS)
* avoid mixed content warning

Intermediate certificates: when a root authority gives someone else the ability to sign, and they sign you, you need to provide both your cert and any intermediate certs, concatenated in the same file [in what order?]
