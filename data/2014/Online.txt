Join us for the very first IndieWebCamp Online. <dfn>IndiewebCamp Online</dfn> is a one-day [[IndieWebCamps|IndieWebCamp]] conducted entirely online without a physical venue. 

<div class="p-description description">
Join us digitally for a day of a BarCamp-style gathering of web creators building and sharing open web technologies to empower users to own their own identities & content, and advance the state of the indie web!

The IndieWeb movement is a global community that is building an open set of principles and methods that empower people to take back ownership of identity and data instead of relying on 3rd party websites. 

At IndieWebCamp you’ll learn about ways to empower yourself to own your data, create and publish content on your own site, and only optionally syndicate to third-party silos. Along the way you’ll get a solid grounding in the history and future of Microformats, domain ownership, IndieAuth, WebMention and more!

== Brainstorming ==

How does an online Indiewebcamp work?  We'll be looking to find out. Like every other part of Indiewebcamp, we will take this and iterate on it.

=== Duration ===

A traditional IndieWebCamp is two days. But, being as the group does not have to gather in the same physical location, this opens the door to ask if the frequency of IndieWebCamps could be increased if there were also one-day events. We have thus scheduled this as a one-day event.

=== Format ===

An IndieWebCamp consists of BarCamp style discussions and a Hack Day. Are there variations of this or alternate formats?

For example, a Hack Day where we break up into groups of people who want to work on implementing the same/similar features...

The tentative format will be a half-day of discussion and a half-hack-day. This may be split up due to timezones.

I would suggest we try to make as much use of the multi-room abilities of video chats, especially since we can then record them all.  Every hack group who wants to have their own discussions can easily be a room.  The smaller the chat rooms the less noise that will happen the more people can focus on their particular topic.

There is no limit to the number of rooms but we should probably force a limit just to make sure that there are not too many sessions going at any one time.  It may be that for this first event we actually only have 1 track the entire time, but I'm hoping to have 2.

=== Timezones === 

Having an online event means one has to factor in the timezones of the various attendees. Common timezones of physical IWCs have been European/UK, Pacific, and Eastern times.

One option is to adopt a time that works for the majority of participants, which requires some advance notice, and possibly may alter attendance.

An alternate one is to split the day into smaller pieces to accommodate.

=== Technology ===

Previous IWCs have used Talky.io. However, this is a group chat tool, and not necessarily tuned for a presentation format. It may be more ideal to use Hangouts On Air. Hangouts limits the number of Hangout participants while allowing for live streaming for observers.

Would suggest a 'dry run' in advance, so that the coordinators can assist others in getting things working.

I agree, dry run sounds like a good plan.  I think Hangouts is the way to go for this, specifically so recording of all videos is done without any trouble.  it also gives private chat rooms to the individual rooms, but these are not logged (i believe) so organizers need to take care to copy down any information they would like to persist.
