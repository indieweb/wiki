=== Let's build an [[2014/IndieWeb Aggregator|IndieWeb Aggregator]] ===
'''Proposed by: [[werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]]''' 

Writing is only half the story. Let's get the ball rolling on an ecosystem of awesome indieweb readers across platforms.

=== [[2014/Private Posts|Private Posts]] ===
'''Proposed by: [[werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]]''' 

I want to be able to share privately from my own site to my friends (and my company). So do my friends - they've told me so. Oh, and btw, Pew found that 84% of Internet users are concerned about privacy. How can we start thinking about this?

=== [[2014/Streaming Media|Streaming media]] on your own site ===
'''Proposed by: [[werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]]''' 

It's not just about text. I don't want to use YouTube to host video - I want all my content in one place. Those of us who are doing this, how are we doing it? Can we make it better / usable for people who don't own their own full-on servers? Which services do we feel comfortable leveraging?

=== [[2014/Intro to IndieAuth|Intro to IndieAuth]] ===
'''Proposed by: {{aaronpk}}'''

What is IndieAuth, how is it different from indieauth.com, how you can build your own IndieAuth server, etc. This will cover all the work being documented at the [[:Category:IndieAuth|IndieAuth category]] on the wiki.

=== [[2014/Micropub|Micropub]] ===
Requested by: {{gRegor}}<br>
'''Led by: {{aaronpk}}'''

This will be a general overview of [[Micropub]]. What is it? Why do we need it? How do I implement it?

=== [[2014/Event Discovery|Event Discovery]] ===
'''Requested by: {{aaronpk}}'''

What is the best way to find out about indiewebcamp events? or events from other communities? Facebook events are too noisy, Tweets are too hard to miss, people don't want to check http://indiewebcamp.com/events all the time. What would an ideal user experience look like for discovering these events you're interested in?

=== [[2014/Design Elements|Design Elements of an IndieWeb Site]] ===
'''Requested by: {{kylewm}}'''

I try to design a site that is elegantly minimalist, but it always comes out feeling cluttered, monochrome, and boring! How does one emphasize the important elements on a page without ditching all the indieweb accouterments like reply-contexts. I'd be interested in nuts and bolts talk about fonts, colors, margins, icons, rounded borders, and/or a more philosophical/holistic high-level discussion.

=== Security of Indieweb Sites ===
'''Requested by: [[User:Kartikprabhu.com|Kartik Prabhu]]'''

With recent attacks on Twitter accounts (like @n and @j) and also the attack on codespaces.com, how can we make the indieweb more secure? If an army of well-trained engineers can not seem to do it, how do we as individuals accomplish that level of security?

=== Indie-comments using trust-less micropub ===
'''Requested by: [[User:Kartikprabhu.com|Kartik Prabhu]]'''

How can we have indie-comment boxes, which not only post comments on a site, but also post it to the commenters site? Maybe an expanded discussion on [[micropub#Micropub_for_Comments|Micropub for comments]]
