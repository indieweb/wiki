The very first IndieWebCamp in New York City - one of many IndieWeb [[events]].

<div class="p-description description">
Own your data.

Rather than posting content on third-party silos of content, we should all own the content we're creating. Publish on your own domain, and syndicate out to silos.

Join us at The New York Times building in New York City for '''two days''' of a BarCamp-style gathering of web creators building and sharing open web technologies to empower users to own their own identities & content, and advance the state of the indie web.
