The opening IndieWebCamp [[2014]] session.

IndieWebCamp leaders will lead you through: 

# Announce: Welcome to the 4th annual IndieWebCamp!
# Show Squarespace parody video
# Tell brief history: 
#* frustration with silos/[[site-deaths]] (unreliability, loss of content, UX changes, lack of features etc.)
#* 2010 [[Federated Social Web Summit|frustrated social web summit]] 
#* too much talk/email, not enough action, so...
#* attendees {{aaronpk}} & {{tantek}} decided to focus on an "IndieWeb" instead, and
#* with Amber & Crystal organized the first IndieWebCamp in [[2011]]
# Show http://indiewebcamp.com/ home page and [[principles]]
# Note explicit decision to focus on
#* '''personal site''' "scratch your own itch" doers, doing, [[selfdogfood]]ing, demoing
# Overview of IndieWebCamp Two Days: 
#* day 1: intro/demos, lunch, brainstorming sessions, dinner
#* day 2: day two hack sessions, lunch, hack sessions, demos
# [[2014/demos|Demos]] of what works on your site today - note: '''must''' be a demo on your primary personal website (NOT: a secondary site, demo deployment, other corp/school/org site, random github library - this is a challenge to get your stuff working on your public personal site - if you won't put it on yours, why should anyone else on theirs?)
# Explanation of today (brainstorming sessions) vs tomorrow (hack sessions)
# Intro to how Barcamp sessions are scheduled (write THREE THINGS on a notecard: 1. session name, 2. your name, 3. session #hashtag - used for tagging and etherpad.mozilla.org/indieweb-hashtag)
# Session scheduling!
# Camp leaders call *start your sesssions* at start time
