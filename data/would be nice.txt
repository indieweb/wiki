{{stub}}

'''<dfn>would be nice</dfn>''' is an expression (as in, “It would be nice if …” or “X would be nice”) used to justify ideas for which no-one has come up with a concrete real-world use-case for, and is an [[antipattern]] due to being typically used for academic purist justifications as opposed to real-world evidence based justifications. 

If there are examples of real-world evidence and use-cases to justify something, those should be always be expressed instead of the expression “would be nice”.
