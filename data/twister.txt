'''<dfn>[http://twister.net.co/ Twister]</dfn>''' is a "fully [[decentralized]] [[P2P]] [[microblogging]] platform built from free software implementations of [[Bitcoin]] and [[BitTorrent]] protocols"[http://twister.net.co/].

Twister has a desktop client which can also serve as a localhost webserver you browse to and get a [[Twitter]]-like experience.

The main focus of the project is [[censorship]]-resistance [allegedly. No citation given on purpose. Read the source :p]. There's no way to delete anything. Your typos will live forever.

== Twisterio ==
[https://twisterio.com/ Twisterio.com] is a read only web gateway for public twists.

It's unclear who runs the service, so ''if you're looking for something ''specific'', best is to access it via [[Tor]] :)''
