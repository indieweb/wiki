{{stub}}

'''<dfn>microsyntax</dfn>''' refers to short text conventions for conveying specific semantic meaning, such as an "@" prefix indicating a (user)name, or "#" prefix indicating a [[hashtag]] (both conventions popularized by [[Twitter]]).

== Research ==
'''Please see previous work at microformats.org:'''

New research:
* (Y) - Used for the thumbs up emoticon on Skype, Facebook 
* <3 - ASCII heart, used as substitute for “love”

== Brainstorming ==
A place to brainstorm indieweb microsyntax especially for plaintext [[notes]], and POSSEing of specific types of [[posts]] to plaintext-like [[POSSE]] destinations (e.g. [[Twitter]]])

=== at-sign for in-reply-to URL ===
* <nowiki>@example.com/some-post => <a href="http://example.com/some-post" class="u-in-reply-to"></nowiki>
** We need pfefferle and acegiak to clarify their [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-06-21#t1371819076 use case]. Just adding links to the users domain in your post will send a webmention to the domain, so IMO it is unnecessary to prefix user domains with @ so I'm assuming they meant post urls. &mdash;[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]
*** The idea was to generate an easy mardownish way to generate semantic links, not really meant to display to any enduser - [[User:Notizblog.org|Matthias Pfefferle]]
** No one does this currently (any real world example?) - feels a bit forced. People already think of "@" as meaning "hey this person". - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:54, 21 June 2013 (PDT)
** -1 agreed, this example is forced and doesn’t reflect real world usage. @mentions succeeded because they were a paved cowpath, it defeats the object to try to repurpose them --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 16:07, 21 June 2013 (PDT)
** "we wanted a way to mark which one was the reply-to without needing to edit the html because we want the plugins to be accessible to non-technical wordpress users -  plus, adding the html manually would be tiresome, so we're trying to work out a way to make it quick and easy" -[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-06-22#t1371902255 acegiak]
** Seems OK to me but I've settled on <code><nowiki>re: http://example.com/some-post</nowiki></code> in my personal logs & recently on my site ([http://colintedford.com/2014/12/08.2120-kirby-kerberos/ e.g.1], [http://colintedford.com/2015/01/07.0407-month-year-archives-now-have-links-to-the-next-previous-time-periods-thanks-to-the-adjacent-archive-links-plugin/ e.g.2]; just using as minimal reply context for now as I'm pretty sure others do). I've been only using it at the start of an entry but I think you could safely use it anywhere. [[User:Colintedford.com|Colintedford.com]] 21:11, 7 January 2015 (PST)

=== heart for like ===
* <nowiki><3 example.com =><a href="http://example.com" class="u-like"></nowiki>

=== metrics and exercise ===
Various [[metrics]] could use emoji, i.e. when POSSEing to text-like destinations like [[Twitter]]
* 🌜Slept 8 hours
* 🚲 Evening Ride
* 🚙 Drove 3.2 miles in 25 minutes
* 🏃 Ran 3.2 miles in 25 minutes
* 🚶 Walked 3.2 miles in 50 minutes
* 💪 Did 13pushups
* 👣 Weighed 153.3lbs

=== quotations ===
A minimal plaintext syntax for posting [[quotation|quotations]] which an auto-linker/formatter could use to style it properly.
