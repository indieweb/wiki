== Demos ==
* {{aaronpk}} measured performance metrics with webpagetest.org and took a snapshot.
** Identified easy things to take. One easily identified were fonts.
** Moved JS that are waiting for the page to load to the bottom of the page, they did not need to load at top.
** Sorted CSS and JS load order.
** Noticed that a CSS framework he is using takes a long time to parse by the browser. (https://semantic-ui.com/)
*** Taking as homework.
** Also saved a snapshot of a photos permalink, because those pages do different things on his site.
* {{sknebel}} worked on something that had not yet come up during the camp: theme switcher for his website.
** Can add a CSS filename to a query parameter to switch.
*** Made it so there is a default style that will load if a nonexisting filename is given.
*** Thinking about making it possible to Micropub a CSS file to the site and have it automatically become available as a theme
* {{sebsel}} jump started yesterday evening.
** Quill no longer worked with his IndieAuth implementation. So he created a new endpoint.
** The new endpoint parses the h-app for Quill and will render the logo of the IndieAuth client.
** ALso added support for scopes, so the Quill requested scopes show on the authorization screen.
* Marc Thiele
** Research: looking into existing plugins for Kirby3, for getting webmentions running again.
*** One from ...
*** One from {{sgreger}}: Commentions
** Thinking about implementing webmentions using Commentions
* {{tantek}} wanted to work on the <head> thing.
** Had to disable CSP to stop limiting CSS loads of ct.css
** Very few things showed up, as he has few things in <head>. All scripts load right before </body>.
** Would suggest that for progressive enhancement scripts should always be able to load at the end of body for all sites.
** Been looking at RSVPs, as it had been a while since sending. Had to manually send the webmention to the event page to get RSVP to show up.

=== Remotes ===
* {{GWG}}: I have a demo, if someone wants to show it. I updated my code for https://david.shanske.com/thisweek and https://david.shanske.com/onthisday to no longer show posts made this year, only in previous years. Also, added in a photo view. So https://david.shanske.com/onthisday/photos shows the photos only from /onthisday. And you can tell with the fact the icon next to the day changes from calendar to photo icon.
