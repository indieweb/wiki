What is the next thing you want to do, or do easier, or fix on your website?

Per "make what you need" [[principle]].

{{t}} I want to fix my photo grid on my home page, and then named pages like personal wiki pages

{{sebsel}} been using Twitter again, want his own site to be easier to post/tweet from. Especially replies are too much of a hastle. maybe backfeed if he's using the app anyways

{{sknebel}} saving private / semi-private things, for sharing with others and for my own use.
Some bookmarking solution that lets me save like 1000 browser tabs, that's not something I want to put on my bookmarks publicly on my site.

{{gwg}} Working on making my read->post flow work more smoothly. (Yes)

{{marcthiele}} would like to communicate more through his website. automate getting things posted on site and other places, ideally from personal site

{{aaronpk}} be able to make some private posts, easier version: only I can see. Extra stretch goal, being able to share stuff with a few other people ([[audience]]).

{{calumryan}} restore features working from my old site, with my new CMS ([[Kirby]]),  like [[Micropub]] support.

FYI {{t}} created a new POSSE diagram for the [[POSSE]] page in response to the [[website-analytics#IndieWeb_Community_Analytics|IndieWeb site traffic]] from the HN post, hopefully help more people understand it for the first time. Also include a deep link to a 1min video intro. 

Might help to also do the same for other popular pages like [[Webmention]].
