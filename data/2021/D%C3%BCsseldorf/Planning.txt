Next steps: (for organizer notes while we're figuring this out)
* {{marcthiele}}: Confirm venue & venue details (e.g. number of breakout rooms, windows to open for ventilation)
* {{marcthiele}} & {{jkphl}} maybe figuring out a spot nearby for the informal small gatherings the evening of 2021-11-10 (~19:00-20:00)
* Done: Contact Jules about possible photography opportunity for the IWC, had conflict.
* Find at least tentative remote participation support (volunteer or co-organizer)
