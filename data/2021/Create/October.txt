* {{jeremyrader}} I'll be adding styling to the rather bland site that I set up earlier this week. I also had an idea for adding open graph tags to comments on my site so that I can display them via the link previews in Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. I've been working on generating the comment as an image that can be shared through og:image 
* {{davidschmudde}} Working on IndieLogin capabilitys for my blog. I'm here: https://schmud.de/
* {{fluffy}} Hoping to rewrite/refactor the templates for https://beesbuzz.biz/ which have gotten ridiculously convoluted and unwieldy
* {{chrisaldrich}} Cleaning out some problems from a recent database issue
* {{dariusdunlap}} Moving my WordpressMP server to a new hosting company and re-implementing everything on updated Ubuntu, which likely means re-implementing NGINX, certs, PHP (updated) and various Wordpress details. Of note, this is replacing a server that I first brought up on DigitalOcean many years ago at IndieWebCampSF. It's the home of my old blog darius.dunlaps.net, dariusdunlap.com, and feedthegirl.com (my food blog)
* {{benatkin}} Converting WordPress site to Vite
== Notes ==
=== Books ===
Books vs movies, is there enough overlap to do them together, or should they be separate things?
one difference: people usually finish movies in one sitting, people don't usually finish books in one sitting

lots of overlap between books, podcasts, movies
* [[indiebookclub]]
* [[Letterboxd]]
* https://micro.blog/discover/books/grid
* https://www.proporti.onl/ - "Estimate the gender distribution of your followers and those you follow,
based on their profile descriptions or first names"
* granary.io - " Fetches and converts data between social networks, HTML and JSON with microformats2, ActivityStreams 1 and 2, Atom, RSS, JSON Feed, and more."

=== HTML5 Semantic Elements ===
Whether to use global heading levels (h1, h2, h3) or reset heading level when inside an article or section tag back to h1?
* HTML5 Outline algorithm wasn't really interoperably implemented (if at all) across browsers etc.
* {{t}} decided to use global heading levels in a page because they‚Äôre more broadly predictably supported

When to use article vs. section vs. div vs...
* {{fluffy}} keeps on reading up on the HTML5 spec on when article/section/etc. are used, and always finds it very confusing. In particular, never sure whether to put &lt;section&gt; outside and/or inside &lt;article&gt;
* {{t}} used to try very hard to always use the right HTML5 semantic elements for all cases, but found it was a lot of effort for what seemed to be little or no benefit, and simplified down to just divs (or other basic elements like paragraphs) with class names. However after doing some research on screen readers and how they treat HTML5 semantic elements, there's enough benefits to *sometimes* use *some* of them, and has a specific to-do on this: https://indieweb.org/Falcon#HTML5_semantic_elements_for_accessibility
