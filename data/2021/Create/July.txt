== Notes ==
* {{capjamesg}} is improving his blog search engine at https://search.jamesg.blog (but is in the UK so most / all work is not happening on call)
* {{aaronpk}} is building an [[IndieAuth Ticket Auth]] implementation
* {{martijnvdven}} is adding data to his homepage that will only show when a Bearer token is provided from the ticket auth.
** Finished and live: when using a valid Bearer token the URL of the "logged in" user shows at the top of the page, and the visitor is given a preview of the future profile photo.
* {{tracydurnell}} is designing a mushroom [[mascot]] and working on the [[2021/homepage]] proposed update.
** first sketches at https://tracydurnell.com/2021/07/10/mushroom-mascot-design-indieweb-create-day/
* {{astralbijection}} is continuing her sweeping rewrite of her website. 

=== {{gwg}} ===

* Abstracted out the external token store and enhanced it to expire or refresh old tokens if an expiry is set.
* Fixed error messages based on other people testing.
