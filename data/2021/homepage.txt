<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>2021 homepage</dfn>''' is an expansion of the [[2019/homepage]] project, a proposal to update some language and layout on the [[site-homepage|homepage]] to address identified barriers and reach various audiences, incorporate the three-way-entry route into the IndieWeb as per the 2019 proposal, and add more visual elements.</span>

== Why Update the Homepage ==

=== Desired Outcomes for the Community ===
* Visitors '''rethink their approach to using the web''' and consider what a better web would look like
* More people of all skill levels '''follow IndieWeb practices''' 
* More people of all skill levels and disciplines '''attend IndieWeb events'''
* More developers '''build their own IndieWeb friendly [[projects]]'''
* More developers '''contribute to existing IndieWeb projects and [[specifications]]'''
* More people '''contribute to the wiki'''
* '''Recruit more diverse participants''', especially women, people of color, and non-developers
* Maintain [[code-of-conduct|'''inclusive, respectful community''']] and conversations
* [[wikify|Add other desired goals]]...

=== Goals for the Homepage ===
* Clearly explain '''what the [[IndieWeb]] is'''
* Make the case for '''[[why]] the Indie Web'''
* Make it clear '''[[Getting_Started|how people can participate]]''' in various aspects of the Indie Web:
** How they can go IndieWeb for their own web presence
** How they can contribute to building the IndieWeb
** How they can participate in IndieWeb conversations and meet other people in the IndieWeb
* Provide '''entry points to the wiki''' 
* Promote upcoming IndieWeb '''[[events]]'''
* '''Show some people who participate in the IndieWeb''' as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof social proof], a way for those interested to "dive in" to examples of IndieWeb websites, and demonstrate that it’s actively used
* [[wikify|Add other goals for the homepage]]...

=== Goals of Proposal ===
* Make homepage more '''welcoming to non-developers''' (while still welcoming developers)
* '''Incorporate "three tiers" options''' for getting started from [[2019/homepage]] project 
* Provide a little more '''context and explanation of the IndieWeb''' and ensure key info is clear upfront, before sending people into the wiki, events, and chat
* '''Reduce the friction''' of getting started
* '''Address barriers''' to participation 
* Use more '''inviting language''' and replace niche terms like "[[selfdogfood]]"
* '''Add more graphics / visuals''' to the homepage to make it more visually engaging
* [[wikify|Add other current goals for updating website]]...

== Who's It For and What Do They Need == 

=== Audience of Homepage ===
* '''Developers''' who are interested in building their own projects and/or contributing 
* '''Bloggers and website hobbyists''' who already have their own website (self-hosted or using a service like wordpress.com) but are interested in owning their identity across the web
* '''Social media users''' who are fed up with Facebook and Twitter and other silos owning their content, but don't have their own website yet
* '''"Idealists"''' who don’t want to support the dark patterns of the corporate web anymore
* '''Businesses''' or organizations who are considering making their project Indie Web [[friendly]]
* [[wikify|Add other key audiences]]...

=== Barriers to IndieWeb Participation ===

* '''Awareness''' of the IndieWeb
* Perceived '''difficulty of joining''' / implementing
* Lack of clarity around '''what "joining the IndieWeb" entails'''
* '''No single path''' / plug and play option 
* Possible perception that it’s '''"for" or mostly developers'''
* [[wikify|Add other barriers to participation]]...

== Contributors ==
* {{tracydurnell}} - happy to contribute writing and create graphics, but would want input / review by others (especially organizers and developers), and don't know the capabilities and limitations of wiki layout and content well so would appreciate help on that front 
** thoughts above are coming from my background in marketing and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing social marketing], as well as my own experience last year visiting the website for the first time and coming to understand what the IndieWeb is and does
** I am not a developer so I might be biased in that direction and also had to guess what the goals there are 
** I’ve tried to reflect what I’ve heard from coming to IndieWeb conversations but am a relative newcomer and don’t have a great understanding of all the "infrastructure" of the IndieWeb
