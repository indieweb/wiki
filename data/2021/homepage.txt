{{stub}} 

<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>2021 homepage</dfn>''' is an expansion of the [[2019/homepage]] project, a proposal to update some language and layout on the [[site-homepage|homepage]] to address identified barriers and reach various audiences, incorporate the three-way-entry route into the IndieWeb as per the 2019 proposal, and add more visual elements.</span>

== Why Update the Homepage ==

=== Desired Outcomes for the Community ===
* Visitors '''rethink their approach to using the web''' and consider what a better web would look like
* More people of all skill levels '''follow IndieWeb practices''' 
* More people of all skill levels and disciplines '''attend IndieWeb events'''
* More developers '''build their own IndieWeb friendly [[projects]]'''
* More developers '''contribute to existing IndieWeb projects and [[specifications]]'''
* More people '''contribute to the wiki'''
* '''Recruit more diverse participants''', especially women and non-binary people, people of color, and non-developers
* Maintain [[code-of-conduct|'''inclusive, respectful community''']] and conversations
* [[wikify|Add other desired goals]]...

=== Goals for the Homepage ===
* Clearly explain '''what the [[IndieWeb]] is'''
* Make the case for '''[[why]] the Indie Web'''
* Make it clear '''[[Getting_Started|how people can participate]]''' in various aspects of the Indie Web:
** How they can go IndieWeb for their own web presence
** How they can contribute to building the IndieWeb
** How they can participate in IndieWeb conversations and meet other people in the IndieWeb
* Provide '''entry points to the wiki''' 
* Promote upcoming IndieWeb '''[[events]]'''
* '''Show some people who participate in the IndieWeb''' as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof social proof], a way for those interested to "dive in" to examples of IndieWeb websites, and demonstrate that it’s actively used
* [[wikify|Add other goals for the homepage]]...

=== Goals of Proposal ===
* Make homepage more '''welcoming to non-developers''' (while still welcoming developers)
* '''Incorporate "three tiers" options''' for getting started from [[2019/homepage]] project 
* Provide a little more '''context and explanation of the IndieWeb''' and ensure key info is clear upfront, before sending people into the wiki, events, and chat
* '''Reduce the friction''' of getting started
* '''Address barriers''' to participation 
* Use more '''inviting language''' and replace niche terms like "[[selfdogfood]]"
* '''Add more graphics / visuals''' to the homepage to make it more visually engaging
* [[wikify|Add other current goals for updating website]]...

== Barriers to IndieWeb Participation ==
* '''Awareness''' of the IndieWeb
* Perceived '''difficulty of joining''' / implementing
* Lack of clarity around '''what "joining the IndieWeb" entails'''
* '''No single path''' / plug and play option 
* Possible perception that it’s '''"for" or mostly developers'''
* [[wikify|Add other barriers to participation]]...

== Who's It For and What Do They Need == 

=== Audience of Homepage ===
==== '''Developers''' ====
Developers who are interested in building their own projects and/or contributing need to:
* understand how the IndieWeb is different from other projects they may have encountered (specifics?)
* understand how they can make their own website IndieWeb friendly
* learn about IndieWeb standards, protocols, and tools, and how they can create their own or contribute to existing ones
* see examples of IndieWeb websites and projects by other developers
* [[wikify|Add other needs]]...

==== '''Bloggers and hobbyists''' ====
Bloggers and website hobbyists who already have their own website (self-hosted or using a service like wordpress.com) but are interested in owning their identity across the web need to:
* understand what the IndieWeb is and the benefits of participating
* learn how they can update their current website to be IndieWeb friendly
* learn how to use a CMS such as Wordpress to set up an IndieWeb friendly website
* see other people using the IndieWeb at their skill level
* [[wikify|Add other needs]]...

==== '''Social media users''' ====
Social media users who are fed up with Facebook and Twitter and other silos owning their content, but don't have their own website yet need to:
* understand what the IndieWeb is and the benefits of participating
* learn how they can use a service such as Micro.blog to get started quickly
* see other people using the IndieWeb at their skill level
* [[wikify|Add other needs]]...

==== '''Businesses''' ====
Businesses or organizations who are considering making their project Indie Web [[friendly]] need to: 
* understand what the IndieWeb is and why their sites / tools / projects should support it
* learn what would be needed to be IndieWeb friendly
* see other businesses and organizations that support the IndieWeb
* [[wikify|Add other needs]]...

[[wikify|Add other key audiences]]...

== Potential Graphics ==
* People - if we're going to call ourselves a people-centric web we really should show some people ;) Could take a variety of forms like:
** Static grid image including a lot of people
** 3-5 "Testimonial" style features showcasing individuals (opt-in of course) with a quote about why they like the Indie Web - could be swapped out periodically but that takes maintenance ;)
** More prominent / larger photo of IndieWebCamp
** Facepile of a lot of people with links to their websites (opt-in)
** Set of mini-testimonial/quotes - like how some websites pull in tweets from people using their products
** [[wikify|Add other suggestions for showing people]]...
* Visualization of how the IndieWeb works on an individual level - could be more conceptual and decorative, or specific with visual representation of how a tweet could be syndicated to Twitter and replies synced back, etc. 
* Visualization of how the IndieWeb works on a broader scale - many individual websites communicating with each other - I think this would be better at a more conceptual level - could also use a mushroom and hyphae graphic if shrooms win the [[mascot]] pick
* Logo soup of IndieWeb friendly businesses (like in current footer but could do it in color / higher up / include non-sponsors)
* Three icons representing the [[2019/homepage|three "routes"]] for having an IndieWeb website - with a mushroom [[mascot]] could use three different mushrooms of different types and colors, or a single mushroom up to a huge bunch, or zooming out from a single mushroom to a mushroom on a log to a broader forest scene (maybe even with fungus underground)
* Embedded video intro to the IndieWeb (is that possible?)
* Sidescroller collection of website features to help people check out examples in practice (is that possible?)
* [[wikify|Add other graphic ideas]]...

== Contributors ==
* {{tracydurnell}} - happy to contribute writing and create graphics, but would want input / review by others (especially organizers and developers), and don't know the capabilities and limitations of wiki layout and content well so would appreciate help on that front 
** thoughts above are coming from my background in marketing and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing social marketing], plus my own experience last year visiting the website for the first time and coming to understand what the IndieWeb is and does
** I am not a developer so I had to guess what the goals there are 
** I’ve tried to reflect what I’ve heard from coming to IndieWeb conversations but am a relative newcomer and don’t have a great understanding of all the "infrastructure" of the IndieWeb

== Next Steps ==
# Make sure the barriers, audience and goals accurately reflect what the community wants – is this the appropriate audience and pitch for the current time?
# Identify most important info to include and pages to link to
