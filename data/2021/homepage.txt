{{stub}} 

<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>2021 homepage</dfn>''' is an expansion of the [[2019/homepage]] project, a proposal to update some language and layout on the [[site-homepage|homepage]] to address identified barriers and reach various audiences, incorporate the three-way-entry route into the IndieWeb as per the 2019 proposal, and add more visual elements.</span>

== Why Update the Homepage ==

* [[wikify|Add other desired goals]]...

=== Goals for the Homepage ===

* Provide '''entry points to the wiki''' 
* Promote upcoming IndieWeb '''[[events]]'''

* [[wikify|Add other goals for the homepage]]...

=== Goals of Proposal ===
* Make homepage more '''welcoming to non-developers''' (while still welcoming developers)
* '''Incorporate "three tiers" options''' for getting started from [[2019/homepage]] project

* '''Address barriers''' to participation 
* Use more '''inviting language''' and replace niche terms like "[[selfdogfood]]"
* '''Add more graphics / visuals''' to the homepage to make it more visually engaging
* [[wikify|Add other current goals for updating website]]...

== Barriers to IndieWeb Participation ==
* '''Awareness''' of the IndieWeb
* Perceived '''difficulty of joining''' / implementing
* Lack of clarity around '''what "joining the IndieWeb" entails'''
* '''No single path''' / plug and play option 
* Possible perception that it’s '''"for" or mostly developers'''
* [[wikify|Add other barriers to participation]]...

== Proposed Homepage Text (Draft 1: 2021-06-26) ==
[ ''NOTE: links, formatting and graphics to come in next draft'' ]

=== Control your identity. Own your content. Escape corporate silos. ===
When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Break free of corporate sites that treat you like a product and don’t care about your personal information – while keeping your connections with friends and family. 

=== The IndieWeb is a people-centered alternative to the corporate web ===
The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site and own your data. Read more → 

==== Why join the IndieWeb? ====
* Control your experience on the web and connect with people on your terms.
* Post what you want, when you want, without being hidden by the algorithm or censored.
* Send people to your own website instead of third-party sites.
* Own your content, so you won’t lose it if (when) a company goes out of business.
* More reasons to join the IndieWeb →

==== How does the Indie Web work? ====
You use your own website as your home base on the internet. Instead of posting directly on social media platforms, post on your own site. Then, syndicate the content to the sites you want so people you’re connected with there can read it. Their comments get sent back to your website, so you have a complete record. 

[ GRAPHIC ]

==== Who’s the Indie Web for? ====
There’s a place for everyone in the Indie Web! The IndieWeb is a diverse, inclusive community of people from around the world with a broad range of skills and interests, united by the vision of a better web and the goal to control our own content. 

[ GRAPHIC ]

=== Go Indie ===
Publish your content on your own website, and syndicate elsewhere (POSSE) to reach your connections. IndieWeb offers standards and tools to let you build your own home on the web. 
* Want something that just works without a lot of tinkering? Get going in minutes with an IndieWeb-friendly service.
* Want to personalize your home on the web without coding? Use an IndieWeb-friendly CMS on your own domain. (Or, IndieWebify your existing Wordpress install.)
* Want to build your own site? Integrate IndieWeb principles and standards into your own website. 

[ ''Visually, envision having these side by side in colored blocks with a little icon for each'' ]

=== Come to an IndieWeb event ===
==== Homebrew Website Club ====
Homebrew Website Club is a (bi)weekly meetup of creatives passionate about improving their own websites, sharing successes & challenges with a like-minded and supportive community. 

Homebrew Website Club meets fortnightly (every other Wednesday*) right after work, 18:30-19:30, across cities and online. 

==== IndieWebCamp and popup events ====
IndieWebCamp is a two day gathering of web creators building & sharing their own websites to advance the independent web. We spend a day discussing, and a day hacking & creating to empower ourselves and others to own our own identities and data.

Popup events are shorter online discussions focused on a single subject. During 2021 popup events are happening monthly.

More events are being planned! Jump on in and help organize and/or suggest dates, and locations for more! 

* IndieWebCamp Planning

=== Join the IndieWeb community ===
The IndieWeb community is an informal collective with events run by volunteers. We welcome everyone to participate, contribute, and share ideas at events, in chat, and in the wiki. Our code of conduct prioritizes respect and safety.

In the spirit of building together, keeping decisions transparent, making participation accessible, and documenting progress and process, we communicate using tools that are open, editable by all, and archivable. 

* Participate in the live IndieWeb chat
* Contribute to the wiki
* Read This Week in the IndieWeb for weekly highlights, or view all recent contributions

=== Help build the IndieWeb ===
The Indie Web embraces a plurality of projects – taking many different approaches to the same challenge. We encourage you to build projects for yourself and "eat what you cook" by using the tools you make. 

==== Use and contribute to projects and protocols ==== 
* Projects
* IndieWeb principles

=== Learn more about the IndieWeb === 
* Explore the IndieWeb wiki
* Watch recordings of IndieWebCamp sessions
* Follow news about the IndieWeb

=== Translations ===
''Use current text.''

== Questions / feedback about draft text ==
* It's probably too long - are there any sections that are less essential to have on the homepage and would fit better on another internal page? 
* Is the description of what the IndieWeb is useful and accurate? 
* Does this feel like a good representation of what the community is all about? 
* What's missing from the current homepage that needs to be kept front and center? 

== Potential Graphics ==
* People - if we're going to call ourselves a people-centric web we really should show some people ;) Could take a variety of forms like:
** Static grid image including a lot of people
** 3-5 "Testimonial" style features showcasing individuals (opt-in of course) with a quote about why they like the Indie Web - could be swapped out periodically but that takes maintenance ;)
** More prominent / larger photo of IndieWebCamp
** Facepile of a lot of people with links to their websites (opt-in)
** Set of mini-testimonial/quotes - like how some websites pull in tweets from people using their products
** [[wikify|Add other suggestions for showing people]]...
* Visualization of how the IndieWeb works on an individual level - could be more conceptual and decorative, or specific with visual representation of how a tweet could be syndicated to Twitter and replies synced back, etc. 
* Visualization of how the IndieWeb works on a broader scale - many individual websites communicating with each other - I think this would be better at a more conceptual level - could also use a mushroom and hyphae graphic if shrooms win the [[mascot]] pick
* Logo soup of IndieWeb friendly businesses (like in current footer but could do it in color / higher up / include non-sponsors)
* Three icons representing the [[2019/homepage|three "routes"]] for having an IndieWeb website - with a mushroom [[mascot]] could use three different mushrooms of different types and colors, or a single mushroom up to a huge bunch, or zooming out from a single mushroom to a mushroom on a log to a broader forest scene (maybe even with fungus underground)
* Embedded video intro to the IndieWeb (is that possible?)
* Sidescroller collection of website features to help people check out examples in practice (is that possible?)
* [[wikify|Add other graphic ideas]]...

== Contributors ==
* {{tracydurnell}} - happy to contribute writing and create graphics, but would want input / review by others (especially organizers and developers), and don't know the capabilities and limitations of wiki layout and content well so would appreciate help on that front 
** thoughts above are coming from my background in marketing and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing social marketing], plus my own experience last year visiting the website for the first time and coming to understand what the IndieWeb is and does
** I am not a developer so I had to guess what the goals there are 
** I’ve tried to reflect what I’ve heard from coming to IndieWeb conversations but am a relative newcomer and don’t have a great understanding of all the "infrastructure" of the IndieWeb
* {{addyourself}}

== Next Steps ==
# Make sure the barriers, audience and goals accurately reflect what the community wants – is this the appropriate audience and pitch for the current time?
# Identify most important info to include and pages to link to 
# Get feedback on and revise the draft text
