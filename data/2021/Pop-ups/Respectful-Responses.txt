'''<dfn>Respectful Responses 2021</dfn>''' was an [[2021/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2021]] session focused on enabling more positive serendipity & discovery via our websites, and raising preventative barriers to spam, harassment, and other unpleasant interactions.

How do we enable more positive serendipity & discovery via our websites, between both existing friends & family, and new positive interactions?

And how do we raise barriers to spam, harassment, and other unpleasant [[social media]] interactions?

It's not just "fixing [[comments]]", it's much more than that. 

Respectful [[responses]] include even simple interactions like [[likes]], [[bookmarks]], and [[reposts]], as well as indirect comments like [[quote tweet]]s.

A broader user-centric conversation about the problem that [[Vouch]] is designed to solve one or some parts thereof.
