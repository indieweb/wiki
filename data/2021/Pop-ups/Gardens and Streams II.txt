== Session Proposals ==
Moved to schedule below

See also: https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attending#Session_Scheduling for format/ideas 

Sessions are the heart of a camp. 

Unlike traditional conference formats BarCamps have a self-organizing character, relying on the passion and the responsibility of the participants. Attendees schedule sessions typically by writing on a large Post-It note or piece of paper and then placing them on a 'grid' of sessions by timeslot and conference room or space. 
Session proposals typically contain the following: 
    
*  A descriptive title
** A facilitator name for a session (almost always the person proposing the session)
**  A longer description about what might be discussed, brainstormed, or researched during a particular session
** A unique short hashtag that will be used to create an etherpad and other possible related resources for a session

Below are some potential sample topics we might consider. Feel free to flesh one out or propose your own either in advance of the event or on the morning of. We'll schedule them after the introduction that day.
* History of the space from commonplace books, to anthologies/florilegium, waste books/sudelb√ºcher, Zettelkasten, wikis, second brains, and digital gardens.
*  Transclusion
*  Format standardization plain text, text+wikilinks, Markdown, HTML?
*  Future of note taking
*  Integrating other tools for making your website (Roam Research, Obsidian, Notion, etc.)
*  IndieWeb building blocks
* Marginalia?
*  ... your idea here

* {{kevinmarks}}
** my old blog at http://epeus.blogspot.com was a kind of commonplace book, but I haven't really replaced it fully with http://KevinMarks.com yet; I tend to tweet things instead and rely on https://pinboard.in/u:kevinmarks to keep the links. I have previously downloaded  the tweets to http://kevinmarks.com/tweets but I need to adapt to the new downlaod format. I have used my site http://www.noterlive.com to take live tweeted notes on events and then save to my site like this: http://www.kevinmarks.com/indiewebcamplondon2020.html

=== Session 1 ===
* Different camps of thought in the digital gardening world. 
** Facilitator: [https://www.alasdairekpenyong.com Alasdair Ekpenyong]
** Some of us are here from the personal knowledge management (PKM) side of things, some here from productivity culture. Some are here from the zettlekasten world. Some are primarily writers, some are primarily interested in data. This session would be a chance for us to share/ speak about the different intellectual "camps" that we belong to. We would learn more about the values and beliefs that motivate each of us here to try to create digital gardens. We could benefit from putting these different schools of thought in conversation with each other.
** I wonder if this could be combined with Bill Seitz's ... what kind of community are we trying to build? How does this community interact? And why should this community want to work together?
** +1 {{kevinmarks}}
** +1 {{chrisaldrich}}
** +1 {{angelo}}
** +1 {{doubleloop}} (agree with maybe combining with Bill Seitz/Chris proposals)
** +1 {{tracydurnell}}
** +1 [[User:Christinwixson.com|Christin Wixson]]
** +1 {{h0p3}}

and some discussion on the following topic which was "merged":
* Meta ({{BillSeitz}}): What's the point/goal? What's the Theory of Change http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/TheoryOfChange? Right now adopting IndieWeb protocols takes work so you can join a network of.... 12 people. (I recently just built Twitter-search links into my wikilog pages, rather than bothering with WebMentions.) 
** Maybe the theory is that a small number of people are a [CreativeNetwork](http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/CreativeNetwork) of collaborators?
** Theory of Change I'm scratching at <miro board> https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l0-WNrM=/
** perhaps this links to 'inter-garden communication' idea from {{chrisaldrich}} - is connecting gardens part of theory of change?
** +1 for combining this with [https://www.alasdairekpenyong.com Alasdair Ekpenyong] ... who is the community and what is the goal of collaborating / being a community.
** {{kevinmarks}} - I find the Wardley Mapping approach very useful for thinking about this

session about learning more on the values and beliefs that drive each of us to this community
* there are lots of different words used to describe this community and interests
* e.g. **PKM** - efficient note taking, building a second brain, zettelkasten    
* some of us use it more for **writing**
** (Personal Knowledge Management)
** Tiago Forte's approach to having a "second brain" 
** also Cory Doctorow's [https://web.archive.org/web/20040616003452/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/01/01/cory.html outboard brain]
** Zettelkasten/Commonplace books

what brought each of us to digital gardens? what values brought us here?
* the article in MIT Review - https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/
** see paragraph starting "The new wave of digital gardens..."
* {{j12t}}
** not a garden, more overgrown, with weeds... "i'm a terrible gardener"
** i don't want the garden of versailles, but maybe that combined with permaculture  
*** what brought him here is to learn from others?

* bill
** what are you trying to accomplish?
** sometimes driven by a fear (eg. FOMO) or not organising notes well enough
** but why should you care if your garden is a mess?
** if you have three big ideas you want to promote, then that's the starting point

* {{chrisaldrich}}
** been in indieweb for serveral years
** building a site, recording lots of data, was functioning as a commonplace book
** had an aha moment when {{kevinmarks}} always popped up in chat with reference to his well-researched articles already built up, and linked to everything else - kevin's site was a commonplace book, chris then realized his was one too
** small simple [[note]]s, sometimes tweeting them out
** came to it organically, now going back and researching the whole space around it
** zettelkasten community often thinks that Niklas Luhmann invented the idea, but the idea goes back through most of the history of Western culture to ancient Greece out of the idea of commonplaces and the commonplace book tradition.
** [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/ Vannevar Bush] was likely talking about commonplace books in 'As We May Think' but not using the term has been a disservice to his readers

* {{PhilJones}}
** digital gardening, zettelkasten has strong resonance with what was happening 20 years ago with blogs and wikis
** the energy is very similar - how can we create our own space, use the internet to share it, learn to express multiple facets of ourselves?
** as a programmer, part of even older tradition, includes all attempts to make computing personal human level thing
** Doug Engelbart, interactive systems, Alan Kay, smalltalk a good history of this is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iAJPoc23-M HyperLand], which is just pre-web
*** another good history: http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/MemoryMachinesTheEvolutionOfHypertext
** unrealised current about how computer is a tool for augmented you as an individual
** how you learn about the world by building your own models (see e.g. Seymour Papert)
** Ted Nelson - building hypertext/xanadu to try and manage multiple thoughts and ideas
** [[User:C2.com|Ward Cunningham]] inventing [[wiki]]
** a lot of these ideas got lost with facebook, social media, etc, channeling us in to a useful format for them to sell ads
** indieweb was an attempt to push back on that
** digital gardeners is a new generation pushing back against this as well
** people want a digital garden because that's how the computer be a tool for us to make our own spaces

* {{kevinmarks}}
** building a repository of own knowledge on own website
** using [[Mastodon]], [[Twitter]], etc to feed some of that info in and back out again
** [[Cory Doctorow]] post highlights http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/2021-01-13-DoctorowPluralistic20YearsABlogger

* [https://www.alasdairekpenyong.com Alasdair Ekpenyong]
** combination of the garden and the stream
** daily thoughts go in to my garden, and i post to twitter less now, whatever goes there now is very intentional
** http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/StreamFlowVsGardenStock
** Humanizing the computer
** Alasdair's intentionality for Tweeting has increased by focusing on the garden first and Twitter second

Question by [https://www.alasdairekpenyong.com Alasdair Ekpenyong]: has your garden given you any insight, clarity? does computing feel more accessible?

* {{PhilJones}}  - feeling of inability to control software, mobile device
* {{angelo}} - wasn't until did literal gardening that he understood metaphor
* {{chrisaldrich}}
** intentionality. working in the garden (personal site/space) first, and only then sending to the stream
** double-entry bookkeeping accountants - "wastebook" running list (like fleeting note)
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book
*** aside: i keep hearing wastebook as Facebook haha (apt)
* [[User:Christinwixson.com|Christin Wixson]]
** feel like a bit of odd-duck, non-technical; coming from academia / teaching, uses tiddlywiki / stroll out of the box; for undergrads, the need for open-source / cheap solutions is important
* {{chrisaldrich}}
** some attendees also iAnnotate conference (earlier in 2021 https://iannotate.org/2021/), run by Hypothes.is https://web.hypothes.is/- web annotation software
* {{PhilJones}}
** not about being technical or too stupid to figure out - the major platforms are intentionally fighting against interoperability, openness, taking us to places we don't want to go, which is why we must embrace indieweb
* [https://www.alasdairekpenyong.com Alasdair Ekpenyong]
** interesting concept of - instead of googling for answers, searching your own personal knowledge base first (had heard it from Roam community)
* {{billseitz}} I used to write Markdown files on my phone and then sync them to my PrivateWiki. Have instead gone toward both  my spaces being in cloud/webapp so I can read/write from phone (or anything else)
* {{h0p3}}: My hypertext exists for many reasons, including to unify my absurd life, to speak with people (including myself), to contribute to the great human conversation, to function as an effective dialectical extension of my identity, and to make progress on crucial problems.   
** http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/ThinkingOutLoud
** http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SenseMaking
* {{doubleloop}} I come to the community from both the garden and stream perspectives. I've had an indieweb site for about 4 years or so, seeing this as more of the streaming side of things. I've had a digital garden in it's roughly current form since about 2020 (although obviously taking notes from before then). This came from a desire for better PKM and getting my thoughts in order. I do it to bolster my own ideas on technology, politics, the environment, and culture. *Learning in public* to motivate and to get feedback.  Recently I've also been publishing to Anagora. I kind of view it as a garden aggregator.  I see this as part of building a knowledge commons, an  alternative way of doing this to a centralised wiki. Multiple personal wikis combining.
* {{tracydurnell}} on a meta level I've found a better sense of when I'm reading a bunch of mental junk food versus things that make me think and make connections - I notice when I'm not saving many things - and also makes me realize when I'm spending too much time reading others' thoughts instead of thinking my own
* {{nsmsn}} I am very new to the IndieWeb, but I started a WordPress site to act as a kind of bridge between different  silos (are.na, reading.am) and the writing output on my main site. Not sure if its a garden or a commonplace book, or just another old school blog? It may take some time to see what shape it takes. I love WordPress' post formats (status, aside, video, quote, link) as well as the ability to tag things easily. I wrote a little about it in my intro post: https://log.nicksimson.com/hello-world/

The idea of a waste book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book

Hello, I'm mostly lurking, and not too qualified to discuss the grand or philosophical, but to follow up on the "polemic" of Phil a few minutes ago, and to the question from Alasdair that started the session, I found a very interesting argument from a link {{chrisaldrich}}shared about one month ago. Which is that we do this not merely to share ideas or have an online presence or make a cool looking site or whatnot, but to fulfill some kind of an ethical obligation or responsibility to the future of our species/civilization. And that the solution (to perhaps a very existential threat) includes things like the IndieWeb, ownership, self-publishing, "digital gardening," or whatever you want to call it
* https://twitter.com/ChrisAldrich/status/1419850851254890496
* http://ayjay.org/Tending.pdf

One thing that's very exciting to me is "ThreadReader" type bots on Twitter etc. I think there's a great need / scope for tools that can turn the stream back into a more permanent record. People aren't disciplined enough to persist / recycle their "waste",  but maybe bots / tools can do it for us :-)

* How does [[Loqi]] work?
** Loqi listens to chat for what is x? questions and returns wiki definitions, and also allows you to add 'what is' definitions to the wiki if one doesn't exist. There is also a way to append 'see also' lines to an entry 

https://anagora.org - a shared aggregated wiki community built by Flancian

* [[Hypothesis]]: https://web.hypothes.is/
** Example: https://boffosocko.com/tag/hypothes-is/

Is anyone providing paid [[Known]] hosting? (context: business models for non-BigTech tools)

Another cheap/lowtech possibility: see if [[Wikity]] can be revived http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/WikiTy



=== Session 2 ===
* The Next Step After Notes / Turning Notes into Thoughts and New Ideas [11:00 AM Pacific]  [18:00 UTC]
** Facilitator: {{tracydurnell}}
** What's your process for returning to past entries, whether to refresh and expand what you've noted and create connections with newer notes, revisit past thoughts, or connect and process into new thoughts / writings / projects elsewhere? 
** Is it needed to return to old notes? Or is the process of taking the note enough to get it working in your subconscious thoughts?
** How do you get others' input on your notes to add to and transform them? (Less from a technical standpoint, more from the thought of connecting others who'd have thoughts about the topic with what you've written)
* Interest
** +1 {{doubleloop}} - I tend to 'collect' a lot of notes, quotes, etc, am trying to be more conscious of connecting and creating new notes or 'notions'
** +1 {{PhilJones}} - I'm working on rennovating and cleaning up an old wiki, so very interested in ideas for what to do with older / existing notes.
** +1 {{gwg}}
** +1 {{angelo}} - what kind of entries deserve a return/edit? what's the goal of the entry?
** +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}} - i want to build an 'on this day' feature a la {{gwg}} then enhance that into a " do you want to revisit this post?" nudge -- or a "bundle up these five posts from category X over the last year into a retrospective?"
** +1 {{kevinmarks}} Cory's workflow is interesting https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/
** +1 [[User:Christinwixson.com|Christin Wixson]]
** +1 {{brunow}}

with a little bit of...
* Common Note Taking patterns [19:000 UTC]
** Facilitator: {{chrisaldrich}} and {{j12t}}
** What sorts of things are we typically capturing and how can the requirements for them be kept as simple as possible for publishing them online. How can these patterns assist in making site-to-site communication and collaboration as simple as possible? What does an IndieWeb notebook/commonplace look like?
** #NotePatterns
** +1 {{j12t}}: what are the actual use cases, and if it is distributed, what's the "distributed UX" (I mean less the code part than how people collaborate and interact)
** +1 {{brunow}}
** I wonder if this can be combined with Tracy's? What are the patterns of notetaking ... immediately and longer term?+1

{{tracydurnell}}: The previous session was about why we're taking notes. this session is about practicality.

{{angelo}}: in code, puts TODOs right next to the relevant code, otherwise doesn't get attention. can analog be applied to blogging?

Some use "note to self" or "[[TK]]" (a traditional editorial mark meaning "to come"; tk is an uncommon letter digraph from an information theoretic perspective, so searching documents for tk will almost always return things that are "to kome") in their notes/writing to come back to later.

{{chrisaldrich}}: wants [[Medium]].com-like TK as searchable metadata 

what works for Bill: just spew out the notes, will never write a polished post, casually

Nick: Maggie Appleton seedling budding evergreen metaphor  (https://maggieappleton.com/garden)
* Maggie's post about metaphors in carpentry and cooking: https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1440782656921161731
* https://brainbaking.com/ as a cooking/baking metaphor

{{tracydurnell}}: has changed the way I think, the way I read

{{j12t}}: team meeting notes. TODOs should be part of a to-do list and not sit in context of meeting. a data-structure and visualization issue (intertwingled). notices same concept but slightly different in github projects, folders, projects on omnifocus. see also under Johannes above (overgrown garden). especially in heterogeneous (rather than single organization) context

Bill: agenda that turns into notes, redundancy

[https://www.alasdairekpenyong.com Alasdair Ekpenyong]: Wishes to better visualize themes in graph one day

{{chrisaldrich}}: Ahrens - get down thought in writing immediately, Doctorow - at least expand on it enough so it's understandable to future you / someone else. Pseudo-private note-taking (Hypothes.is annotations) preceding publishing. How to not repeat yourself/duplicate between wordpress website and obsidian, no easy way to search your entire silo collection - this is why post everything in one place

{{kevinmarks}}: share link if only have one thing to say, write coherent blog post if has two (saved up, or remind of something else).

{{chrisaldrich}}: Sharing your written thoughts may feel obnoxious on sharing end, but usually not on receiving end

{{j12t}}: diarying on climate catastrophe, in git history, revisiting

Someone was talking about finding patterns in their writing. I've pondered that, too, thinking 1 interesting tool to use to summarize old pages: http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/StatisticallyImprobablePhrase

{{angelo}}: do you modify your old TKs/documents (long master), or create a new one and then link back to it? (so you can see evolution)

Bill: I might rename a page like "My dream life" into "My dream life from 2007", copy-pasting the contents

{{angelo}}: details/diffs of recent changes are almost like a stream coming from the garden

Nick: idea to auto link to internet archive for keeping track of progress/ past versions (esp if dont have skills to build it yourself)

{{chrisaldrich}}: recently [[WordPress]] provides [[RSS]] feed for most recent updates rather than most recently published, but pattern is not common yet in the wild.

Bill: usually want a (personalized?) bundled/rolled up diff since your last visit. 
* {{chrisaldrich}} mentioned that [[MediaWiki]] and Wikipedia has those sorts of links in emails

h0p3: better to tag pages we want to see diffs of, otherwise there's too much noise

{{j12t}}: conversation shifted from how to indicate recent changes to your own notes, to notifications in collaborative context

{{chrisaldrich}}: Flancian's anagora.org, maybe SFW

[[User:C2.com|Ward Cunningham]]: Write full sentences or I won't fork you! ;)

{{kevinmarks}}: [[Github]] makes forking the first thing you do, rather than the last thing you do (a bit like Federated Wiki), and you package up changes "here you go, take it if you like" - unlike previous model of open source with a maintainer/gatekeeper

{{PhilJones}}: in maintaining wiki over a long term, the challenge/question "is this still relevant?" more important (wayback machine often solves linkrot). Stewart Brand - shearing layers, buildings/architecture - each layer (of e.g. text) has its own lifecycle or degree of time it's valid for. Can't tell someone to even go to a Twitter post from 2 days ago; can't search month-old Facebook discussions

Bill: Tagging (e.g. seedling / 1% evergreen) as way to make easier to keep track of

{{chrisaldrich}}: Heraclitus: "you never step in the same river twice" (as it's constantly changing), even when you revisit it's from a new context

{{tracydurnell}}: more to discuss in future re how to deal with age and volume of notes

{{h0p3}}: I see myself as exploring, discovering, or creating new processes that I execute by hand. It's a human that picks out what is salient, and I'm not sold on automation buying me all that much outside of search and distribution. I require a variety of notetaking approaches, and I think it's not easy to generalize about how to do it well. Naming is a hard problem. I suggest the broader the telos of the hypertext, the more difficult it is to pin down the fitting way to engage in its practices. My prediction is that my notetaking will continue to evolve. I feel like I just have to go with the flow at this point.

{{tracydurnell}} another garden metaphor I use for thinking about writing / work is whether it's meant to be "annual" or "perennial" - annual is for of-the-moment thoughts, perennial is longer term that's meant to grow

=== Session 3 ===
* Crawling The Garden
** Facilitator: {{angelo}}
** We know how to ride a raft down the stream, how do we better navigate the greater garden of the web? follow a stream, crawl through the garden -- have your site/software/service crawl beyond the resources you immediately know to help you discover new and interesting things (people, posts, projects, ...).
***  Usefully map the mentions you find along the way.
** Interest
*** + 1 {{omz13}} - discovery via microformats of similar interests/cageories?
*** +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}}

*** +1 {{tracydurnell}}
*** +1 {{kevinmarks}} have you seen james's indieweb search? (<~YES) https://indieweb-search.jamesg.blog/

and bits of another proposed session that was "merged"
* Interop : Escaping Unrecognised Code
** Facilitator : {{PhilJones}}
** We have two contradictory requirements : to share data between different tools, to extend the powers of tools by adding new features. This inevitably means that each tool will have markup / data that other tools don't know how to handle or render correctly. 
**  How can we solve this? Can we invent a standard for "escaping" / encapsulating and rendering code from another site which our tools can't handle, but could at least render in a nice looking / comfortable way? 
** Interest
*** +1 {{kevinmarks}}: we have ways of doing this using post types already, but that does require the other site to have conforming markup.
***  #escapingunrecognised
*** +1 {{chrisaldrich}}

* Inter-garden communication (or backlinks across the web)
** Facilitator: {{chrisaldrich}}
** Backlinks within one's own digital notebook have become a big thing over the last two years as seen in many tools like Roam Research, Obsidian, Notion, etc. But what if my online notebook could talk to your online notebook and they could have a threaded conversation? What if they could also communicate with blogs or social media sites? In this session we'll discuss and outline how online wikis, digital gardens, notebooks, etc. can use the IndieWeb building block and W3C web standard Webmention to allow site to site communication

Search engine for indieweb sites by James expanded to 900 sites

Scrapability - http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/DigitalGardenStandards

An old wiki pattern: list of http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/AllPages

Curated recommendation engine, based on locally stashed full-text archives and weighted/scoped within neighborhood of your site/interests. browsable UX. taking advantage of modern large screen sizes

Note you can make a custom Google Search of a list of sites http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/GoogleCoop

{{kevinmarks}}: Spammers are very good at taxonomy, can use their alias network, it has meta-value
* Example: People who use dozens of hashtags on Instagram to attempt to improve on their [[reach]]
* Finally, spammers are contributing something ;) 

WebOfTrust (friend of a friend) http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/WebOfTrust

H0p3: wants persistent sidebar in browser showing any conversations related to content on web page

{{j12t}}: Also need to not exclude sometimes, or else remain in bubble (e.g. politics)

Bill: when build technology (e.g. search engine or payment processor) fighting spam and fraud eventually becomes 99% the name of the game

{{chrisaldrich}}: showing Flancian's anagora.org with a node as multiple contributors' pages with the same name. Stoa - a shared etherpad per node. One of the few actively experimenting with this specific problem.

H0p3: sharded/distributed by salience to you
- cheesy hack: Twitter search of PeopleYouFollow https://twitter.com/search?q=zettlekasten&src=typed_query&pf=on

{{angelo}}: idea of querying someone else's search engine

{{tracydurnell}}: e.g. "I know this person knows much more about $topic than I do"

{{chrisaldrich}}: Strong signal for a recommendation is if the person actually engages/consumes regularly (e.g. listened to every podcast episode) unlike Brief History of Time (one of most purchased but least read books)
* other doorstop http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/NewKindOfScience

{{chrisaldrich}}: most people are seeing problem through lens of Google trying to be massive memex for the whole world; rather than local mini-graph

{{angelo}}: wanted to talk about crawling because saw list of links when he crawled; various ways to notice a change on a site - crawlers naturally already have to handle that issue
