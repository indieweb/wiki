__TOC__
== Possible Topics ==

* How to Give a Microsub server access to private posts for its user(https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/1) - This is not strictly a Microsub issue, but there is a lot of interest. Assuming your Microsub endpoint is not tightly integrated with other endpoints, there needs to be some way to either pass info to it, or for the Microsub to request it.

* Feed and Item Metadata
** Indicating Item Source(https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/13)
** Multiple Authors https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/38
** Have Editable Feed Names and Other Feed Metadata(https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/23)

* Channel Method to include all Sources(https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/44)

* Retrieve Feeds Individually(https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/21)

* Adopt Standardized Format for Errors into Spec (https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/28)

* Photo and Video Sizes (https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/36)

* Allow Channel Ordering (https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/39)

* Add Location Property to Structure of a Single Post (https://github.com/indieweb/microsub/issues/45)

== Interest ==
Add your +1 for interest in this topic:
* {{t}} — I’d like to discuss re-orienting Microsub around people (h-cards) rather than / beyond / before feeds (h-feed, etc.)
* {{manton}}
* {{martymcguire}}
* {{angelo}}
* {{gwg}}
* {{jacky}}
* {{maxwelljoslyn}}
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{jamietanna}} - +1 on people not feeds, I'd be especially interested in linking Micropub's q=contact for discovery of people / have some way of linking different social platforms, so we can have i.e. a "friends" group that follows site / social media from the same interface
