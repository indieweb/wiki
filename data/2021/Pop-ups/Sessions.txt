If you're interested in hosting a pop-up session, feel free to use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

If you instead want to see a session happen or want someone else to host a session on a topic, please bring it up in IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] and see if you can find someone interested to host (and have them add it to the wiki instead of you).

As the session planning/development progresses and you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for 2021.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2021_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.

== Microformats Roundtable ==

Let's work through and discuss some of the open Microformats issue trackers. The proposal is to schedule 60, 90, or 120 minutes at a regular interval, either every month, every other month, or every 3 months, so we can finally address some of the long-standing microformats issues we have in the community. If we choose an alternating schedule, we can have different people from our various timezones each time.

{{chrisaldrich}} given that the Saturday 10am slot did so well for other the first time, perhaps we keep that and do a date in March or later? Add your preference and we'll try to pick a slot on/around January 14 to do additional planning and outreach.
We'll also try not to conflict with any potential IWC EU Online camp.

== Pipes ==

[[pipes]] are a way of providing some value-add for IndieWeb tools that are useful as part of some other service. Let's discuss some of the existing services, as well as brainstorm some alternatives that we as a community want to go after.

== InDWeb ==

Using DWeb tech on the IndieWeb. How can one leverage Tor/IPFS/Hypercore/Braid(OT/CRDT) on their website today? Also, a crash course of IW building blocks for people coming from the DWeb and an appeal to cross-pollinate by prototyping from your own site.

Add your +1 for interest in this topic:
* {{jacky}} - I'm currently working to make [[Koype]] a DWeb-first as well as IndieWeb-first site (around [[Hypercore]] for now), so I'm down to talk shop
* {{maxwelljoslyn}} - I'm hugely into Braid. I want to use it to enable cross-site goblin invasions. Count me ''in'' times 100.
* {{t}} - here to help cross-pollinate

== Webmentions Beyond Webmention.io ==
=== Details ===
[[Webmentions]] haven't really been revisited in some time (and with the advent of people leaning to [[Webmention.io]]). This is a chance to see what's been really wanted, what hasn't worked and where we can go with it.

Let's webmunch on the riddle of webmentions. How can we get more people hosting their own webmention sending, receiving, and validating?

How can we prevent [[Webmention.io]] from being the beginning and end of IndieWeb participants' use of webmentions?
