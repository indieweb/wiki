If you're interested in hosting a pop-up session, feel free to use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

As the session planning/development progresses and you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for 2021.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2021_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.

{{chrisaldrich}} given that the Saturday 10am slot did so well for other the first time, perhaps we keep that and do a date in February or March? Add your preference and we'll try to pick a slot on/around January 14 to do additional planning and outreach.
We'll also try not to conflict with any potential IWC EU Online camp.
