If you're interested in hosting a pop-up session, feel free to use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

If you instead want to see a session happen or want someone else to host a session on a topic, please bring it up in IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] and see if you can find someone interested to host (and have them add it to the wiki instead of you).

As the session planning/development progresses and you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for 2021.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2021_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.

== Microsub ==

[[2021/Pop-ups/Microsub]]

== Microformats Roundtable ==
Let's work through and discuss some of the open Microformats issue trackers. The proposal is to schedule 60, 90, or 120 minutes at a regular interval, either every month, every other month, or every 3 months, so we can finally address some of the long-standing microformats issues we have in the community. If we choose an alternating schedule, we can have different people from our various timezones each time.

Proposed:
* Name: Microformats Popup: Microformats2 Issues Resolution Session
* Description: (draft, feel free to edit/improve) <blockquote><p>Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.</p><p>Let's discuss how we can close out some outstanding microformats2 issues.</p><p>This is an intermediate session, with a prerequisite of basic knowledge of HTML and microformats. Experience with publishing and/or parsing is a plus. All are welcome.</p><p>More details will be posted over time</p></blockquote>

[[pipes]] are a way of providing some value-add for IndieWeb tools that are useful as part of some other service. Let's discuss some of the existing services, as well as brainstorm some alternatives that we as a community want to go after.

== InDWeb ==

Using DWeb tech on the IndieWeb. How can one leverage Tor/IPFS/Hypercore/Braid(OT/CRDT) on their website today? Also, a crash course of IW building blocks for people coming from the DWeb and an appeal to cross-pollinate by prototyping from your own site.

* {{jacky}} - I'm currently working to make [[Koype]] a DWeb-first as well as IndieWeb-first site (around [[Hypercore]] for now), so I'm down to talk shop
* {{maxwelljoslyn}} - I'm hugely into Braid. I want to use it to enable cross-site goblin invasions. Count me ''in'' times 100.
* +0 {{t}} - here to help cross-pollinate, and reality check, e.g.
** IPSF is a [[hashweb]], not a "DWeb" in any user-centric meaningful way

== Organizers ==
To discuss how we will decide to restart in-person events, reflect on how the online only model has worked for us, and other outstanding [[organizers]] issues.

Not sure if this is for you? See [[Organizers]] for a brief description of who is an IndieWeb organizer (changes every year!)

* {{maxwelljoslyn}} - if I understand the current (2021-05-12) definition of organizers, hosting a number of HWCs over the last year counts. I'd like to learn more about running larger Indieweb events, and in-person ones, so I can help do so in the future.
