If you're interested in hosting a pop-up session, feel free to use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

If you instead want to see a session happen or want someone else to host a session on a topic, please bring it up in IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] and see if you can find someone interested to host (and have them add it to the wiki instead of you).

As the session planning/development progresses and you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for 2021.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2021_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.

== Microformats Roundtable ==
Let's work through and discuss some of the open Microformats issue trackers. The proposal is to schedule 60, 90, or 120 minutes at a regular interval, either every month, every other month, or every 3 months, so we can finally address some of the long-standing microformats issues we have in the community. If we choose an alternating schedule, we can have different people from our various timezones each time.

Proposed:
* Name: Microformats Popup: Microformats2 Issues Resolution Session
* Description: (draft, feel free to edit/improve) <blockquote><p>Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.</p><p>Let's discuss how we can close out some outstanding microformats2 issues.</p><p>This is an intermediate session, with a prerequisite of basic knowledge of HTML and microformats. Experience with publishing and/or parsing is a plus. All are welcome.</p><p>More details will be posted over time</p></blockquote>

== Pipes ==

[[pipes]] are a way of providing some value-add for IndieWeb tools that are useful as part of some other service. Let's discuss some of the existing services, as well as brainstorm some alternatives that we as a community want to go after.

== InDWeb ==

Using DWeb tech on the IndieWeb. How can one leverage Tor/IPFS/Hypercore/Braid(OT/CRDT) on their website today? Also, a crash course of IW building blocks for people coming from the DWeb and an appeal to cross-pollinate by prototyping from your own site.

=== Interest ===
Add your +1 for interest in this topic:
* {{jacky}} - I'm currently working to make [[Koype]] a DWeb-first as well as IndieWeb-first site (around [[Hypercore]] for now), so I'm down to talk shop
* {{maxwelljoslyn}} - I'm hugely into Braid. I want to use it to enable cross-site goblin invasions. Count me ''in'' times 100.
* +0 {{t}} - here to help cross-pollinate, and reality check, e.g.
** IPSF is a [[hashweb]], not a "DWeb" in any user-centric meaningful way

== The Intersection of Analog and Online ==

How do our personal websites connect with and relate to IRL experiences? How are people playing with the boundaries of virtual and offline life? How can websites enhance physical places and things and events? Is there a role for analog interactions between websites? How do in person meetups fit in with building online community? How does knowing something will be documented online affect in person experiences? Should we try to bring the two spaces together (augmented reality?) or is it better to keep them distinct? (Throwing lots of ideas out there to see if anything sticks!)

Add your +1 for interest in this topic:
* {{jamesgoca}} would love to see this event, especially given his thermal printer projects (https://search.jamesg.blog/results?query=thermal%20printer) from earlier this year.
* +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}} - I'm hoping to eventually set up a "cockpit" display panel which uses LEDs, etc to show me the result of queries like "has created a post within last 2 days" and other possible metrics measured/generated by my site.
* +1 {{petermolnar}} - I've experienced working online communities as extensions or precursors to IRL events in the 2000s and I'd love if that would redevelop in this decade

== Organizers ==
To discuss how we will decide to restart in-person events, reflect on how the online only model has worked for us, and other outstanding [[organizers]] issues.

Not sure if this is for you? See [[Organizers]] for a brief description of who is an IndieWeb organizer (changes every year!)

* {{maxwelljoslyn}} - if I understand the current (2021-05-12) definition of organizers, hosting a number of HWCs over the last year counts. I'd like to learn more about running larger Indieweb events, and in-person ones, so I can help do so in the future.

== Revisiting [[2012/Positive_Arguments]] and the idea of self-expression ==
The goal of the session would be to discuss which parts are still relevant, which might 
have gone stale, and if there's anything missing, add it, while making the page into a bit nicer to read.

Another would be that I found this through searching for "self expression" is completely missing from the wiki. In my opinion, what made the internet such a wonderful place in the 90s and 2000s was the possibility to make a completely custom representation of one's self, including colours, imagery, everything. The epotime of this was probably Flash, the most popular of it was myspace profiles, and I'm starting to believe that we're losing this from the web.
