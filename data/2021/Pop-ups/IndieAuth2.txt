'''<dfn>IndieAuth 2 2021</dfn>''' was an [[2021/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2021]] session and the 2nd IndieAuth session of 2021.

== Summary ==

At the end of the last [[2021/Pop-ups/IndieAuth|IndieAuth protocol session]], there was a discussion of following up in a few weeks to finish what we could not. This popup IndieWebCamp session will continue the discussion to iterate and evolve the IndieAuth protocol.

=== Topics ===

* Make IndieAuth token introspection endpoint credentialed, so it is clear that this should only be used by Resource Servers. While there was a consensus on adopting the token introspection endpoint request and response, we did not conclude on what type of authentication.  https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/99
** Authentication is likely to be required, but in practice, requires further investigation (see below) 
** Aaron Parecki would like this to be some sort of dynamic client registration / "enrollment" that happens automagically when i.e. setting up a relationship with Aperture
** Discussion as to whether i.e. Aperture / other shared platforms could lead to needing some out-of-band authentication sharing - follow-up investigation required
** Jamie Tanna notes that, while integrating his IndieAuth server with OAuth2 clients, he found that the token_endpoint (not the token introspect endpoint, as mentioned on the call) may require `client_id` to be retrieved from `Authorization: Basic ...`, depending on how they work
** Jamie Tanna has implemented this, and integrated this using the Spring Security and rack-oauth2 OAuth2 clients, and allows for using empty authentication (which could then be HTTP Basic Auth)
** Consensus for now: Add to PR on introspection it is required, but not specify how at this time, allowing implementers to decide. 
* Introduce OAuth Server Metadata https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/43
** Jamie Tanna has a metadata endpoint now, getting it working was pretty straightforward
** David Somers has a metadata discovery facility: see https://toolbox.imoxia.com/#authmetadisco (now supports discovery using rel=indieauth_metadata)
** Rel=indieauth-metadata as opposed to rel=indieauth to indicate it is the metadata endpoint over being confused for the issuer URL. Opportunity to use - over _ as _ not allowed in http headers.
** May address #98 in that we could more easily add endpoints.
** Recommend placing it as .well-known for compat, but not require?
** Note about fallback to old endpoints for compat
* Consider adopting the iss parameter https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/101
** Dependent on the iss parameter being defined in the server metadata document. So, no fallback if there is a metadata document.
** iss value should be the home page of the indieauth server, and is expliclty not the authorization endpoint
* Discuss whether IndieAuth adopt resource indicators(https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/82) as a notation, and note any specific considerations for IndieAuth. Even though Ticket Auth prompted this, this is not specifically a Ticket Auth issue. Proposed PR https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/pull/96 
** {{jamietanna}} adds the `aud` of `https://www-api.jvt.me/` into all tokens, and currently does not enforce it anywhere. The enforcement would be added in the future, restricting at a resource server level whether the access token can be utilised
** Discussion is also around whether we use Resource Indicators for Ticket Auth
** Sample private post doing www-authenticate: https://toolbox.imoxia.com/private/codecow with a realm indicator
** Scopes may not be required if resources are provided, and this could be specified in spec.
** Whether an access token is issued changes from only whether scopes are requested to whether scopes or resources are requested
* Making the various token endpoint overrides consistent https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/98
** Rewrite Introspection PR to support metadata to no longer be part of token endpoint as proposal.
** Consider rewriting revokation to be defined as an endpoint with server metadata.
* Clarifying what names are returned in user profiles https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/93
** Define name in the spec and its application.
** It feels like the most straightforward solution would be to keep the existing "name" param and define it more specifically in the spec
* Clarify whether profile information is returned when a refresh token is used
* Consider adopting a userinfo endpoint, possibly after OAuth server metadata


* What clients can we test with?
* {{jamietanna}} has used https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-jwt/ to provide OAuth Server Discovery by $issuer or by $issuer/.well-known/...
** {{jamietanna}} seems to have found support in Spring Security https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/oauth2/client/registration/ClientRegistrations.html#fromIssuerLocation(java.lang.String)


=== Not Discussed ===

* Client Information Discovery improvements. 
**  Should this solely rely on Microformats? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/23
** Should we adopt a manifest file and what should be displayed if no app info discovered? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/64. #23 suggests other fields that might be relevant, such as the icon and name from the page.
