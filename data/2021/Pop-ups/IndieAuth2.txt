'''<dfn>IndieAuth 2 2021</dfn>''' is an [[2021/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2021]] session and the 2nd IndieAuth session of 2021..

== Summary ==

At the end of the last [[2021/Pop-ups/IndieAuth|IndieAuth protocol session]], there was a discussion of following up in a few weeks to finish what we could not. This popup IndieWebCamp session will continue the discussion to iterate and evolve the IndieAuth protocol.

__TOC__

=== Followup from the previous session ===
* Adding editorial notations to the spec regarding token lifetime, expiration and refresh tokens, to reference the OAuth2 specifications on this, and any specific considerations for IndieAuth. https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/81 
* Require IndieAuth servers to align with RFC7662 for OAuth2 Token Introspection was adopted, however auth for same is as yet unclarified.
* Allow clients to always exchange authorization codes at the token endpoint https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/58

== Possible Topics ==

* Make IndieAuth token introspection endpoint credentialed, so it is clear that this should only be used by Resource Servers. While there was a consensus on adopting the token introspection endpoint request and response, we did not conclude on authentication.
** Authentication is likely to be required, but in practice, requires further investigation (see below)
*** {{aaronpk}} would like this to be some sort of dynamic client registration / "enrollment" that happens automagically when i.e. setting up a relationship with Aperture
*** Discussion as to whether i.e. Aperture / other shared platforms could lead to needing some out-of-band authentication sharing - follow-up investigation required
*** {{jamietanna}} notes that, while integrating his IndieAuth server with OAuth2 clients, he found that the token_endpoint (not the token introspect endpoint, as mentioned on the call) may require `client_id` to be retrieved from `Authorization: Basic ...`, depending on how they work
*** {{jamietanna}} has implemented this, and integrated this using the Spring Security and rack-oauth2 OAuth2 clients, and allows for using empty authentication (which could then be HTTP Basic Auth)
* Client Information Discovery improvements. 
** Should this solely rely on Microformats? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/23
** Should we adopt a manifest file and what should be displayed if no app info discovered? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/64. #23 suggests other fields that might be relevant, such as the icon and name from the page.
* Discuss whether IndieAuth adopt resource indicators(https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/82) as a notation, and note any specific considerations for IndieAuth. Even though Ticket Auth prompted this, this is not specifically a Ticket Auth issue.
* Introduce OAuth Server Metadata https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/43
* Making the various token endpoint overrides consistent https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/98
* Clarifying what names are returned in user profiles https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/93
