__TOC__

== Possible Topics ==
* Client Information Discovery improvements. 
** Should this solely rely on Microformats? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/23
** What should be displayed if no app info discovered? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/64. #23 suggests other fields that might be relevant, such as the icon and name from the page.
* Discuss whether IndieAuth adopt resource indicators(https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/82) as a notation, and note any specific considerations for IndieAuth. Even though Ticket Auth prompted this, this is not specifically a Ticket Auth issue.
* Should Ticket Auth, as an IndieAuth extension, be discussed at this event? If so...
** Proposal to support the optional extension action=ticket to a token endpoint related to Ticket Auth. https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/87
* Introduce OAuth Server Metadata https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/43

=== Discussed ===
* Adding editorial notations to the spec regarding token lifetime, expiration and refresh tokens, to reference the OAuth2 specifications on this, and any specific considerations for IndieAuth. https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/81 
* Deprecate / remove the IndieAuth token verify endpoint, requiring IndieAuth servers to align with RFC7662 for OAuth2 Token Introspection
* Make IndieAuth token verify endpoint credentialed, so it is clear that this should only be used by Resource Servers
* Clarification on issuing tokens with only profile scopes. https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/62
* Allow clients to always exchange authorization codes at the token endpoint https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/58

== Notes ==
Possible topics are visible at https://indieweb.org/2021/Pop-ups/IndieAuth.
* https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/81 and expiry:
** {{jamietanna}} supports expiration, and issuing of `refresh_token`
** Discussion about whether we should add information about how to handle errors as an IndieAuth app (see RFC6749#7.2) https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/89
* {{jamietanna}} would like to discuss "Deprecate / remove the IndieAuth token verify endpoint" and moving the spec to be further aligned with OAuth2
* https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/33 - align/adopt RFC7662 token introspection
** {{jamietanna}} has implemented this, and integrated this using the Spring Security and rack-oauth2 OAuth2 clients, and allows for using empty authentication (which could then be HTTP Basic Auth)
** Recommendation is to not require authentication
*** At some point we should look into this though?
** Recommendation is to provide this under the token endpoint
*** Does this make sense? Why does RFC7662 expect it to be a separate endpoint?
*** {{aaronpk}}: it can be under the same endpoint, but Discovery endpoint could point to the same one
*** {{jamietanna}} should we make it clear in the docs that it could be different
** should `sub` be a property in the response?
*** {{jamietanna}} for example has:
{"active":true,"me":"https://www.staging.jvt.me/","scope":"draft","token_type":"Bearer","client_id":"https://tokens-pls.herokuapp.com","exp":1630780771,"iat":1630175971,"iss":"https://indieauth.jvt.me","aud":["https://www-api.jvt.me/"],"sub":"https://www.staging.jvt.me/"}
*** parked for now, as it's OPTIONAL and unclear if we need it for OAuth2 resource servers to integrate
** Authentication is likely to be required, but in practice, requires further investigation (see below)

* Make IndieAuth token verify endpoint credentialed, so it is clear that this should only be used by Resource Servers
** {{aaronpk}} would like this to be some sort of dynamic client registration / "enrollment" that happens automagically when i.e. setting up a relationship with Aperture
** Discussion as to whether i.e. Aperture / other shared platforms could lead to needing some out-of-band authentication sharing - follow-up investigation required

* {{jamietanna}} notes that, while integrating his IndieAuth server with OAuth2 clients, he found that the token_endpoint (not the token introspect endpoint, as mentioned on the call) may require `client_id` to be retrieved from `Authorization: Basic ...`, depending on how they work
