__TOC__


== Possible Topics ==

* Client Information Discovery improvements. 
** Should this solely rely on Microformats? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/23
** What should be displayed if no app info discovered? https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/64. #23 suggests other fields that might be relevant, such as the icon and name from the page.
* Clarification on issuing tokens with only profile scopes. https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/62
* Allow clients to always exchange authorization codes at the token endpoint https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/58
* Discuss whether IndieAuth adopt resource indicators(https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/82) as a notation, and note any specific considerations for IndieAuth. Even though Ticket Auth prompted this, this is not specifically a Ticket Auth issue.
* Should Ticket Auth, as an IndieAuth extension, be discussed at this event? If so...
** Proposal to support the optional extension action=ticket to a token endpoint related to Ticket Auth. https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/87
* Introduce OAuth Server Metadata https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/43

=== Discussed ===
* Adding editorial notations to the spec regarding token lifetime, expiration and refresh tokens, to reference the OAuth2 specifications on this, and any specific considerations for IndieAuth. https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/81 
* Deprecate / remove the IndieAuth token verify endpoint, requiring IndieAuth servers to align with RFC7662 for OAuth2 Token Introspection
* Make IndieAuth token verify endpoint credentialed, so it is clear that this should only be used by Resource Servers
