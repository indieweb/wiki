<span class="p-summary description">'''<dfn class="p-name summary">IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2021</dfn>''' are stand-alone single topic sessions originally started in 2020, partly in response to the coronavirus pandemic that prevented the long history of regularly occurring in-person camps in various cities.</span>

While different from traditional 2-day camps of sessions and creating, pop-ups are meant to foster ongoing in-depth discussion & development of topics of interest to the IndieWeb community.

== Scheduling Brainstorming ==

Unlike a physical event, online events allow participation from multiple timezones, but this creates a series of logistics problems. Currently, the largest amount of IndieWeb event participants come from the United States and Europe, which means most attendees will stretch from GMT-8 to GMT+1, making it a challenge to find the ideal time.

So far, the time that has worked the best has been a weekend at 9:30-10AM Pacific(GMT-8), which is 12:30-1PM Eastern(GMT-5), 5:30-6PM(UK/GMT), or 6:30-7PM European(GMT+1).

The challenge of a weekday is that, most people's work schedules, the best option for weekday attendance is in the evening. HWC meetings have started between 5-7 PM local time. The European meeting is at a time that can be attended by both of the European timezones with the most Indieweb participants. The American meeting is currently on Pacific time, as the bulk of the attendees are in this time, but is still early enough for Eastern time attendance.

Possible ideas
* Schedule sessions on either UK or Pacific time based on the number of participants from each location.
* Reduce sessions, which have been at 2 hours, to 1.5 or 1 hour, and possibly in 2 pieces. The 2 hour meetings have worked as it it allows for us to go a bit more in depth on a topic. 
* Schedule a session as late as possible on UK time, for example 8 or 9PM, which would translate to 3 or 4PM Eastern, or 12-1 Pacific, making it a 'lunchtime' session for the Pacific individuals.
* Schedule a session on a Friday at the 10am Pacific timeslot, which are "no at work meeting" days for some folks
