<span class="p-summary description">'''<dfn class="p-name summary">IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2021</dfn>''' are stand alone single topic sessions originally started in 2020, partly in response to the coronavirus pandemic that prevented the long history of regularly occurring in-person camps in various cities.</span>

While not designed to be the traditional two day camps of sessions and creating, they are meant to foster ongoing discussion and development of topics of interest to the IndieWeb community.
