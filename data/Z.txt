{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Z</dfn>''' is a suffix used on a time string to indicate that it is in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), a common technique for the time setting on indieweb servers, and used by programmers to avoid problems dealing with [[timezone]]s, especially in indieweb [[projects]].

Z time is also known as <dfn>Zulu time</dfn> (per military expression of Z), or <dfn>Zero hour [offset]</dfn> time.
