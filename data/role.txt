{{stub}}

'''<dfn>role</dfn>''' is an [[h-card]] property (marked up usually as "p-role") that can be used on a [[homepage]] to provide a [[summary]] of what that person does and/or how they perceive themselves, often providing a summary of what they [[post]] about.

== Why ==
A role is a brief way of introducing yourself, should reflect the things you post about, and thus is a good opportunity to provide readers of your website a personal summary of what is it that you do in general.

== How ==
Use the <code>p-role</code> property to markup your role inside your [[h-card]] on your [[homepage]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has had a role at the top of his homepage just underneath his name since ~2010(?).
