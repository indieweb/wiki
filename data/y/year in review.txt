'''<dfn>Year in Review</dfn>''' is a feature on some silos (like [[Facebook]]) as well as being a special kind of [[article]] on some IndieWeb sites that summarizes important aspects of the past year. In some sense these posts are derivative of and similar to handwritten letters that families might include in annual holiday cards sent to families and friends detailing their major annual updates.

=== GoodReads ===
[[Goodreads]] gives users a "Year in Books" that recaps their year's reading progress of what they read as well as the books they finished. Typically email reminders are sent out in early December, but the review page auto refreshes based on data updates at future times.
Example: https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018?int=YYiB18_sa

=== Pocket ===
[[Pocket]] regularly emails out (semi-private, but shareable) links to users to recap how many words they read during the year and the rough equivalent in number of books. They also advertise most popularly bookmarked articles and other discovery related features. [https://getpocket.com/stats/2018/20eddecb1a Here's an example of one such year in review post] from {{chrisaldrich}}

=== Strava ===
[[Strava]] annually creates a "Year in Sport" film for your profile, go to the year.strava.com to view it, e.g.:
* https://2018.strava.com/
* https://2017.strava.com/ (at some point they dropped it! "2017 Year in Sport videos are no longer available.")

=== Uber ===
[[Uber]] emailed out a "2018 year in review" on 2019-01-04 that was nearly devoid of content.
* Number of days since joining Uber, end of year rider rating - neither of which are specific to just last year
The rest of their email was about *their* overall year in review (not personal at all)

=== Swarm ===
Can be accessed here: https://www.swarmapp.com/user/year-in-review/2018
