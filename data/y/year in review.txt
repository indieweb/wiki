'''<dfn>Year in Review</dfn>''' is a feature on some silos (like [[Facebook]]) as well as being a special kind of [[article]] on some IndieWeb sites that summarizes important aspects of the past year, sometimes on specific topics like books [[read]]. 

In some sense these posts are derivative of and similar to handwritten letters that families might include in annual holiday cards sent to families and friends detailing their major annual updates.

There is a particular format of personal Year in Review posts/pages of "annual reports" which contain more extensive details and typically include metrics with charts and graphs, originally popularized by Nicholas Felton on his site Feltron.com from 2005-2014:
* '''[[annual report]]'''

=== How to write a year in review ===
{{section-stub}}

If you’re writing a year in review on or about your personal website, and are not sure what to add or how many things to list, read on.

Pick the top 5 things you did on your personal site (created, made, designed, built, blogged) and highlight them and why.

Even [[Spotify]] wrapped only lists your top 5 artists, and top 5 tracks you listened to. 

No need to feel pressured to document any more than that, but if you like make it a top 10 list, or pick a different criteria of what to include.

The nice thing about the "top 5" approach is that even on "slow" years, you'll likely have a top 5 things to document so you won't feel pressured to have to do more.

=== GoodReads ===
[[Goodreads]] gives users a "Year in Books" that recaps their year's reading progress of what they read as well as the books they finished. Typically email reminders are sent out in early December, but the review page auto refreshes based on data updates at future times.
Example: https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018?int=YYiB18_sa

=== Last.fm ===
[[Last.fm]] provides an annual review of a user's listening habits in their Last.year report, released in January each year. It identifies the user's top artists, albums, and tracks from the previous year, and provides graphs visualizing user's listening habits, such as time of day and day of the week, as well as trends in genres ("tags"). Listening statistics are compared against the previous year.   
* https://www.last.fm/user/_/listening-report/year

=== Pocket ===
[[Pocket]] regularly emails out (semi-private, but shareable) links to users to recap how many words they read during the year and the rough equivalent in number of books. They also advertise most popularly bookmarked articles and other discovery related features. [https://getpocket.com/stats/2018/20eddecb1a Here's an example of one such year in review post] from {{chrisaldrich}}

=== Spotify ===
[[Spotify]] creates a personalized "Spotify Wrapped" review in December each year, which highlights a user's top-listened artists, tracks, and genres, as well as other factoids that change from year to year. It's viewable only on the Spotify app, in a "stories" style format. They also create a playlist of the user's top 100 songs from the year. While presented as an end-of-year wrap-up, it only includes data from Jan. 1 through Oct. 31.

=== Strava ===
[[Strava]] annually creates a "Year in Sport" film for your profile, go to the year.strava.com to view it, e.g.:
* https://2018.strava.com/
* https://2017.strava.com/ (at some point they dropped it! "2017 Year in Sport videos are no longer available.")

Shows counts for check-ins, categories and New Places. Then below that there is a map showing all check-ins and top 5 lists of categories and places.

=== Tumblr ===
[[Tumblr]] has a year-in-review, from at least 2022:
* https://www.tumblr.com/fandom
E.g.
* https://fandom.tumblr.com/post/702448565057961984/its-that-time-again-its-tumblrs-2022-year-in [[Tumblr]]'s year in review for 2022 via their [https://fandom.tumblr.com/ Fandom site].

=== Uber ===
[[Uber]] emailed out a "2018 year in review" on 2019-01-04 that was nearly devoid of content.
* Number of days since joining Uber, end of year rider rating - neither of which are specific to just last year
The rest of their email was about *their* overall year in review (not personal at all)

=== Untappd ===
[[Untappd]] generates a "Year in Beer" for users each year that displays your most frequently checked-in beers, styles, venues, and friends. Some statistics are compared with those from the previous year.

== Brainstorming ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} has [https://chat.indieweb.org/2021-10-19#t1634663528522900 indicated] that since he compiles posts of what articles he [[read|reads]] and captures data about publishers and authors that it might be interesting to do a year in review of these to see which sources he's reading frequently, particularly as a means of adding more [[diversity]] to it.
