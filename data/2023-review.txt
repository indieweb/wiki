== IndieWebCampers ==
[[2014-review#This_Is_A_Movement|2014's grid of everyone]] who went to an IndieWebCamp looked great - let's make another one for 2023.

Grid of all the people who attended *any* 2023 IndieWebCamp from the Guest_List pages, with their names and domain names underneath their photos - everything linked to their domain. 

'''IN PROGRESS'''. Please add yourself if you participated in an IndieWebCamp in 2023, and feel free to add all others from any IndieWebCamp 2023 Guest List as well!

Please also help with ordering alphabetically by fullname - helps to avoid duplicates!
