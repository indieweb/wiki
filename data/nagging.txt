{{stub}}

'''<dfn>nagging</dfn>''' is when a site prompts you out of the blue to go do something for the site, like update your profile.

== Why not ==
Don't do this. Don't nag the user. It's annoying and disrespectful of their time.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] started to display (at least since 2015-07-16) an "Update Your Profile" box and message with a weird flower graphic when you view your own profile if they determine that you should update parts of it (for whatever reason).

Note the absence of a close box or any way of dismissing it.

Here it is in the context of a profile:
