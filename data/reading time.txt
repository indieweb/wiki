== Criticism ==
=== Bad reaction to being told ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455812120724 <blockquote>don't tell me how fast I read</blockquote>
=== First paragraph annoyance ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455805042207 <blockquote>I'm mostly annoyed when the first paragraph of a post in my feed reader is "3 minutes reading time"</blockquote>
=== Does not reflect actual time ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455827541363 <blockquote>maybe I don't like the "3 minutes reading time" thing because it never actually reflects the time I spend reading articles</blockquote>
=== Not useful seems arbitrary ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455827821693 <blockquote>i don't find that useful because I don't know what assumptions the author is making about reading times, so the time listed is pretty arbitrary from my perspective</blockquote>
