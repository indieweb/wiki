A '''<dfn>wiki page</dfn>''' is a type of web page that many in the IndieWebCamp community either want to or already host on their own personal site.

A wiki page is different from (and often hosted in addition to) sequential / time-ordered [[posts]], though both the [[edits]] and the entire [[versions]] from a wiki page's history are sequential and time-stamped.

== Essential Qualities ==
What makes a page a "wiki" page?

Essential qualities (of a wiki page as compared to other e.g. static pages). A wiki page is:
# '''editable''' - the page is editable from a web browsers, ideally any web browser, desktop, [[mobile]] etc.
# '''versioned''' - versions of the page are saved/stored, ideally with their own version-specific permalinks, typically with a permalink for each [[edit]] as well.
# '''version history''' - a visible list of revisions
# '''browsable versions''' - the ability to view past revisions and [[edits]]

== Additional Qualities ==
What are other common attributes of wiki pages?

Additional qualities:
* '''multi-authored''' - typical wikis and wiki pages have the ability for multiple authors to edit and change them. However, from an indieweb perspective, multi-authorship is not really an essential quality. E.g. indieweb posts and content authoring solutions are designed primarily for a single author.
* '''multi-platform interface''' - this is kind of a given for any indie *web* solution. A web standards based UI = multiplatform interface.
* '''categories / tags''' - Mediawiki in particular has the ability to "tag" a page with an explicit "Category:" which then turns into a link to a collection to all pages tagged with that Category. [[hashtags]] on indieweb post also work that way, and could possibly be re-used for indie wiki pages.
* '''templates''' - Mediawiki in particular has templates you can create and then use inside multiple pages. See [[template#HTML_based_template_formats|template: HTML based template formats]] for more thinking on how this might work with static HTML pages.
* '''backlinks''' - Mediawiki in particular has the "What links here" feature which you can click and see a list of all the pages that link to the current page. Such a feature could be useful for indieweb posts and wiki pages too - being able to one click see a list of all your pages/posts that link to a particular page or post.
* '''user contributions''' - MediaWiki in particular has a "contributions" page for each user/author that shows the [[edits]] that the author has made, to which pages, in reverse chronological order.
== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members that have wikis on their own personal sites:
=== Amber Case ===
[[User:caseorganic.com|Amber Case]] uses [[MediaWiki]] for her own wiki at http://caseorganic.com/wiki/ since [http://caseorganic.com/personal-wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=1 2011-07-11] which also supports:
* login via [[IndieAuth]]!
* editing by others if they login via IndieAuth and are on a whitelist(?)
=== Tom Morris ===
[[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] uses [[MediaWiki]] for his own wiki at http://wiki.tommorris.org/ since [http://wiki.tommorris.org/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=1 2013-04-01].

== IndieWeb Partials ==
IndieWeb community members that have some partial work towards a wiki on their personal sites:
=== Tantek ===
[[User:tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]] has a redirect on his own domain setup for wiki pages at /w/ since 2010(?), e.g.:
* http://tantek.com/w/ - Wiki home page
* http://tantek.com/w/WillpowerImprovement - a specific page
This way he can at least share URLs he owns to his wiki pages, where presumably a future self-hosted wiki will live rather than redirecting to the [[PBWorks]] silo.

== Hosted Examples ==
There are also various wiki hosting sites / [[silos]].

IndieWeb Community members that are using a silo (currently) to host their wiki (but likely want to or are trying to move it to their own domain)
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]] uses http://tantek.pbworks.com/ ([[PBWorks]] was originally PBWiki.com)
* ...

== Brainstorming ==

Thoughts on how an IndieWeb wiki could be implemented:
* In short: Static Pages Plus HTTP Headers
Additional variants of wiki pages:
* [[geo-wiki]]
