'''<dfn>[https://ipfs.io IPFS]</dfn>''' is short for <dfn>InterPlanetary File System</dfn>, potentially a [[static site]] storage method, yet does not appear to be [[selfdogfood]]ed, and thus should be considered risky and experimental at best; also apparently unrelated to NASA’s actual Interplanetary [[Solar System Internet]] (SSI) being built on their [https://www.nasa.gov/content/dtn Disruption Tolerant Networking].

IPFS is self-described as “a new hypermedia distribution protocol”.

There are no human names on its website (https://ipfs.io), except the title of a video has the name “Juan Benet” as a presenter, whose website appears to be http://juan.benet.ai/, a static site with no mention nor evidence that it itself uses IPFS (lack of [[selfdogfooding]]) as of 2016-02-10 (site appears unchanged since 2014).

== Events ==
There have been [http://calagator.org/events/tag/ipfs some IPFS meetups] in Portland, Oregon starting in July 2015.
