The phrase '''<dfn>social business</dfn>''' may refer to:
* a '''business with a social objective''', i.e. created and designed to address a social problem, and is a non-loss, non-dividend company.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_business]
*  a '''business leveraging the impact of social networks''' such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] in their marketing and communication strategies[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_business#Disambiguation:_social_enterprise_and_social_network_business][http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/]
* a '''business using [[social technology]] internally''' (intranet, enterprise)

The phrase is prominently used in the description of the [[2013/osfw3c|2013 W3C Social Web workshop]], likely intending the non-social-objective meanings above.
