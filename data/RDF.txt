{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDF</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Recursive Descent Forever, a way of expressing [http://www.shirky.com/writings/herecomeseverybody/semantic_syllogism.html syllogisms] so that the subject, object, and predicate are all URLs. In order to prevent the need to fetch these URLs to make sense of things, they were redefined as URIs that don't have to resolve, but exist in the Platonic realm.

Okay, okay, actually RDF is an abbreviation for Resource Description Format, an early-ish part of the XML development efforts that became known as the Semantic Web, and later Linked Data. As the above jokey-times suggest, these efforts have long had a reputation for not being very practical. [[Microformats]] began in part as a reaction against their verbosity and extra technical layers.

RDF developers eventually took some tips from microformats in turn (if not all the tips they could have), and created [[RDFa]] and [[JSON-LD]]. These newer formats come across to the untrained eye as less academically obsessive.
