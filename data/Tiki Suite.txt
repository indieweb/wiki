''Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware'' runs on shared hosting and has pretty much all the features you could ever need for your personal site. As of 2014-10-13, it doesn't have IndieWeb features (h-card, rel-me), but those can be added as built-in (but optional) features. Not those pesky extensions that just break at the next upgrades :-)  The [https://profiles.tiki.org/Personal_Blog_and_Profile_12x Personal Site Profile] could be improved to by default support all IndieWeb features.

While ''Tiki Suite'' is designed for organizations with 10-50 user accounts or so, nothing prevents you from using it for just one person! Beyond your domain name, you'll want email, calendar, XMPP, etc. There are FLOSS components for just about any feature / tool to manage your own data:
