'''<dfn>[https://www.parse.com/ Parse]</dfn>''' was a [[mobile]] backend as a service company that was acquired by [[Facebook]] in 2013, who subsequently shut down the service 2017-01-28, yet Parse still released their software as open source, including SDKs, libraries, and their Parse Server, so you can setup and manage your own mobile backend as a service, which is what you had to do before Parse.

== Features ==

* data [[storage]]
* [[identity]]/login management
