'''<dfn>on this day</dfn>''' is a feature of several silos where they show you posts you made on the current (typically Gregorian) day of the year in previous years.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Google Photos]]
Makes a little collage of images that links to a set of photos, and notifies you. Example: 
[[File:google-onthisday.jpg|400px]]

== Services ==
* [[Timehop]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== Ordinal Day ===
{{t}} if I implement this (which Iâ€™m considering for [[Falcon]]), I will implement it with ordinal day of the year instead of Gregorian day, which will trade February 29th only happening once every four(ish) years with day 366 only happening every four(ish) years.
