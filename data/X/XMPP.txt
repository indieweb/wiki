'''Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (<dfn>XMPP</dfn>)''' is an open [[messaging]] standard for cross-platform instant-messaging interoperability, previously supported by the [[Google Talk]] messaging service and [[Twitter]], and something you can support on your personal site.

== Why ==
By supporting XMPP on your personal site, you can use your own domain as your XMPP identity to chat with other folks using XMPP, without having to register on another service!

=== Bridging Web and XMPP ===
Up until recently the XMPP world and the Web world rarely crossed, but now thanks to work on [https://github.com/legastero/stanza.io stanza.io] and [https://github.com/xmpp-ftw/xmpp-ftw XMPP-FTW] you can now "talk" XMPP directly from the web.

The two most advanced social-networking applications built on XMPP are [https://movim.eu Movim] and [https://salut-a-toi.org/ Salut Ã  Toi]. Both provide a gateway to expose the content on the web, with public access for public content.

== Standards ==
The core part of XMPP is now an IETF RFC: [http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/rfcs/ RFC-6120].

=== PubSub ===
XMPP has a PubSub protocol for social-networking, as defined in [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#impl-uri XEP 0060].

=== URIs ===
All content throughout the XMPP network has a unique URI. Here's a list of common URI representation of resources:
* user: xmpp:user@host
* PubSub node: xmpp:pubsub.host?;node=nodeName
* PubSub publication: xmpp:pubsub.host?;node=nodeName;item=ae890ac52d0df67ed7cfdf51b644e901

== Issues ==
General issues: 
* massive spec
* no one has ever fully implemented it
* there's no comprehensive (or even feature covering) test suite
* everyone who tries to implement it, only ever implements a subset of it
* interop requires testing with every implementation you want to interoperate with (instead of just with a standard test suite)
