'''Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (<dfn>XMPP</dfn>)''' is an open [[messaging]] standard for cross-platform instant-messaging interoperability, previously supported by the [[Google Talk]] messaging service and [[Twitter]], and something you can support on your personal site.

== Why ==
By supporting XMPP on your personal site, you can use your own domain as your XMPP identity to chat with other folks using XMPP, without having to register on another service!

== How to ==
=== How to make an XMPP identity ===
You can either register your identity on a free service, or you can set-up an XMPP server on your site and use that to present your XMPP identity.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Peter Molnar ===
{{petermolnar}} has been running his own XMPP server on his domain since at least 2021 per
https://petermolnar.net/article/xmpp/index.html

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} added XMPP support to his site in 2022-??-?? for use in IETF meetings.

=== Jacky Alcine ===
{{jacky}} uses [https://movim.eu/ movim.eu] since 2021-??-?? for personal use.
In 2022-03-18, he connected it to [https://jmp.chat/ jmp.chat] to allow for bidirectional [[text]] message support

== Service Examples ==
Social-networking applications built on XMPP:
=== Movim ===
* [https://movim.eu Movim]
=== Salut a Toil ===
* [https://salut-a-toi.org/ Salut à Toi] provides a gateway to expose the content on the web, with public access for public content.

== Open source ==
* [https://github.com/legastero/stanza.io stanza.io] 
* [https://github.com/xmpp-ftw/xmpp-ftw XMPP-FTW]

== Standards ==
The core part of XMPP is now an IETF RFC: [http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/rfcs/ RFC-6120].

=== PubSub ===
XMPP has a PubSub protocol for social-networking, as defined in [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#impl-uri XEP 0060].

=== URIs ===
All content throughout the XMPP network has a unique URI. Here's a list of common URI representation of resources:
* user: xmpp:user@host
* PubSub node: xmpp:pubsub.host?;node=nodeName
* PubSub publication: xmpp:pubsub.host?;node=nodeName;item=ae890ac52d0df67ed7cfdf51b644e901

== Issues ==
General issues: 
* massive spec
* no one has ever fully implemented it
* there's no comprehensive (or even feature covering) test suite
* everyone who tries to implement it, only ever implements a subset of it
* interop requires testing with every implementation you want to interoperate with (instead of just with a standard test suite)

* Brainstorming: setup your own site’s XMPP support with an account you could follow that would act as a reader, sending you the notes from folks you follow, and also as publishing client, for posting notes to your site via IM (this is how Twitter XMPP support used to work).
