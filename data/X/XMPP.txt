{{stub}}

'''Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (<dfn>XMPP</dfn>)''' is an open [[messaging]] standard, perhaps best known in its use for cross-platform instant-messaging application interoperability.

The core part of XMPP is now an IETF RFC: [http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/rfcs/ RFC-6120].

Up until recently the XMPP world and the Web world rarely crossed, but now thanks to work on [https://github.com/legastero/stanza.io stanza.io] and [https://github.com/xmpp-ftw/xmpp-ftw XMPP-FTW] you can now "talk" XMPP directly from the web.

== PubSub ==

XMPP has a PubSub protocol for social-networking, as defined in [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#impl-uri XEP 0060].

The two most advanced social-networking applications built on XMPP are [https://movim.eu Movim] and [https://salut-a-toi.org/ Salut Ã  Toi]. Both provide a gateway to expose the content on the web, with public access for public content.

== URIs ==

All content throughout the XMPP network has a unique URI. Here's a list of common URI representation of resources:
* user: xmpp:user@host
* PubSub node: xmpp:pubsub.host?;node=nodeName
* PubSub publication: xmpp:pubsub.host?;node=nodeName;item=ae890ac52d0df67ed7cfdf51b644e901

== Issues ==
General issues: 
* massive spec
* no one has ever fully implemented it
* there's no comprehensive (or even feature covering) test suite
* everyone who tries to implement it, only ever implements a subset of it
* interop requires testing with every implementation you want to interoperate with (instead of just with a standard test suite)
