'''<dfn>XML</dfn>''' is a markup language syntax, similar to SGML, but with draconian error handling that tends to make it fragile in practice.

It is also susceptible to [[security]] vulnerabilities. See the description of the [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml defusedxml] [[Python]] library for a list of attacks.
