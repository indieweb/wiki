'''<dfn>XML</dfn>''' is a markup language syntax, similar to SGML, but with draconian error handling that tends to make it fragile in practice.

== How to not ==
How to not use XML, use HTML instead:
* If you're thinking of building something on/with XML, stop, and consider building on HTML instead. Beyond the obvious example of [[microformats]], this lesson has been (re)learned many times across industries, e.g. 2021-06-26 [https://www.adamhyde.net/one-enormous-step-at-a-time-now-jats/ One Enormous Step at a Time – Now JATS] <blockquote>… start with a HTML-compliant hierarchical structure, and add additional structure and data to it progressively – without needing to know anything about XML.</blockquote>

=== Fragile ===
See numerous cited examples and writeups at:
* https://twitter.com/search?q=%22XML%20is%20fragile%22%20OR%20%22fragile%20XML%22&src=typed_query&f=live

=== Security Vulnerabilities ===
It is also susceptible to [[security]] vulnerabilities. See the description of the [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml defusedxml] [[Python]] library for a list of attacks.

* XML is so hard to parse, Apple upped their amount of parsers from 4 to 6 [https://siguza.github.io/psychicpaper/ to fix a vulnerability].
