{{stub}}

'''<dfn>X-Clacks-Overhead</dfn>''' is an extra HTTP header that can be added as a tribute to the late fantasy author Terry Pratchett. The header name references the [[clacks]], a fictional communications system in his ''Discworld'' novels, and always contains the contents "GNU Terry Pratchett" to ensure that his name lives on, always traversing the internet.

In the fictional context, the "GNU" prefix indicates that a message should be forwarded, not logged, and sent back when it reaches the end of the line, repeating forever. A character in one of the novels is memorialized in this way.
