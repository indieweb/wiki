{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>h-as</dfn>''' was an attempt to explicitly map [[ActivityStreams]] vocabulary 1:1 to [[microformats]], and has been largely abandoned since it somewhat duplicates existing [[h-entry]] functionality, and also encourages explicit post typing which post [[creation]] UIs have largely abandoned in favor of more user-flexible optional properties, and [[post type discovery]] for any consuming code that claims to need explicit types.

== Old Examples ==
* h-as-note
* h-as-article
* h-as-photo
* h-as-checkin
* h-as-reply
* h-as-rsvp
* ... etc.

== Background ==
How did h-as-* happen in the first place? Here's a brief background:

* [[User:Tantek.com]]: One thought is to use [[microformats2]] root class names for object types as we publish them. I've been using "as-note" and "as-article" on my "h-entry" elements for some time (note related 2011 post about "as-*" classnames[https://plus.google.com/+PelleWessman/posts/VSiMYVKgDan]), but as of 13:27, 12 October 2012 (PDT) was considering switching to using '''h-as-note''' and '''h-as-article''' instead (as they're really indicating "subtypes" of an h-entry), and as of [http://tantek.com/2012/302/t2/added-classes-fsws-activitystreams-microformats2 2012-10-26 have done so] per the [[FSWS2012]]  session on ActivityStreams and microformats2[https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/Federated_Social_Web_Summit_2012/notes#as-mf2].

** I'll likely add "h-as-reply" and "h-as-rsvp" as I add those post types. Currently they're just styling hooks, though one could conceivably use them as part of a h-entry -> ActivityStreams(Atom or JSON) converter. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 11:31, 9 May 2013 (PDT)
*** In practice I found no need for "h-as-reply". They're just notes that I can display specially as replies if they happen to have a [[rel-in-reply-to]] link. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 09:03, 25 June 2013 (PDT)
*** I'm leaning towards removing all h-as-* class names as they don't seem to have helped with anything, and less is more. UIs are also moving away from explicit post typing. [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 12:44, 15 March 2015 (PDT)
* [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]]: I am publishing my notes and articles with '''h-as-note''' and '''h-as-article''', as well as using u-as-downstream-duplicate for downstream duplicate URIs ([http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/848/ example]) ----
* [[User:benwerd.com]]: I'm using "h-as-note" and "h-as-article" in [http://idno.co idno], with more to follow. I'm particularly interested in h-as-event in combination with [[webmention]] attendance reports.
* [[User:jeena.net]]: I'm using "h-as-photo" in addition to h-entry for my photo entries.
