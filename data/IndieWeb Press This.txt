'''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-press-this/ IndieWeb Press This]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that extends the [[Press This]] bookmarklet to more easily publish [[reply]], [[like]], [[repost]], and [[RSVP]] posts.

== Usage ==
From the plugin page:
<blockquote>One big IndieWeb raison d’être is using your own web site to [[reply]], [[like]], [[repost]], and [[RSVP]] to posts and events. You do this by annotating links on your site with simple [[microformats|microformats2]] HTML.

Having said that, most people don’t want to write HTML to like or reply to something. WordPress’s Press This bookmarklets can already start a new post with a link to the page you’re currently viewing. This code adds IndieWeb microformats2 markup to that link. Combined with the [[Wordpress_Webmention_Plugin|WordPress Webmention plugin]], you can use this to respond to the current page with just two clicks.

What’s more, if you’re currently on a Facebook post or Twitter tweet, this adds the [[Bridgy Publish]] link that will reply, like, favorite, retweet, or even RSVP inside those social networks.</blockquote>

== Development ==
The development version of the plugin is hosted on [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this Github]. Feel free to file issues or add pull requests there.
