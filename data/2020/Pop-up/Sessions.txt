If you're interested in hosting a pop-up session, feel free to use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

As the session planning/development progresses and you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]] (except '''PLEASE don't use camelCase unless it's a single specific term like "IndieAuth". CamelCase is harder to read and is worse for search indexing/discoverability''')

{{chrisaldrich}} given that the Saturday 10am slot did so well for other the first time, perhaps we keep that and do a date in August or September? Add your preference and we'll try to pick a slot on/around July 13th to give people time to plan.

== IndieWeb Wiki Edit-a-thon ==
=== Details ===
* organizer(s) / facilitators
** {{chrisaldrich}}
** {{addyourself}}
* Date: TBD
* Time: TBD
* There have been some longstanding discussions about revamping various pages on the IndieWeb wiki, so let's have a session to discuss them a bit more in depth and then spend some time reshaping them. Following some initial discussions we might cut-and-paste current pages and then edit them as a group for either replacement or with new pages and redirects from the historical framings. Other ideas for formatting this session are welcome. (See some [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2020-11-19#t1605826468949000 general conversation starting here].
** Required pre-reading: 
*** [[wikify]] — context for what should/should not be on the wiki, and how, meta for all the below
*** [[Main_Page]] — context within which each page should make sense without [[jargon]]
*** [[Getting Started]] — this is the place to send folks or just [[start]] for both a path and branching choices
** [[2019/homepage]] — in-progress work on a new home page design that had fairly good consensus but needs iteration and volunteers to help. Frankly, a higher priority than any other page rewrite (will help the most people the soonest)
** [[IndieMark]] 
** [[Generations]]
** others...

== Prior Hold Overs ==
The sessions below are proposals from [[2020/West|IndieWebCamp West 2020]] which either didn't have facilitators present (generally due to timezone issues) or didn't fit into that schedule. They are archived here for potential future camps or pop-up sessions. We've left the original facilitators, but please feel free to add your name as a pop-up organizer or make notes below each about your specific interest and potential scheduling dates.

=== Offline sites ===
* {{petermolnar}} (facilitator)
* discusion about what offline is, how websites could utilize it, and how we could benefit from it
    ** most static sites could be built to be filesystem/offline available - relative urls, including filenames - is it a good idea? 
    ** Ties in a littlebit with archiving and longevity topic (see Here Today, Gone Tomorrow above)
    ** should we all have simple service workers to make our site available offline? If yes, should it preload the whole site? 
* #offlineweb
* +1 {{t}} - I have some experience here (with offline sites) and would like to understand what to do next


=== JSON-LD to mf2 ===
* {{petermolnar}} (facilitator)
* as monsterous as it sounds, many modern tools are heavily JSON-LD oriented. Would a drop-in JS solution, that turns certain JSON-LD structures into mf/mf2 be useful?
** {{jgmac1106}} JSON-LD gigantic in the edtech world, moving back and forth woruld open up possibilities
* #jsonldisamonster
* +1 {{snarfed}}
* 0 {{gwg}} - neutral as I turn JSON-LD into MF2 (why did you do that to yourself? :) ) To read sites that don't have MF2

=== Motivation: why have a homepage? ===
* {{petermolnar}} (facilitator)
* +1 {{gwg}}
* Ana's post (https://ohhelloana.blog/blogging-and-me/) highlights many problems why people would be afraid of to start blogging, or inclined to stop
* Desirée points out (https://dezz.ie/web-history/letting-go-of-the-old-web/) that getting started from mobile devices is different and may need a different approach, than the Old Ways
* differences between blog vs homepage (if there are any, are there any?)
* How do would you empower people to have a personal, independent web presence?
#emotionalcore
* +1 {{hibs}}
* +1 {{jgmac1106}}
(this could be combined with {{scottgruber}} session...Why have your own web page through lens of quickly building webpage on why having a homepage is important
** this is ~100% the design choice of almost 82% of the people I onboard
*** what decision choice you mean here?
* +1 {{t}}

=== My Uncomplicated IndieWeb WordPress Setup ===
* Joseph Dickson (facilitator)
* How I configured my WordPress site with IndieWeb Plugins at www.LinuxBookPro.com
* IndieWeb Plugins https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/indieweb/
* (Note to Organizer: Lowest Possible Priority - I expect this would last no more than 15 minutes, I haven't prepared.)
* {gwg} wants to see this, as curious. Will struggle to keep comments to minimum.

=== Alternate presentations for Webmentions in comments sections ===
* +1 {{fluffy}}
* +1 {{gwg}} - Want to support this in WP
* +1 [https://www.disquisitioner.com/ David Bryant] -- I can recap my partial implementation on top of Eleventy and point to additional Eleventy + Webmention resources
* +1 {{gRegor}}
* +1 {{t}} -- I like the Arthur C. Clarke definition, and yes Webmention is sufficiently advanced :)

=== Storage & Presentation for Reply Contexts & Link Previews ===
* Facilitator Welcome...
* +1 {{gwg}} Looking to discuss again how you store and display previews to other URLs for reply-contexts and more.
* +1 {{t}} personally still exploring storage for reply-contexts and would like to build on related discussions from IWS 2019

===  Build a web page with HTML and CSS ===
* Scott Gruber (facilitator)
* +1 Greg McVerry 
* A hands on workshop or demo for beginners to feel HTML Energy. We will introduce HTML5 header, nav, main, aside and footer elements to build and style a page with CSS Grid, Flexbox and MultiColumn layout 
* {{t}} - maybe a good "Create Day" session for Sunday?

=== Badges and Gamification ===
* {{jgmac1106}} Facilitator
* I would like to return to discussion about webmention badges as learning tools. Given the recent use of indiemark and indiewebify.me I would like to discuss how we can utilize badges to encourage self assessment and community outreach. In the learning space I want to highlight how webmentions can be used in remote and online learning.

=== Rainbow Bridge to The Future ===
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* How do we use our skills as people who "took the red pill" to connect existing mainstream communities online, and provide support to those exiting the major platforms?
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(    [I suggest "indieweb adoptees" / "participants" / "practicioners"    instead of "people who took the red pill" - Maxwell Joslyn]
* Topics could include:
** AWS and Amazon's announcement of nocode
** Spotify's landgrab
** user-friendly middle ground apps, like Micro.blog (does Ghost qualify?)
** building micro-communities for non-coders
** extra support for POC, LGB..., neurodiverse, and differently-abled 
[this sounds very similar to the Cooking for Others stuff above; maybe merge the two sessions? -- [http://anaulin.org/ Ana Ulin] ]

=== Ethics  ===
* (too late to think of catchy title, maybe tomorrow!)
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* Tracking. Url shorteners. Hit counters. Affiliate income. Accepting fiat money. Perpetuating myths v. surviving with kids. 
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(
* Topics could include:
** Aaron Parecki's mention tonight of how he gives things for free (where will that lead? how does that work for him?)
** tbc
{{maxwelljoslyn}} I don't know what you mean by "perpetuating myths vs surviving with kids", but I would like to know. Also would like to know how fiat money plays into your ideas here. Speaking of money, here are ideas for this session - website to website economy (indie payments anyone?); adding monetization to one's website (and the ethics thereof).

=== State of the Music Industry ===
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* Wtf is happening. 
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(
* Topics could include:
** Derek Sivers' new book on music (he just released yesterday IN HTML!!!)
** can we help birth a new music industry outside of ASCAP/BMI?
** building micro-communities
** See Also
https://indieweb.org/musician
{{maxwelljoslyn}} +1 i am mildly interested, as a total outsider to music industry
+1 to this Own Your Music {{jgmac1106}}
** Quit Spotify and buy an album a month...Feed artists
+1 {{fluffy}} (also bandcamp is the best way to support artists)
+1 [[User%3ATaoetc.org|Beto Dealmeida]] (+1 on bandcamp)
+1 {{gRegor}} (outsider but also interested)

=== Creating a Fund for Next Gen ===
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* My 15 year old, who can't drive or do anything at the moment, learned nocode in 1 day because I offered him $15 to make me a job posting board. To solve my problem of posting multiple POC/women in tech gigs, in 1 place across different communities. The next day, he published what he called a "text game" on Itchio, put it up for sale, and then we discovered he had created a MUD. All with no direct adult assistance. What would it take to foster this for more kids, when their whole world is burning?
* Kai your son is welcome to join us https://tech-4-teens.club starts next week. Here is registration: https://www.cfalct.org/tech4teens
** My 9 year old 7 year old want to come to this session
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(
* Topics could include:
** Raspberry Pi and that whole world (that is beyond me)
** Homebrew Server Club, with solar power
** computer and server building as environmental activism
** teaching of digital minimalism and responsibility of digital waste/bloat
{{maxwelljoslyn}} +1. "Ways to foster self-directed learning". Though, it might be that one good way is to leave the kid alone (within reason) and let them noodle around until they figure it out, as your son did with making a MUD. Another direction could be a tie-in to homeschooling. hey {{jgmac1106}} if you're reading this - you are officially pinged in your capacity as a professor of education :^)
+1 {{petermolnar}} I've veen self-hosting for a long while (including email)

Holdovers from [[2020/East]]
The sessions below are proposals from [[2020/East/Proposals#Unscheduled_sessions_for_future|IndieWebCamp West 2020]] which either didn't have facilitators or facilitators present (generally due to timezone issues) or didn't fit into that schedule. They are archived here for potential future camps or pop-up sessions. We've left the original facilitators, but please feel free to add your name as a pop-up organizer or make notes below each about your specific interest and potential scheduling dates.

=== IndieWeb outside the Web ===
* ... (facilitator)
* Reflections on IndieWeb principles being applied outside the web and with non-digital parts of life.
* Interested in attending:
** +1 {{chaitanya}} 
** +1 Ian
** +1 {{hibs}}
** +1 {{j12t}}

=== Microsub ===
* ... ( facilitator) ?
* Review of open issues and challenges for the spec
** +1 {{angelo}}
** +1 {{raphael}}
** +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}}
** +1 {{omz13}}
** +1 {{gwg}}

=== Salmention as conduit for Vouched Introduction ===
* {{angelo}} (facilitator)
* In this session we'll discuss "introductions" using Salmention as a means for bootstrapping a Vouch.
* #Salintro
** Historically Vouch has been easy to receive (just grab the provided page) and hard to send (the intersection of who do you and I both know and who have I previously communicated). Since only one introduction is necessary, leverage this real-world flow to allowlist transparently.
*** Alice posts something, Bob replies to Alice, Carol replies to Bob. Salmention dictates that Alice should be notified when Bob renders Carol's reply.
*** Bob rendering Carol's reply conveys trust in Carol and is in effect vouching for Carol's reply to be included in Alice's original post. Carol has now been introduced to Alice.
** Some questions we may address:
*** How does Bob's UX alert/facilitate Alice's introduction to Carol?
*** BONUS: /mentions as a mention dump for assisting vouch
*Interested:
** +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}}
** +1 {{gwg}}

=== What Makes an Effective Demo? ===
* {{maxwelljoslyn}} facilitator
* How can one best prepare for a casual 3-minute demo?
** During IndieWeb events, we encourage each other to show off new and evolving work in demos
** This valuable norm gives community members a minimal-risk opportunity to practice public speaking
** It also reinforces our culture of celebrating incremental progress, not just finished projects
* Interested:
** +1 {{sarahdillon}}
** +1 {{gyuri}}
** +1 {{ds}}

=== IndieWeb for Hobbies ===
* facilitator ?
* Using IndieWeb principles for documenting and interacting online for common interests: hobbies, crafts, poetry, etc.
* https://indieweb.org/use_case#IndieWeb_for_hobbies
* Interested
** +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}} There may be some good overlap between this and {{petermolnar}}'s session on real-world data, if the hobby in question involves sensor readings (like plant moisture or homebrewing temperature). Possible merger / joint session? I have some [[poetry]] and translation considerations to offer for discussion, like generating vocabulary cards.
** +1 {{hibs}}
** +1 {{chrisaldrich}}

=== Moz Fest Proposals ===
* Moz Fest is coming up in 2021 and it might be interesting to submit an IndieWeb related session (or two).
* https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/get-involved/proposals/
* If not a full session on Saturday, perhaps this might make a good hack day project on Sunday for some.
* +1 Ian Forrester

=== unusual POSSE destinations and PESOS sources ===
* {{petermolnar}} (facilitator)
Apart from the "common" POSSE/PESOS systems - twitter, mastodon, etc - there are countless potentials out there - SSBC, Telegram Channels, long forgotten newsgroups, mailing lists, etc. 
Is anyone connecting their content to systems like these? If so, how, and, more importantly, why? 
#whimsicalPOSSE
* Interested:
**  +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}}
** +1{{gyuri}}
** +1 {{Jaenis.ch}}
** +1 {{gwg}}

=== Do You Want To Learn PHP? ===
* We can't learn it all in one day but maybe we can get a crew together who want to learn together amd outloud as we blog about what we learn
* I can't teach you. I know next to nothing but 
* {{jgmac1106}} facilitator
* jaenis.ch: Is it limited to PHP? Or can it involve other programming languages as well? Perhaps worth looking into what picking up programming can bring you? neat idea but happy to cut session since just two of us
 
=== Social networking with the IndieWeb and Fediverse? ===
* Ian Forrester (facilitator)
* In this session, I would like to really get a clear idea of how they link and work together
** We'll also discuss together ActivityPub, The Fediverse,  This graphic - https://indieweb.org/graphics
** even if this doesn't become a session, you may want to take a look at https://fed.brid.gy/ +1 (jaenis.ch)
+1 hamishcampbell
+1 {{gyuri}}
+1 {{kevinmarks}} there has been some degree of decay here as mastodon dropped the WebSub support it started with, but the microformats and rel-me support there is good
