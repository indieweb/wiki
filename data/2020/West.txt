== Brainstorming ==

The largest online IWC in scope was IWC Online 2019, which had 11 sessions and 20 active participants. This event attempted to adopt a multi-timezone schedule. This event will be centered in the Pacific timezone, but we have to be aware of how adjusting the schedule can be more inclusive to people who live in other timezones.

=== Session Planning ===

The biggest challenge of session planning for an online IWC is that the casual pre-event conversations that often prompt sessions later do not take place in this medium. We have tried traditional barcamp session planning, and advance session proposals. May suggest a mix this time. Goal can be that at least 50% of our sessions are proposed in advance.

=== Social Activities ===

Physical IWCs usually include a pre-event dinner the night before, shared breakfast/lunch at the event, and often dinner after the event. How can we add a social component to the event?
* RPG room
* Animal Crossing or Mariokart tournament?
* Karaoke (we did it at OER20)

How about a Zoom lunch?

=== Demos ===

Split demo session...early and late...to cover different timezones, but not split session days.

=== Simultaneous Rooms ===

The online IWCs often have a single track, whereas in-person ones often have multiple rooms. What do we want to aim for in terms of this?
* we have always pallned for multiple track online but the demand wasn't there. Plan for multiple tracks but know you may go down to one. 
* Every session needs
  * Facilitator
  * Host (sets up tech runs the room, should not be facilitator or scribe)
  * Scribe

=== Hallway Track ===

Do we want to try something like this?

=== Zoom ===

The technology of choice recently for IWC has been Zoom. Assuming we continue in this way, do we want to take advantage of breakout rooms and other Zoom features? How do we adjust the way sessions work for this medium?
