== Session Proposals ==
{{main|2020/West/Proposals}}

Much like in-person IndieWebCamps, we are following a Bar Camp style format. To facilitate the process and because the camp is entirely online, we're already beginning to accept session ideas and proposals ahead of camp. Camps are interesting because of what participants bring to them, so '''all attendees are encouraged (but not required) to present or facilitate a session or otherwise contribute to the event'''. This doesn't mean you need to be an expert on the topic you're interested in--far from it! Sessions on concepts that have never been done before are frequently proposed and this is how we break new ground.

Time for session brainstorming and scheduling will be set aside on the day of the event so that people can think about what they'd like to share, learn, and discuss for the balance of the day. However, if you have time before camp feel free to sketch out your ideas in the Etherpad for session proposals.
