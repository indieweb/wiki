<span class="p-summary">Welcome to the planning page for <dfn>[[2020|IndieWeb Summit 2020]]</dfn>.</span>

== Organizers ==
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{t}}

== Volunteers ==
Summit succeeds thanks to volunteers helping out with all sorts of things.
* {{addyourself}} - and what roles you're available/prefer to help with!

=== Volunteer roles ===
A few of the volunteer roles folks helped out with in [[2019]]:
* checking / signing people in
* handling t-shirts
* letting people in from downstairs and up the elevators (need Mozilla folks for this)
* making (and playing) a music playlist for the mornings (from doors open to first talks)
* taking (and posting) photos
* facilitating pre-planned hackday sessions (IndieWeb 101, IndieWebifying your WordPress, IndieWeb Building Blocks)

Some roles we identified that we needed:
* volunteer coordinator (or possibly an organizer role if we get enough)
* intros queue handling (making sure people are ready for their turn to show their site, cued up on the demo laptop or ready with an adapter)
* hack demos queue handling (same)

Some roles that could help:
* day 1 lunch coordinators (could help to have a few volunteers to reach out to especially shy folks to see if they want to be included in a group of people for lunch)

== Things ==
We've started collecting key things here for Summit 2020, starting with a simple list (unordered, unprioritized)

----
* {{t}} check into alternatives for letting people into the building and up the elevators (in [[2019]] we had to have Mozilla employees do this due to rules about building badges)
** option: pay for a weekend building security guard to do this
** option: can we get the 3rd floor elevator unlocked from 8:45am-10:15am?
----
* Higher participation ceiling? 60? 75? 100?
** We had 51/60 participants in [[2019]] and it felt like we could have accommodated at least a few more. With planning (room capacity etc.) we may be able to accommodate much more, perhaps up to 100.
** What are the factors we need to account for, to handle more people?
*** main room seating (possibly use combined BC rooms as overflow seating for ~15-20 more)
*** bathroom supplies (more toilet paper stocking)
*** food ordering and queues
*** session planning (more people will likely mean more proposals)
*** demo queue handling for minimum downtime
*** demo max time to allow for more people (maybe 60s? 90s hard cut-off?)
*** room temperature and circulation, [[2019]] was just about ok (barely not too warm). with many more people we may need fans and or HVAC set to a lower baseline
*** pre-party: start earlier (17:00) and start saving tables (organizers + volunteers) at 16:30?
*** after party? Karaoke - book 2 rooms?

We'll restructure and add sections as needed.
