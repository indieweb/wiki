== Volunteers ==
Summit succeeds thanks to volunteers helping out with all sorts of things.
* {{addyourself}} - and what roles you're available/prefer to help with!

=== Volunteer roles ===
A few of the volunteer roles folks helped out with in [[2019]]:
* checking / signing people in
* handling t-shirts
* letting people in from downstairs and up the elevators (need Mozilla folks for this)
* making (and playing) a music playlist for the mornings (from doors open to first talks)
* taking (and posting) photos
* facilitating pre-planned hackday sessions (IndieWeb 101, IndieWebifying your WordPress, IndieWeb Building Blocks)

Some roles we identified that we needed:
* volunteer coordinator (or possibly an organizer role if we get enough)
* intros queue handling (making sure people are ready for their turn to show their site, cued up on the demo laptop or ready with an adapter)
* hack demos queue handling (same)

== Things ==
We've started collecting key things here for Summit 2020, starting with a simple list (unordered, unprioritized)

* {{t}} check into alternatives for letting people into the building and up the elevators (in [[2019]] we had to have Mozilla employees do this due to rules about building badges)
** option: pay for a weekend building security guard to do this
** option: can we get the 3rd floor elevator unlocked from 8:45am-10:15am?
* ...

We'll restructure and add sections as needed.
