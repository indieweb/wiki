==== Pre-camp introduction ====

** Join this pre-session on Tuesday, November 10th from 8-9 pm Eastern at https://events.indieweb.org/2020/11/indiewebcamp-east-2020-pre-camp-preparation-r3EbFzvmkAhv

==== Friday Pre-Party ====
* Details pending
<!-- The night before camp from 20:00 to 22:00, we're continuing our tradition of a pre-camp dinner...except we will be eating together apart. So, set a place setting in front of your webcam and join us for some distance socializing. In respect to other timezones, you need not bring dinner. Other meals, snacks, drinks, etc are welcome. We will set up some Zoom break out rooms for people to pop into for some conversations.

<br>'''Day 2''' is about creating or making things for our websites! Direct your inspiration from what we discussed on day 1 into something on your site. Collaborate with others or work on your own. We'll have [[2020/East/Demos|demos]] at the end of the day to see what everyone worked on!

* Never attended a camp before? See '''[[IndieWebCamps/Attendance|Attending IndieWebCamp]]''' for what to expect and maybe do some pre-camp set up to make your real time attendance less stressful. (See the Pre-Event section above for a possible online walk through to familiarize yourself with our tools, ask questions and get ready before the day of camp.)

More details and links for remote participation will be posted here on the days of the event.

=== Remote Participation ===

* [https://indieweb.org wiki] All session grids and schedules will be listed here
* [[Etherpad]] - All sessions will have an etherpad for organization, live note taking, and brainstorming on the day of the event. These will eventually be archived to the wiki
* [[discuss|IndieWeb chat]] - there are a variety of methods/ways to [[discuss|access the various chat channels on the wiki]].
* Audio/Video - recordings of all sessions will be placed on archive.org for individuals who did not participate to watch after-the-fact.

<!-- If you can't get to the event, consider remote participating or finding/running an IndieWebCamp remote party near you. -->


== Session Proposals ==
{{main|2020/East/Proposals}}

Much like in-person IndieWebCamps, we are following a Bar Camp style format. To facilitate the process and because the camp is entirely online, we're already beginning to accept session ideas and proposals ahead of camp.

Camps are interesting because of what participants bring to them, so '''all attendees are encouraged (but not required) to present or facilitate a session or otherwise contribute to the event'''. This doesn't mean you need to be an expert on the topic you're interested in--far from it! Sessions on concepts that have never been done before are frequently proposed and this is how we break new ground.

Time for session brainstorming and scheduling will be set aside on the day of the event so that people can think about what they'd like to share, learn, and discuss for the balance of the day. However, if you have time before camp feel free to sketch out your ideas in the Etherpad for session proposals.

[[Etherpad]] for Session Proposals: https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2020-East-Sessions
