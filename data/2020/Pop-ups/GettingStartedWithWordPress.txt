IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2020<br>
Session: Getting Started with WordPress<br>
When: 2020-08-01 9:30 AM (Pacific) / 12:30 PM (Eastern)

This will be a broad-based introduction to the IndieWeb session specifically focused on using [[WordPress]]. Our aim is to help people get set up and running a self-hosted IndieWeb-based website with WordPress though some of our discussion will work for WordPress.com versions as well. 

* Grab a cup of coffee and get an IndieWeb site up and running in just a few hours. 
* Have questions or problems with your current WordPress IndieWeb site? Stop by and get some help.
* Just figuring out what IndieWeb is about? Much of what we'll discuss is applicable to other platforms and may be useful to other beginners as well.
