This session will be to iterate on proposed extensions to Micropub, listed on the the [[Micropub-extensions]] page. We will discuss which extensions can be moved to stable, try to better define those proposed, and to see who is willing to implement what proposal.

If possible, attendees should familiarize themselves with existing open issues.

* {{barryf}} - builder of micropublish.net
* {{manton}} - builder of [[micro.blog]]
* {{craftyphotons}} - new to IndieWeb, building a MicroPub server to publish my Hugo site is one of my next projects
* [[User:Omz13.com|David Somers]]
* {{jamietanna}} building his own client that will reflect server's capabilities automagically
* {{carolgilabert}} (mostly listening too :))
* {{hirusi}} (mostly listening) building a micropub client, soon to open source
* {{chrisaldrich}}
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{t}}
* ... add names


== Notes ==


* forking the spec to github.com/indieweb and its living specification URL to micropub.spec.indieweb.org
** {{t}} pointed out as {{aaronpk}} is the spec editor and wrote the text, he can relicense it with attribution.
* The search modifier for stable extension, Query for Category/Tag List The search modifier would search for categories for an auto-complete. 
** https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/5 is the stable extension for querying category/tag
** intended use is autocomplete. other things to autocomplete are nicknames for @-mentions
** https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/34
** {{gwg}} will modify his code to match this, as will {{manton}} and {{barryf}}
* Modifiers for stable extension, Query for Post List. q=source is now stable, but the filters: query, limit, before, after, order, exists, not-exists, etc are still in need of further discussion.
** https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/4
** https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/35 - Limit as a parameter for limiting all return queries. How it behaves/chooses will vary based on endpoint decisions.
** Offset vs before/after
** {{gwg}} willl support offset
** {{jackyalcine}} supports before/after [chronological pagination] and not offset [sequential pagination]
** {{manton}} supports limit and offset already
** [[post-status]] - Show only drafts or published. 
*** {{gwg}} will commit to supporting this
*** {{jackyalcine}} supports this in {{Koype/Publish}} and {{Lwa}} but will not support in {{Lighthouse}}
*** {{aaronpk}} will support this
*** {{barryf}} will commit to support this
*** {{manton} will support this
** visibility - public, unlisted, private
*** {{gwg}} will commit to support this
*** {{jackyalcine}} will work on supporting this in {{Koype/Publish}}, {{Lighthouse}} and {{Lwa}}
*** {{barryf}} will commit to support this
** Any microformats properties would go in as a theoretical property query, but anything such as status or visibility would be their own query.
*** properties[key]=value - Tabled for further discussion
*** post-type  - querying for post types as defined by PTD. - Further discussiion needed, issue needs to be opened.
* Draft Scope - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/24
** Trust / Privacy
*** This could also be a useful feature for location-based apps to ensure privacy
*** Making sure one trusts an app before they have the ability to publish directly.
** Also good for initial posts to make sure the UI and details are done correctly. 
**{{chrisaldrich}} noticed some odd formatting issues with respect to his theme when posting via ThreadReaderApp initially; draft would have mitigated this
** iA Writer did this voluntarily; they set the status as draft as default
** {{gwg}} already implements this
** {{aaronpk}} will be implementing this
** {{jackyalcine}} will look into this at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/212

* Link Rel for Media Endpoint - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/15
** {{manton}} -1
** {{jackyalcine}} -1 `q=config` handles this well
** Consensus is not yet a compelling reason to add this complexity
* Standalone Pages - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/25
** Proposal includes / in the mp-slug other h=page.
** {{jackyalcine}} to drop `h-x-page` in favor for `h-page`
** {{jackyalcine}} will confirm if the Elixir IndieWeb library supports PTD for pages
** Using h=page seems to be the most straightforward approach.
***  {{gwg}} will commit to supporting this in WordPress and will decide about whether to mark up the page with h-page later
*** {{aaronpk}} to implement as wel
*** {{manton}} will implement this too (dropping the x- I'm currently using)
**** {{manton}} will also add h-page to manton.org before rolling it out to all of Micro.blog
** How to handle page heirarchies - parent/child
** Define h-page on MF wiki, add PTD to add page to the algorithm, define ?q=source&post-type=* as querying all types defined by post type discovery
** Add to indieweb.org/page examples of people using pages.
** Prior art / references:
***  https://microformats.org/wiki/page
***  https://indieweb.org/page
* Add Checked Property to Syndication Target - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/23, Needs Implementations.
** {{jacky}}, {{gwg}} and {{aaronpk}}, {{barryf}} to implement
** {{jacky}} tracking progress at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/213
**  Clients would have to change behavior to offer this. Some may be caching this only once.
**  Second idea, when querying for targets, add `post-type` to allow for customized targets based on context. Possibly add url later.  https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/23#issuecomment-663887155
* Location Checkin Information - Overloading geo URI https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/32
* Response from Media Endpoint - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/13
** {{gwg}} and {{jackyalcine}} will implement a minimal form of this
** {{manton}} will update response from upload to include JSON
*** Minimum URL
*** Optional Width + Height, Mime-type, children for alternative size files - Mirror EXIF vocabulary?
* Query for Media from Endpoint - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/14
** q=last is superseded by q=source
** {{aaronpk}} will add q=source to his website and drop from Quill in favor of q=source&limit=1
** {{manton}} already supports this, going to remove properties except url
** Same as response, except item property with list of response styles from above
* Query for Location/Venue - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/6
** h-adr geo, h-card venue
** Documenting other systems that have this feature...screenshots...data used
*** Microformats displayed for location
*** Document tagging posts plus checkin as user cases for this
* Deleting uploaded media - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/30
** Should require delete + media scope
** action=delete to mirror Micropub endpoint syntax
** {{manton} will support this

* Configuration Queries - Tabled and not discussed
** Query for Supported/Unsupported Properties - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/8, https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/21
** Query for Supported Queries - https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/7
** Query for supported properties, for a supported post-type https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/33

== Additional ideas for discussion ==
* Copy update - clear up possibly confusing paragraph around media endpoint - https://github.com/w3c/Micropub/issues/118
* Content-negotiation for Browser-driven interactions to Micropub endpoints https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/28
