__TOC__

== Details ==
=== Description ===
The IndieWeb WordPress community could use some more theme options. Let's get together as a community and host a Theme raising (a play on the idea of the old [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising Barn raising]). We can all work/hack together to make some of the popular WordPress themes more [[friendly|IndieWeb friendly]]. We'll discuss methods for adding the necessary [[Microformats]] and best ways to indieweb-ify a WordPress theme. Either bring your own favorite theme or work from one on a list. All levels are welcome! (We'll try to help newcomers learn to begin tinkering with some WordPress theme code. If you don't have a [[GitHub]] account yet, you might create one beforehand and we'll show you how to use it for development, but even without it you can still do a lot with just a text editor.)

This will be a workshop/hack session where we'll discuss the problems and issues related to WordPress and Microformats. '''Beginners and those without coding experience are welcome/encouraged to attend.
