Let's discuss how can we iterate IndieAuth? What open issues are there to discuss on the issue tracker? What OAuth proposals might be worth implementing in IndieAuth endpoints? Should PKCE be mandatory? More thoughts captured in the [https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/milestone/1 IndieAuth 1.1 milestone] on GitHub.

If possible, attendees should familiarize themselves with existing open issues.
