=== Agenda ===

Let's discuss how we can close out some outstanding microformats2 questions. Come with a few items from the list to discuss.
* https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/
* https://github.com/microformats/h-card/issues
* https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues
* https://github.com/microformats/h-feed/issues
* https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues

==== Parsing ====
microformats2 features are advanced by a 3 step process: Proposed, Draft, and Stable. 

* Proposed features must provide documentation of what specific real world use-cases they are solving, preferably with a link to a step-by-step user scenario.
* Draft properties must in addition be published and consumed in the wild on the public web, demonstrate solving the use case for which they were proposed, and should provide citations of real world public web sites publishing and (other sites) consuming them, interoperably.
* Stable properties must in addition be published and consumed in the wild on multiple sites by multiple implementations (3+ different sites and implementations for publishing and consuming). When a draft property reaches a critical mass of deployment by numerous sites and implementations (far beyond 3+), due to network effects and backward compatibility considerations it effectively becomes stable, since it becomes increasingly difficult to change it in any way and have so many sites and implementations also change.

We have several properties that could advance levels.

* Parse Language Information - https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/3
* Should U-parsing Special Case srcset  - https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/7
* Consider not including alt-text as part of surrounding text properties https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/16
* URLs with Fragments should only have the node identified by the fragment  and its descendents parsed https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/46
* Should we specify a mime-type for parsed mf2 json https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/52
