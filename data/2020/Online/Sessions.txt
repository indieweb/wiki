==== Collections and You ====
* Organizer: {{maxwelljoslyn}}
* Description: Roughly, collections are lists of posts, or links thereto, arranged in a desired order. What types of post are better served by a collection than a typical chronological feed? Does the intentionality of ordering one's collection suggest collection-specific posting flows, interface mechanisms, or UI details for site visitors?
