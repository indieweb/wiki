== Travel and Lodging ==

=== Trains ===
The London Underground (people call it "tube" here) network in London is usually the most cost effective and reliable form of transport within Central London. We recommended doing a [https://goo.gl/maps/gCvSqkxHS9ybEvbM7 Google Map] or [https://citymapper.com/london City Mapper] search before travel on the day in case of late notice engineering works. 

🚃 The closest step-free National Rail / London Underground station is '''Liverpool Street'''
(National Rail, Metropolitan, Hammersmith and City, Circle and Central Line, Overground, TfL Rail), approximately 15 minutes from the venue. 

🚃 Other stations close to the venue include '''Old Street''' and '''Moorgate''' on the Northern Line and Great Northern. There are also several bus stops within a one or two-block radius.

🚧 ''TfL Rail and National Rail are suspended over the weekend between '''Liverpool Street''' and '''Shenfield''' with longer alternatives via replacement bus and London Underground''

Registered service animals are welcome on all London trains, buses and the London Underground.

Fees vary according to zones, the venue is located in zone 1. Get an Oyster card or use a contactless debit or credit card so you can have a daily cap on your fees. Alternatively visitors by train from outside London may find it cheaper to purchase a one-day Travelcard combined with their train ticket.

There are also buses running throughout London. This is a good way to travel to take in London's landmarks (if it goes past any). It's also very cost effective to travel on buses at just £1.50 per journey (including interchange within an hour).

'''For more information about routes, etc:'''
* 🚃 [https://traintimes.org.uk/ Accessible UK Train Timetables]
* 🚈 [https://tfl.gov.uk/plan-a-journey/ Transport For London (TFL): Plan A Journey] for London Underground status and trip planning

=== Eurostar ===
🚄 Several European cities are connected to '''London St Pancras''' in Central London by Eurostar directly including Paris, Brussels, Lille, Rotterdam and Amsterdam. [https://www.eurostar.com Book in advance] for cheaper fares than flying. Consider this option for a lower carbon footprint when traveling from Central Europe.

=== Airports ===
There are 6 airports serving London (Heathrow, City, Stansted, Luton, Gatwick, Southend), most of them are not in Greater London but have a reasonable connection to downtown London by train or coach (e.g. National Express). We don't recommend flying to and from Southend due to distance and scheduled engineering works. Trains to the airports can cost up to £18, please check before you budget for your travel.

=== Coaches ===
By coach there are two popular nationwide companies including [https://www.nationalexpress.com/en National Express] and [https://uk.megabus.com/ Megabus]. Some of these stop close to the venue at '''Liverpool Street''' whilst most will terminate at the main coach station '''Victoria'''.

=== Uber ===
🚙 They operate in London

=== Taxi ===
🚕 Cabs

=== Cycling ===
You can find to hire bikes everywhere. People have different opinions about cycling in the streets in London, it depends on your skill level. Please decide for yourself and plan your route in advance.

🚲 There are several National Cycle Routes near to the venue. Bicycle parking is located outside the venue. [https://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/ Plan your cycle route] on CycleStreets.

If you bring your own bike, make sure you lock it well. There is no indoor parking at the venue.

=== Parking ===
There is no parking at the venue itself, but there are several car parks within a short walk. Car parking costs range from approximately £25 to £80 per day depending on the car park used. Also, note that the office is within the London congestion charge area and Ultra Low Emissions Zone. There is no Congestion charge on weekends.

=== Hotels ===
🏫 Staying in central London (Zone 1) is not going to be cheap, you can consider staying in Zone 2-3. They are usually cheaper and traveling to them by public transport is normally straightforward. Consider the Docklands area (East London) where there are DLR trains through to Bank station, within walking distance.

There are clusters of cheaper hotels near King's Cross/Russell Square (near where Eurostar terminates) and Paddington/Bayswater (near where the Heathrow Express train terminates) - both of these areas are handy for the Underground or rental cycling.

* {{danq}} is staying at the London Walthamstow Travelodge, which has "early bird" rooms from £65.99 and is about 15 minutes train ride from Liverpool Street Station '''(we're "remote only" now and he can't cancel it; anybody who has a use for a free hotel room in London on Saturday can have it)'''
* {{jamietanna}} is staying in the Travelodge near Old Street, which was £140 at the time of booking for Friday and Saturday nights. '''(we're "remote only" now and he can't cancel it; anybody who has a use for a free hotel room in London on Saturday can have it)'''

=== Roomsharing ===
* Put your roomsharing offers here.

== Places to grab lunch ==

Places that offer "grab and go" options that you can take anywhere. These are also usually cheaper. 

* [https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/find-a-pret/EC1Y%201HQ Pret A Manger] Unit 1, Oliver's Yard, City Road, London, United Kingdom EC1Y 1HQ
* Subway: 6 City Road, London, EN EC1Y 2AA, GBR

* [https://www.pattyandbun.co.uk/locations/liverpool-st Patty & Bun] 22-24 Liverpool St, London EC2M 7PD

The "Broadgate Circle" area will have some restaurants as well. These will likely be more expensive and usually sit down meals. Here are some recommendations of places that are more in the middle range of prices:
