<span class="p-summary">The [[2020|IndieWeb Summit 2020]] organizers are looking at all the information we have about COVID-19, have frozen Summit registration, and are figuring out how and when to postpone the Summit.</span>

The venue (Mozilla Portland) is currently closed and we don't know when it will be reopened.

We have frozen Summit registrations while we figure out how and when to postpone the Summit which we still very much would like to host and organize in-person.

We may also organize (separately) an Online IndieWebCamp West Coast during June 27-28 weekend.

Stay tuned and keep up to date on https://chat.indieweb.org/meta
