    - ✅ start building in module mode

    - ✅ copy modules with local modifications, use local replace directives as a first step

    - ✅ get tests to pass (proof = https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1924134/103141648-3795d500-46c5-11eb-8e8f-096de1f89131.png )

    - ✅ update various uses of importPathToDir helper to be compatible with module mode

    - [for another day] fix use of vfsgendev to be compatible with module mode, so that go generate works

    - [later] clean up and upstream local graphql patches

    - ✅ port few remaining pages to WebAssembly; remove dependency on GopherJS (because it only supports Go 1.11, but I need 1.16 for darwin/arm64 support)

    - ✅ make a copy of database data for local testing

    - ✅ make deployment credentials available


* {{astralbijection}} GMT-8
** Adding wordpress-style commenting to https://astrid.tech
    - Markdown formatting with HTML cleaning. No injecting <script> tags for you >:(
    - Wrote tests for the backend
    - Made the frontend submit comments to the backend
    - Implemented '''oppressive moderator censorship options''' such as removing comments and locking threads
    - Added form validation

* {{sknebel}}

*{{chrisaldrich}} GMT-8
** Taking care of some admin tax and updating various pieces of site
** Post Kinds plugin update and template work

* {{maxwelljoslyn}} GMT-8
** caught up on version control, for both site code and material, with sloppy and irresponsibly large Git commits
** sent out the 5th set of interview questions for The Drongo (https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/thedrongo)
** wikified my https://mxjn.me URL shortener (oh-so-basic but the simplest use case is also the one I needed most)
todo:
    fix bug in default me-only audience implementation for private posts
    experiment with CSS Grid of "cards" to better showcase The Drongo interviewees
    work on my master's degree essays - hosted on my website as private posts ;)

* {{sebsel}} GMT+1 but acting GMT-something
** server maintenance (aren't we all)
