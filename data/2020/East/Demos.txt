=== Ian Forrester ===
* (via chat as he's in the UK)
* Last night I moved my gratitude diary from wordpress.com and moved it to my Raspberry PI with Yunohost. - https://gratitude.cubicgarden.info/blog/
* Like to have a play with kinds to make each diary entry a little different depending on my gratitude. 
** Also like this to transfer into the RSS feed, so I can do something different here - https://cubicgarden.com/gratitude-diary/ (pulls from the RSS feed)
* Also tried to install WriteFreely instead of WP but didn't seem to install. Like to make writing the gratitude s a bit quicker, so looking at the email to WP thing
* I always write my gratitude diary late at night and when I was around my partners flat, didn't want to get the chromebook out to post for a short while. WP is quicker but feels heavy for something so small and quick
* I enabled micropub on wp; I enabled indieauth
* https://gratitude.cubicgarden.info/blog/2020/11/15/307/ - via webauth & micropub

=== Jeremy Felt ===
* Finished a blog post https://jeremyfelt.com/2020/11/15/notes-on-indie-web-camp-east-online-2020-day-1/
* Published an in-progress home page
* Created a microformat-blocks project for [[WordPress]] https://github.com/jeremyfelt/microformat-blocks
* Started implementing [[h-entry]] / e-content through [[Gutenberg]] blocks

=== {{jackjamieson}} === 
* Finished formatting my IndieWeb-focused dissertation as a webpage: http://dissertation.jackjamieson.net
* Wrote a quick blog post about it - https://jackjamieson.net/dissertation-available/

=== Sarah Hibner ===
* {{hibs}} Updated 'Intro to Variable Fonts' to include learning resources: http://outer-outer.space/intro-to-variable-fonts 
* Added [[variable fonts]] page to wiki: https://indieweb.org/variable_fonts 
* Added 'Intro to Variable Fonts' [[portfolio]] item to http://sarah-hibner.com/ 

=== Simon Willison ===
* datasette-indieauth plugin
* Datasette https://datasette.io/ can be extended with authentication plugins. I decided to write one for IndieAuth.
* Plugin homepage: https://github.com/simonw/datasette-indieauth
* Demo here: https://datasette-indieauth-demo.vercel.app/-/indieauth
* It can also be configured to ONLY allow access to the Datasette instance for a specific allow-list of user IDs. This demo only allows access to simonwillison.net https://datasette-indieauth-demo-j7hipcg4aq-uc.a.run.app/
* Here's the command I ran to deploy that demo:
 datasette publish cloudrun ../datasette/fixtures.db \
    --service datasette-indieauth-demo \
    --install datasette-indieauth \
    --plugin-secret datasette-indieauth restrict_access https://simonwillison.net/

* So now I can publish a database file to the internet and restrict access to a specific allow-list of [[IndieAuth]] user IDs using a single terminal command.

=== Andr√© Jaenisch ===
* Redoing my website ([[Eleventy]] + [[Nunjucks]] Template Language) while designing it with [[Storybook]]
