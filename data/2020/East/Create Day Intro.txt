=== (Potential) Serverless Indieweb options ===
* Participants
** raphael

* My existing architecture is an S3 bucket full of static files, with a little swarm of functions that listen for events to keep them up-to-date. By using the infrastructure description language Terraform, I'm able to build collections of specialized infrastructure that can easily be deployed and managed as a unit. One of my next challenges is to build a webmention receiver endpoint and to migrate my build process from Hugo to a web function. I'm using AWS, but I'm more interested in talking about the architecture in a vendor-agnostic way

=== (Potential) User Outreach Strategies===
* Participants
** raphael

* A thought experiment: if we somehow already had every piece of indieweb technology finished, and the onboarding process took only one click, would that be enough to get most people to migrate out of silos? If not, how can we give  the human elements of social media as much focus as we give the technical elements? 

=== WordPress Themes === 
* Fixing up Post Kinds Templates to work with micropub on personal site; Drafts App actions for QT. Look at mf2 plugin.  
* Participants
** miklb 
 
=== Jekyll IndieWeb  ===
* Depedency updates, look at accessibility issues.  
* Participants ==
