* [https://events.indieweb.org/2020/06/indiewebcamp-west-eat-your-own-cooking-pre-party-DH5F8SRjSHff Get the Zoom link]

The night before camp, we're continuing our tradition of a pre-camp dinner...except we will be eating together apart. So, set a place setting in front of your webcam and join us for some distance socializing. In respect to other timezones, you need not bring dinner. Other meals, snacks, drinks, etc. are welcome. We will set up some Zoom break out rooms for people to pop into for some conversations.

=== Lunch Topics ===
Since we're all remote, we thought folks might like to break into smaller groups (or Zoom rooms) to chat about particular topics, ideas, CMSes, platforms, etc. Below, feel free to propose lunch topics and add your name underneath and we can break people into groups for the mid-day meal break.
* Topic 1
** {{addyourself}}


=== Evening Activities ===
Feel free to self-organize evening dinner and activities during or after dinner here! Add yourself to an existing activity, or add a new activity!
* ðŸ‘¾ðŸ•¹ Games (got a suggestion?)
** {{addyourself}}
* ðŸŽ¶ TBD music (got a suggestion? Is Zoom Karaoke a doable thing?)
** {{addyourself}}
* Evening Meetups
* ... add more ideas here if you want to lead something!
