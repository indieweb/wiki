The '''<dfn>[[2020/East|IndieWebCamp 2020 East]] schedule and session grid</dfn>''' is where notes and videos from all sessions can be found.

The session grid is developed on day 1, and is based on suggestions by the attendees.

All times are <strong>local</strong> (Eastern Time Zone) times. If you are a remote attendee, make sure to [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20201114T170000&p1=137&p2=179&p3=136&p4=195&p5=37&p6=141&p7=215&p8=176&p9=47&p10=196&p11=248 convert to your timezone].

* On [https://events.indieweb.org/2020/11/indiewebcamp-east-eat-your-own-cooking-pre-party-MqlaRlMv0XIh Friday, November 13 from 20:00-22:00] EST Eat Your Own Cooking Pre-Party

* [https://events.indieweb.org/2020/11/indiewebcamp-east-eat-your-own-cooking-pre-party-MqlaRlMv0XIh Get the Zoom link]

The night before camp, we're continuing our tradition of a pre-camp dinner...except we will be eating together apart. So, set a place setting in front of your webcam and join us for some distance socializing. In respect to other timezones, you need not bring dinner. Other meals, snacks, drinks, etc. are welcome. We will set up some Zoom break out rooms for people to pop into for some conversations.

* Topic 1
** {{addyourself}}


=== Evening Activities ===
Feel free to self-organize evening dinner and activities during or after dinner here! Add yourself to an existing activity, or add a new activity!
* ðŸ‘¾ðŸ•¹ Games (got a suggestion?)

** {{addyourself}}
* Evening Meetups
