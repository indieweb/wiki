'''<dfn>Session Proposals for 2020 East</dfn>''' is a part of [[2020/East|IndieWeb Camp 2020 East]] with instructions on how to propose sessions for the Camp in November 2020.

== Session Proposals ==
* The session proposal etherpad for [[2020/East]] is at https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2020-East-Sessions<!-- and has been archived on this page (below) on 2020-TK-TK-->. Please post your session proposals there. We will schedule them on the morning of the first day of camp.

* First time proposing a session? More details for proposing a session for IndieWebCamp can be found at: https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attending#Session_Scheduling

Session proposals typically contain the following:

# A descriptive title
# A facilitator name for a session (almost always the person proposing the session)
# A longer description about what might be discussed, brainstormed, or researched during a particular session
# A unique short hashtag that will be used to create an etherpad and other possible related resources for a session

Optionally, you can include some additional notes, information, links, examples, that might be imported into the session or that potential attendees could read and think about prior to the session.

<!-- Copy and paste this template to add session
=== Example Proposal ===
* Sue Rogationem (facilitator)
* In this sample session, we'll discuss and brainstorm ideas about how to make IndieWebCamp sessions easier to propose.
** We'll also discuss A, B, C
** Some questions we might address:
    *** Question 1
    *** Question 2
    *** Question 3
* #ExampleSession -->

<!--
=== Hold Over for a Future Camp ===
* The sessions below either didn't have facilitators present or didn't fit into the schedule. We can archive them for future sessions, camps, or pop-up sessions
* A copy of these can also be found at [[2020/Pop-up/Sessions]] for future convenience

==== Offline sites ====
* {{petermolnar}} (facilitator)
* discusion about what offline is, how websites could utilize it, and how we could benefit from it
** most static sites could be built to be filesystem/offline available - relative urls, including filenames - is it a good idea? 
** Ties in a littlebit with archiving and longevity topic (see Here Today, Gone Tomorrow above)
** should we all have simple service workers to make our site available offline? If yes, should it preload the whole site? 
* #offlineweb
* +1 {{t}} - I have some experience here (with offline sites) and would like to understand what to do next


==== JSON-LD to mf2 ====
* {{petermolnar}} (facilitator)
* as monsterous as it sounds, many modern tools are heavily JSON-LD oriented. Would a drop-in JS solution, that turns certain JSON-LD structures into mf/mf2 be useful?
** {{jgmac1106}} JSON-LD gigantic in the edtech world, moving back and forth woruld open up possibilities
* #jsonldisamonster
* +1 {{snarfed}}
* 0 {{gwg} - neutral as I turn JSON-LD into MF2 (why did you do that to yourself? :) ) To read sites that don't have MF2


==== Motivation - why to have a homepage? ====
* {{petermolnar}} (facilitator)
* +1 {{gwg}}
* Ana's post (https://ohhelloana.blog/blogging-and-me/) highlights many problems why people would be afraid of to start blogging, or inclined to stop
* DesirÃ©e points out (https://dezz.ie/web-history/letting-go-of-the-old-web/) that getting started from mobile devices is different and may need a different approach, than the Old Ways
* differences between blog vs homepage (if there are any, are there any?)
* How do would you empower people to have a personal, independent web presence?
#emotionalcore
* +1 {{hibs}}
* +1 {{jgmac1106}}
(this could be combined with {{scottgruber}} session...Why have your own web page through lens of quickly building webpage on why having a homepage is important
** this is ~100% the design choice of almost 82% of the people I onboard
*** what decision choice you mean here?
* +1 {{t}}

==== My Uncomplicated IndieWeb Setup in WordPress ====
By [https://www.linuxbookpro.com/ Joseph Dickson]
How I configured my WordPress site with IndieWeb Plugins at www.LinuxBookPro.com
IndieWeb Plugins https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/indieweb/
(Note to Organizer: Lowest Possible Priroity - I expect this would last no more than 15 minutes, I haven't prepared.)
* {gwg} wants to see this, as curious.

==== Alternate presentations for Webmentions in comments sections ====
+1 {{fluffy}}
+1 {{gwg}} - Want to support this in WP
+1 [https://www.disquisitioner.com/ David Bryant] -- I can recap my partial implementation on top of Eleventy and point to additional [[Eleventy]] + Webmention resources
+1 {{gRegor}}
+1 {{t}} -- I like the Arthur C. Clarke definition, and yes Webmention is sufficiently advanced :)

==== Storage and Presentation for Reply Contexts and Link Previews ====
* Facilitator Welcome...
* +1 {{gwg}} Looking to discuss again how you store and display previews to other URLs for reply-contexts and more.
* +1 {{t}} personally still exploring storage for reply-contexts and would like to build on related discussions from IWS 2019

====  Build a web page with HTML and CSS ====
Scott Gruber (facilitator)
Greg McVerry 
A hands on workshop or demo for beginners to feel HTML Energy. We will introduce HTML5 header, nav, main, aside and footer elements to build and style a page with CSS Grid, Flexbox and MultiColumn layout 
* {{t}} - maybe a good "Create Day" session for Sunday?

==== Gardens & Streams II ====
* Chris Aldrich (facilitator)
* A continuation of the https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-ups/GardenAndStream pop up session
* #GardenAndStream
* ...and Swale! https://bonkerfield.org/2020/05/swale-garden-stream/
* Can we focus on webmention extensions for diffierent wiki platforms? {{jgmac1106}}
* +1 {{kongaloosh}}
* +1 {{hibs}}
* +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}}
* +1 {{t}} really like this metaphor and want to see how far we can take it
* +1 {{snarfed}}

==== Badges and Gamification ====
* {{jgmac1106}} Facilitator
* I would like to return to discussion about webmention badges as learning tools. Given the recent use of indiemark and indiewebify.me I would like to discuss how we can utilize badges to encourage self assessment and community outreach. In the learning space I want to highlight how webmentions can be used in remote and online learning.

==== Rainbow Bridge to The Future ====
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* How do we use our skills as people who "took the red pill" to connect existing mainstream communities online, and provide support to those exiting the major platforms?
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(    [I suggest "indieweb adoptees" / "participants" / "practicioners"    instead of "people who took the red pill" - Maxwell Joslyn]
* Topics could include:
** AWS and Amazon's announcement of nocode
** Spotify's landgrab
** user-friendly middle ground apps, like Micro.blog (does Ghost qualify?)
** building micro-communities for non-coders
** extra support for POC, LGB..., neurodiverse, and differently-abled 
[this sounds very similar to the Cooking for Others stuff above; maybe merge the two sessions? -- [http://anaulin.org/ Ana Ulin] ]


==== Ethics (too late to think of catchy title, maybe tomorrow!) ====
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* Tracking. Url shorteners. Hit counters. Affiliate income. Accepting fiat money. Perpetuating myths v. surviving with kids. 
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(
* Topics could include:
** Aaron Parecki's mention tonight of how he gives things for free (where will that lead? how does that work for him?)
** tbc
{{maxwelljoslyn}} I don't know what you mean by "perpetuating myths vs surviving with kids", but I would like to know. Also would like to know how fiat money plays into your ideas here. Speaking of money, here are ideas for this session - website to website economy (indie payments anyone?); adding monetization to one's website (and the ethics thereof).


==== State of the Music Industry ====
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* Wtf is happening. 
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(
* Topics could include:
** Derek Sivers' new book on music (he just released yesterday IN HTML!!!)
** can we help birth a new music industry outside of ASCAP/BMI?
** building micro-communities
** See Also
https://indieweb.org/musician
{{maxwelljoslyn}} +1 i am mildly interested, as a total outsider to music industry
+1 to this Own Your Music {{jgmac1106}}
** Quit Spotify and buy an album a month...Feed artists
+1 {{fluffy}} (also bandcamp is the best way to support artists)
+1 [[User%3ABlog.taoetc.org|Beto Dealmeida]] (+1 on bandcamp)
+1 {{gRegor}} (outsider but also interested)


==== Creating a Fund for Next Gen ====
* Ki Xia (facilitator)
* My 15 year old, who can't drive or do anything at the moment, learned nocode in 1 day because I offered him $15 to make me a job posting board. To solve my problem of posting multiple POC/women in tech gigs, in 1 place across different communities. The next day, he published what he called a "text game" on Itchio, put it up for sale, and then we discovered he had created a MUD. All with no direct adult assistance. What would it take to foster this for more kids, when their whole world is burning?
* Kai your son is welcome to join us https://tech-4-teens.club starts next week. Here is registration: https://www.cfalct.org/tech4teens
** My 9 year old 7 year old want to come to this session
^Totally open to other wording, as it's 4 hours past my bedtime. :'(
* Topics could include:
** Raspberry Pi and that whole world (that is beyond me)
** Homebrew Server Club, with solar power
** computer and server building as environmental activism
** teaching of digital minimalism and responsibility of digital waste/bloat
{{maxwelljoslyn}} +1. "Ways to foster self-directed learning". Though, it might be that one good way is to leave the kid alone (within reason) and let them noodle around until they figure it out, as your son did with making a MUD. Another direction could be a tie-in to homeschooling. hey {{jgmac1106}} if you're reading this - you are officially pinged in your capacity as a professor of education :^)
+1 {{petermolnar}} I've veen self-hosting for a long while (including email)

== Instructions ==
'''Sessions are the heart of a camp.'''

Unlike traditional conference formats, IndieWebCamps have a self-organizing character, relying on the passion and the responsibility of the participants. 

Attendees ''typically'' schedule sessions by writing on a large Post-It note or piece of paper and then placing them on a 'grid' of sessions by timeslot and conference room or space. Since we're doing this camp entirely online, we're using an [[Etherpad]], an open source, real-time, collaborative document editing tool, to collect session proposals both in advance of the camp as well as the morning of the camp. 

Session proposals typically contain the following:
* A descriptive title
* A facilitator name for a session (almost always the person proposing the session)
* A longer description about what might be discussed, brainstormed, or researched during a particular session
* A unique short hashtag that will be used to create an [[etherpad]] and other possible related resources for a session

'''Everyone is encouraged to submit session ideas.''' There isn't such a thing as a bad idea for a session. You don't need to know something about a particular topic to actually propose it, it may just be something you'd like to learn about. 

If you're not sure where to start for ideas, simply ask yourself any of the following: 
* What would I like my website to be able to do? 
* How did xyz get their site to do something?
* I'd like to quit using social [[silo]] X? What would I need to do to replace that functionality to do that on my own website?
* What would I like to learn about this weekend?
* What could I help others to learn based on my past experience?
* Are there pages/ideas from the wiki that might benefit from a brainstorming session?
* ...

Past sessions are also a great source of ideas, and it can often be a good idea to revisit old session ideas to discuss new methods of approaching a problem, new design ideas, or new ideas that have come up since prior sessions. 
* [[sessions|Listings of prior IndieWeb sessions by year]]

Once everyone has had the chance to write down one (or even more) session ideas, everyone takes turns one at a time to place their Post-Its into slots on the session grid for particular time slots and rooms. Most often, new attendees are given the chance to schedule their proposals first. If there are similar or overlapping session proposals, session facilitators can discuss concatenating them into a single session. 

Once all the proposals have been put on the schedule, attendees may often do quick shows of hands for who would like to attend particular sessions to attempt to maximize attendance to physical site spaces (i.e., popular sessions should be placed into the larger rooms for each timeslot). If attendees are particularly torn between competing sessions, they can propose that facilitators move time periods in an effort to maximize attendee preference and session attendance.

Below is an example of what an in-person session grid looks like. We'll be using the session proposal etherpad to create a digital online version of this.
