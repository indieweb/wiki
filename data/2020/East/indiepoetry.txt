== Notes ==
* Affordances of the Web
** I began to learn CSS to get animated poetry out of my head.
**I like audio and mixing in images
** I've written poetry for a long time, and have wanted to make them art pieces for awhile now, especially in multimedia contexts â€” {{hibs}}
* Poetry and Mark Up
** Microformats, Feeds, and and Poetry
*** respect my space
*** your HTMNL sanitizer is killing me
*** multiple authors
*** full or excerpt
*** can I code in an always allow autoplay feature or ask?
*** A Post with another poem and comments probably an h-cite
*** but if I do an excerpt versus a full poem
*** I use multiple artifacts sometimes 20-30 each with a CC license 
** itles and Notes and Articles 
* Metadata
* Annotations by Author, by Publisher
* Display that still works on someone else's site (or, why I don't use indie readers)

* Tips For Writing Poetry
** Metaphors Matter, compare one thing to another over and over
** Write with your sense. Show don't tell. Tell me what the poet feels, hear, sees, tastes. touches
** Use images. Take the same image and write two poems with two different moods. Play with connotation and figurative language
** Use passion. Write about what you love or hate
** Write what youy see. Literal observationsa. Go outside. look at sky. Write a poem
