== Notes ==

- most examples for finding people/things are centralized: yellow pages, facebook, etc

Last.fm - cross referencing of people who like specific  bands/albums/etc.
- if you have login, and visit a profile page on last.fm it'll give you a "compatibility" % based on your listenings
Taste"buds" -> https://tastebuds.fm/

Bring back the blogroll
 > limitation on blogroll - need categorization? 
 > blend profiles (with additional info like "likes") with blogroll?
Peter's handcrafted, categorized, commented, XSLT styled OPML: https://petermolnar.net/subscriptions.opml
^^^ {{gwg}} ain' nobody got time for that

2 needs: find interesting people to follow / read their content, and make new connections

https://indieweb.org/Search_My_Site - opt in search

* notes on superfeedr: https://superfeedr.com/ - powerful unified Feed API simplifies how you handle RSS, Atom, or JSON feeds.
* https://clmoocring.jgregorymcverry.com/
* micro.blog and emoji discovery
** sports
** hobbies
** post-types

online public parks as a potential "place" to meet people

(a wild {{KevinMarks}} appears)

- local might work, global will invoke spam
- local as in:
    - community: needs gatekeepers
    - topic: might work
    - physical proximity? (see BBS)

{{jgmac1106}} "maybe discovery should be hard to tackle the problems?"
