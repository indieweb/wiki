May need some tweaking to match the schedule on the 2020/West page

__TOC__

== Session Planning ==
{{main|2020/West/Proposals}}

The biggest challenge of session planning for an online IWC is that the casual pre-event conversations that often prompt sessions later do not take place in this medium. We have tried traditional barcamp session planning, and advance session proposals. May suggest a mix this time. Goal can be that at least 50% of our sessions are proposed in advance.

We can move over some of the previously proposed topics that weren't covered at [[2020/West]] (most of them because proposers weren't in attendance) or some of the broader topics that are in the queue for popup events.

* other suggestions...


== Outreach ==
Groups we can reach out to for promotion/attendance
* Domain of One's Own: Might be worth trying to get enough session interest to do an entire track on IndieWeb and Education, particularly as the pandemic has forced education online in unprecedented ways.


== Sponsorship ==
* Volunteers to help here?


== Social Activities ==
Physical IWCs usually include a pre-event dinner the night before, shared breakfast/lunch at the event, and often dinner after the event. How can we add a social component to the event?
* RPG room
* Animal Crossing or Mariokart tournament?
* Karaoke (we did it at OER20)
* Others
* Sign up list of people to create an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse exquisite corpse] via webmention as a creative community project.

How about a Zoom lunch?
* If so, be sure to schedule additional time so people can prep lunch in real time and then return for a live stream
* Should there be a "topic" for lunch or multiple break out rooms with topics for this?


== Demos ==
Split demo session...early and late...to cover different timezones (maybe EU and Americas), but not split session days.


== Simultaneous Rooms ==
Earlier nline IWCs have often had only a single track, whereas in-person ones often have multiple rooms. IWC West had two rooms and a hallway track. Depending on session proposals we may be able to do three tracks, but need to make sure we have capability to cover this. 

* Every session should ideally have
** Facilitator
** Host (sets up tech runs the room, should not be facilitator or scribe)
** Scribe

* [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2020-05-30#t1590853473363000 We've discussed livestream from Zoom to YouTube] so that latecomers can have quick access to see prior pieces if they need to play catch up. These can also be left up temporarily until the individual sessions can be downloaded and archived.
** {{aaronpk}} may have investigated this in the past though we didn't do it at 2020 West


== Hallway Track ==
* Do we want to try something like this again?
* How? Same as last time? Ways to improve it
** We could have a "Hallway" Zoom room. If you go there, it means you want to hang out and talk shop or socialize, but not in the context of the talks/discussions which are underway. It'd be like a live version of the IRC.
** This worked out well last time, but we should make sure that at least one organizer or volunteer can "cover" it to make it more welcoming as well as appropriate in terms of CoC.


== Zoom ==
The technology of choice recently for IWC has been Zoom. Assuming we continue in this way, do we want to take advantage of breakout rooms and other Zoom features? How do we adjust the way sessions work for this medium?

Test out https://rally.video/ for possible Hallyway track or social events? morning coffee?


== To Do List ==
* Create events.indieweb.org page for the camp
* Main landing page for camp at https://2020.indieweb.org/east
* Tito set up at something like https://ti.to/indiewebcamp/iwc-east-2020
* Call for additional co-organizers and volunteers
* Call for proposals (do this in advance to encourage thinking about ideas/projects as well as to allow more session time), but still with the intent to do all scheduling the day of.
* Call for social events. Encourage social events from the community.
* Call for sponsors
