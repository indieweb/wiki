'''Sharing Gratitude'''

* Keeps a gratitude journal on her [[micro.blog]]
* Thanks Jean and Manton for inviting her
* lives here in Austin, works as an academic fundraiser
* Natalie was also introduced on an [https://monday.micro.blog/2020/01/06/natalie-hester-aka.html edition of Micro.Monday] 
* things changed about 10 months ago when their daughter was born

'''Social Media: The Good'''

* Helped connected her to moms
* Made it easy to learn things. Loved the likes and comments.
* The third party validation felt great.

'''Social Media: The Bad'''
* joined Austin Moms FB group. Over 20k members, conversations pretty intense.
* Found herself getting judgmental about some people.
* Plus a deluge of ads for weight loss
* Eventually realized wasn't part of a community that shared her values

'''Competing Missions'''
* non-profits often have different missions than the companies they work with
* libraries v publishers "support your local library"
* Companies like [[Facebook]] collect our data and inject influencers and ads
* "you just constantly feel like you're being marketed to, and judged"
* An acquaintance http://drewcastillo.micro.blog posted daily on FB. Simple statements of what he was thankful for and what he was looking forward to that day
* Last year he announced he was leaving FB and going to micro.blog
* She followed him and set up her micro.blog and started posting a daily gratitude post
* There are many days she wakes up less than grateful.
* Taking a moment to stop and think about it has improved her days.

'''Why Micro.blog'''
* Could have bought a notebook to keep a gratitude journal
* She had been inspired by Drew and thought if she shared online she might inspire someone too.
* about micro.blog: "It feels a bit like Hulu after we started paying a little bit and got fewer ads"
* The discourse seems pretty civil and content seems real
* Recommends trying to start a gratitude journal for a couple days or a week
* Keep up the good work trying to make the web better

'''Q & A'''
;Do you still use Facebook?
:I deleted my Facebook! I still use Instagram.
:Another reason why I left Facebook, was learning about Facebook's knowing in the current political climate, knowing what they're doing with political ads. I don't follow a lot of my family on Instagram, and I don't allow them to follow me. My circle is a little tighter on Instagram.

Natalie also mentioned she uses [[Marco Polo]] app to share photos and video calls; [[Chatbooks]] for printing and sharing photos.
