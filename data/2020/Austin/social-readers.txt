'''Social Readers'''<br>
by {{aaronpk}}

* Realized at one point he hadn't posted on [[Facebook]] in six months, worried people might have thought he died
* Made a post on FB explaining that he doesn't post there anymore with links to his site
* Liked [[Instagram]], but mostly used it because he had a pipeline where [[ownyourgram]] posted his photos back to his site
* They've locked down the API so that's not working as well (at all?)
* [[Twitter]] isn't really fun anymore either. Random order with the algorithm, every tweetstorm ends with the "please unroll"
* Thinks we can do something better.
* Has been posting on his own site for a while. Which is great, but very different from using it every day as a social experience.
* Integrated posting and reading experience had been missing in indieweb
* In the past we had [[Google Reader]]. Was good at aggregating stuff around the web. Was still just one direction though
* Shows [[Monocle]]
** web-based application, responsive for desktop and mobile
** there's a handful of others: [[Indigenous]] on iOS and Android and [[Together]]
* Can log in to these readers and see the same content he has subscribed to
* the list of feeds he's subscribed to lives on his site, e.g. via [[Aperture]]
* The specificaiton for this is [[Microsub]]
* Impelemented in [[WordPress]], [[Drupal]], [[Ekster]], [[Dobrado]], others
* one of the [[building-blocks]]
* Last night he got a Push notification from his site from Brian asking if the group was still at the restaurant
* Aaron went to Monocle, typed in a reply and posted it. It was published on his site and a [[webmention]] sent to Brian
* No [[silos]] involved in the interaction!
* Highlights four of our [[principles]]:
** Build things you will use yourself
** UX and design before protocols 
** Modularity
** Plurality of projects
