== Notes ==
What is trust?

=== Use cases=== 
* [[Vouch]] comment spam
* [https://ushahidi.org Ushahidi Tracker]
* Location: who do I trust to know where I am?
** Known had a 24 hour checkin delay option

Brian: [[Pine.blog]] has four levels of comment moderation. Wants some middle ground
* accept from anyone.
* ...
* don't accept

Dave: [[XFN]] for marking up relationships
=== Location ===

{{manton}}: checks in on [[Swarm]] various places (like here) where he's fine with it being relatively public, but he doesn't check into his kids' school, so would like some different levels of trust


{{t}} I also use Swarm and trust location data to a subset of friends

Difference between trusting medical records (e.g. to my doctor), and location information.

Cornelius: is there prior art?
* LinkedIn has [[endorsements]]

{{jgmac1106}} I like the concept of web rings as a trust signal as well.
