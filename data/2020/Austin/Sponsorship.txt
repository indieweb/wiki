IndieWebCamp Austin is coming up in February at Capital Factory. This is our 3rd event in Austin and I'm excited to start getting the word out and help a lot of new people discover the IndieWeb. Registration is already open: https://2020.indieweb.org/austin

Tom Brown and Jean MacDonald are joining me as co-organizers and we're looking for sponsors to help cover costs for the venue and breakfast for attendees. If you're interested in sponsoring or work at a company that would be a good fit to support the IndieWeb, please email me: manton@micro.blog.
