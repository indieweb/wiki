== Notes ==
A video has frame rate, resolution, and codec

* Frame rate - 60fps, 30fps, 24fps, etc
* Resolution - how many pixels to store
* Codec - usually codecs will store only the changes in the image data
** webm - open source codec from google
** h264 - most common codec, supported everywhere
** hevc x265 - same quality for half the file size, but requires newer devices

<pre>ffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -c:a aac -b:a 192K output.mp4

* <code>-i video.webm</code> input file
* <code>-c:v libx264</code> - use this video codec
* <code>-crf 22</code> - 22 is baseline. 28 is variable bitrate.
* <code>-c:a aac</code> - audio codec
* <code>-b:a 192K</code> - audio bitrate

Hosting videos

* Ben hosts on S3, which is cheap, but then uses CloudFront in front which is more expensive but improved latency for people dramatically

Livestreaming

* HLS is the industry standard. playlist format, shows which videos are available. you can make multiple bitrate versions available in this list.
* HLS players will know what bitrate they can download, and can switch streams
* each item in the playlist is a set of h264 files ending in .ts
* mediafilesegmenter - takes a video file and chops it up into a playlist
* mediastreamsegmenter
