== Manton Reece ==
* {{manton}}, https://manton.org
* worked on improving replies on his blog
* didn't have replies from other people to him
* shows one of his short micro.blog posts on his site and a comment from Brian
* takes the conversation from micro.blog and drops it into your page
* works via a line of javascript that passes the permalink for the post and it generates all the replies
* site is static and doesn't re-generate when people reply
* this is rolled out for everyone in micro.blog
* shows a setting on micro.blog to turn the feature on
* the javascript matches the webmentions.io format, [[jf2]]
* also a jsonfeed version

== Aaron Parecki ==
* {{aaronpk}}, https://aaronparecki.com
* did a couple small things and a kind of big thing
* his blog is listed in the [[pine.blog]] directory
* it used to say "Aaron Parecki primary" fixed on his end to remove the "primary"
* fixed a bug with [[xray]] for an edge case of photo posts. not much to show visually
* some live HTML parsing in XRay to demo. Found another edge case that wasn't fixed
* also got the livestream up that's running NOW at https://indieweb.live
* (infinite aaronpk's slowly populate the screen)

== Brian Schrader ==
* https://pine.blog/u/sonicrocketman
* shows the version that's live; didn't have mf2 so [[Monocle]] preview didn't parse anything.
* dev version now has mf2 and preview shows up!
* site was blank screen without js, now it renders without js
* also updated the [[pine.blog]] directory to a card layout instead of a list

== Jacky Alciné ==
* {{jacky}}, https://jacky.wtf
* https://follow-as-intended.glitch.me
* type in any URL and it will check for elsewhere to follow them (Github, Twitter, etc.) via [[rel-me]]

== Courtney ==
* http://crosenthal.com
* started blogging in 2002, stopped in 2018
* realized social media is not a happy place to be right now, wanted to be blogging again
* wanted to create a new blog site.
* two requirements: [[static page generation]], wanted to get away from [[CMS]], and preferably [[Jekyll]] -- wanted two content streams: articles and a link blog
* loading up IP of the site running on her laptop
* two content streams in the navigation: Blog and Flow
* built with Jekyll
* traditional Jekyll pagination doesn't support this type of use. found a jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin
* really nice alternative; multiple content streams, lot of customizations, paginate across multiple collections, keywords, etc. Looks to be powerful.
* one caveat, the plugin authors say it's not compatible with Github, so would only work if you're self hosting

== Grant Hutchins ==
* made some small improvements to his site.
* yesterday it was a card, now it's an [[h-card]]
* added a bunch of link tags: u-uid, xfn for rel-me, indieauth, aperture microsub
* shows the indieauth login flow up until selecting Github
* started to set up his own install of Aperture
* all the work today he did on an iPad; demoing his workflow now
* started on a Trello board
* most work in Safari
* mihtool app lets him view source
* A lot of split screen with Safari and Prompt app to SSH
* used vim to make live edits and see it update in split screen

== Taco Dave ==
* {{dgtd}}
* worked on The Griddle, puzzle blog, worked on discoverability by adding some content types at the bottom
* Used Inkscape to generate some SVGs
* http://beta.thegriddle.net
* nice thing about SVG is can customize via CSS
* demos changing the CSS
* changes paths to fill color red

== Joe Masilotti ==
* Joe Masilotti, http://masilotti.com
* added a footer with all of his rel-me links
* Added a Webmentions tab at the top
* has some test mentions from the checkmention app
* asks for live webmentions; some of us send them and they showed up!
* showing the source of a template; minimal javascript pulls mentions from webmention.io and injects in the template

== Tom Brown ==
* {{tbbrown}}, http://herestomwiththeweather.com
* before today [[indiebookclub]] was showing blank posts. The [[micropub]] server didn't know about the properties IBC was sending
* works now. Also links to the IBC ISBN page for the book

== Jean MacDonald ==
* {{macgenie}} http://welltempered.net
* worked on an Explaining the IndieWeb page that's more user-friendly
* [[Getting Started]] page is good but could be intimidating / confusing. Wants [[micro.blog]] community to understand what they have better.
* https://micro.welltempered.net/getting-started-with
* What is the IndieWeb, How Can I participate sections, opening outline

== Cornelius Toole ==
* https://micro.corntoole.com/
* was thinking about the ephemeral nature of stories (Snapchat, Instagram)
* first wanted to figure out storage, where to host the video/photo
* set up Backblaze B2 fronted by Cloudflare CDN+DNS
* uploaded an image and could download it on his photos.corntoole.com page
* used zuck.js (linked on wiki) to implement the stories UI
* it's a simple list of images / videos with ability to specify how long to play them
* last thing to work out is the client
* looking at PWA so people don't have to install anything

== gRegor Morrill ==
* {{gRegor}} https://gregorlove.com
* nothing to demo really, but wrote some words: https://gregorlove.com/2020/02/my-indiewebcamp-austin-2020-projects/

== Bryan Smith ==
* worked on his wife's site http://1proof.com
* as you scroll down there's a fade in of the navbar to draw attention to it
* responsive in progress, via [[Bootstrap]]
* background image is an SVG
* found he needs the xmlns in the <svg> element in order to render
* inline <svg> with `display: none`, then a `use xlink` embeds it where he wants it
* much smaller filesize and can render at multiple sizes

== Jack Wellborn ==
* http://jackwellborn.com
* was going to set up a Twitter plugin
* then gRegor told him about [[Bridgy]]
* spent the bulk of day updating/installing WordPress plugins to get it working
* one plugin was overriding another one causing problems
* decided to add mf2 classes directly in template
* "Disclaimer: any competency displayed in yesterday's IndieWeb sessions was part of an elaborate ruse."
* end of the day got it mostly updated, everything rendering pretty good

== Tantek Çelik ==
* {{t}}, https:// tantek.com
* working on a [[photo]] embed on homepage
* ended up rewriting a lot of code
* (displays homepage)
* shows "Recent Photos" embed
* shows multi photo posts
* found it to be easier to show just the first photo versus all at once
* each photo links out to their particular permalink
* link shows even more that don't appear in the grid
* each photo has [[alt]] text as well
* likes to make a separate photos page

== Jeremy Cherfas (remote) ==
* {{jeremycherfas}} didn't demo, but did install [[Bise]] and got it working
