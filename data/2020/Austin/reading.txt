IndieWebCamp Austin 2020<br>
Session: Reading posts<br>
When: 2020-02-22 15:30

== Participants ==
* {{gwg}} - Remote
* {{gRegor}} (session facilitator)
* {{macgenie}}
* {{tbbrown}}
* {{t}}

== Notes ==
* status: to read, currently reading, finished reading
* title/isbn/author's name
* p-read-status microformat - the process of adding a microformat: we could just add a p-category = to_read

statistics and reading progress seems to help encourage reading

lifecycle:
* to read: nice to have a "reason" field
* acquired (purchased, borrowed (from someone, or library), downloaded)
* started reading
* finished chapter or at a certain page number
** or read a particular section or range of pages (especially for progress)
* finished reading
* rated, reviewed, or recommended
* returned the book, or sold it, or passed it on to someone else
* retained the book in your library, possibly to loan out
    
(there may be a progress html element?)
    
idea of sharing a book
    
{{t}} has a "library of infinite loan" - only rule is "don't throw it away", ok to loan it forward on same terms, ok to return it to previous person.

roughly 300 people have used indiebookclub.biz
    
* progress: would need to add both numbers yourselves (or one of the following pairs)
** start page and end page
** end page and total number of pages
** start location and end location (for Amazon Kindle)
** end location and highest location number (for Kindle)
    
can fallback to p-summary (since there is no e-content)
