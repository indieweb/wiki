'''Without Glue, Everything Falls Apart'''<br>
by [http://pacesmith.com/ Pace Smith]

* Title: Without Glue, Everything Falls Apart
* Pace is visiting us from the future. "Welcome to 1993. Have a pile of wood"
* Imagine you're back in 1993, this technology lets you type things in and then it appears on the web page. [[guestbook]]s!
* With this same technology we could have built blogs
* In the future... and it's all built on IndieWeb technologies
* In the future: we never build the same thing twice, nobody gets betrayed, no more sexual predators, no more marketing, no more bad science, no more capitalism
* "We never build the same thing twice" - reusable functions etc.
* "IndieTrustWeb", just as website link to each other, we need people to be able to say "I trust you"
* "No more sexual predators, we had Gamergate, #Metoo, and in the future we have GlassCupidor where people post transparently about their exes"
* "No more marketing: IndieTrustWeb Goods and Services Recommender ITWGASR!"
* No more bad science:
* No more capitalism: IndieTrustWeb helps prevent fake news, "I trust you"
* media has less influence
* all of these problems get solved by IndieTrustWeb. This is the glue that holds the future internet together.
* So thanks to us for creating it.
