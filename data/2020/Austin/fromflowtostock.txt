=== Stock and Flow ===
Idea comes from an article by Robin Sloan - [http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890 Stock and Flow]
* Stock - materials that are longer in form (books) and repeatedly usable
* Flow - small things that come and go

Joe: Podcasts are a kind of flow - as I listen to them, I wish I remembered and used more of what I learn and would turn it into stock

Courtney: I want to have two separate feeds in my next blog project: links separate from [[articles]]

Cornelius: I want to subscribe to a [[podcast]] and be able to get a list of people to follow from it.

Cornelius: I use [[Overcast]] as my podcast player, it has good audio processing. I can look and see that I've saved 640 hours of time through speeding up podcasts

Jack: [[Twitter]] surfaces "Moments" which are a sort of stock made out of the flow.

Cornelius: podcasts are an intimate medium. People talk into your ear. You spend time with attention on it.

[https://www.breaker.audio/ Breaker] is a social podcast app by Leah Culver. You can discover who was a guest on a show
* You can follow people around as they show up as a guest on other podcasts.

Podcasts are hard to share. Overcast has a feature for sharing small clips and there is a web viewer.

Podcasts have advertisements, but sometimes they don't list 

Gina Trapani listed Makerbase - you can list what you create. Worked like an IMDB for podcast appearances. <nowiki>https://makerbase.co/</nowiki> (It appears to be gone now/replaced by another site)

Jack: Stock is a byproduct of flow. Either deliberately or by happenstance

Cornelius: Culture determines what value something has as stock. [[Spotify]] looks at the stream of what people listen to (flow) and turn it into [[playlist]]s (stock).
Companies can mine flow and turn it into stock

Grant: I use an app called Gladys to store things that I find and don't know what I will do with later. I can share URLs, images, video, Etc. Drafts is similar for bits of text

Cornelius: I export my [[OPML]] all the time and save it off
[http://feedbase.io/ Feedbase.io]: (by Dave Winer) you can share your OPML and see what other people subscribe to

Cornelius: How can I make sense of [[RSS]] feeds and pull out interesting people to follow?

Grant: Can you look for multiple capitalized words in a row in the title or description and link them to a Twitter search for their name?

Podcasts don't tend to use microformats when they mark up their show notes. I could look for patterns by podcast.
