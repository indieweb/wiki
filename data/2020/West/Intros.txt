== Lightning Intros ==
Welcome to the Lightning Introduction Round!

Depending on the number of participants, you'll have approximately one to two minutes to give yourself and your website an introduction with the Zoom call. 

To help keep things moving in this portion we'll have one or two people hosting/facilitating the introductions and doing the screensharing of the urls and pages you'd like to show off. 

When available, they'll show your home page or about page first and then will forward through the other URLs you provide so you can show off something interesting you've created on your personal website. You will talk through your ligtning demo and they'll tab through the URLs you provide.

If you don't yet have a website, don't sweat it!! Simply use a moment to introduce yourself, maybe a sentence or two about who you are, how you heard about IndieWeb, what you might like to accomplish over the weekend, or something you might need help doing during the two days so others will know how they might be able to assist you.

Ideally, the host(s) in the call will verbally indicate the current presenter and the name of the following presenter to allow them to be ready to unmute themselves as appropriate.

For everyone's comfort, please mute your microphone while others are presenting.
