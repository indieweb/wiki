== Instructions ==
'''Sessions are the heart of a camp.'''

Unlike traditional conference formats, IndieWebCamps have a self-organizing character, relying on the passion and the responsibility of the participants. 

Attendees ''typically'' schedule sessions by writing on a large Post-It note or piece of paper and then placing them on a 'grid' of sessions by timeslot and conference room or space. Since we're doing this camp entirely online, we're using an [[Etherpad]], an open source, real-time, collaborative document editing tool, to collect session proposals both in advance of the camp as well as the morning of the camp. 

Session proposals typically contain the following:
* A descriptive title
* A facilitator name for a session (almost always the person proposing the session)
* A longer description about what might be discussed, brainstormed, or researched during a particular session
* A unique short hashtag that will be used to create an [[etherpad]] and other possible related resources for a session

'''Everyone is encouraged to submit session ideas.''' There isn't such a thing as a bad idea for a session. You don't need to know something about a particular topic to actually propose it, it may just be something you'd like to learn about. 

If you're not sure where to start for ideas, simply ask yourself any of the following: 
* What would I like my website to be able to do? 
* How did xyz get their site to do something?
* I'd like to quit using social [[silo]] X? What would I need to do to replace that functionality to do that on my own website?
* What would I like to learn about this weekend?
* What could I help others to learn based on my past experience?
* Are there pages/ideas from the wiki that might benefit from a brainstorming session?
* ...

Past sessions are also a great source of ideas, and it can often be a good idea to revisit old session ideas to discuss new methods of approaching a problem, new design ideas, or new ideas that have come up since prior sessions.

Once everyone has had the chance to write down one (or even more) session ideas, everyone takes turns one at a time to place their Post-Its into slots on the session grid for particular time slots and rooms. Most often, new attendees are given the chance to schedule their proposals first. If there are similar or overlapping session proposals, session facilitators can discuss concatenating them into a single session. 

Once all the proposals have been put on the schedule, attendees may often do quick shows of hands for who would like to attend particular sessions to attempt to maximize attendance to physical site spaces (i.e., popular sessions should be placed into the larger rooms for each timeslot). If attendees are particularly torn between competing sessions, they can propose that facilitators move time periods in an effort to maximize attendee preference and session attendance.

Below is an example of what an in-person session grid looks like. We'll be using the session proposal etherpad to create a digital online version of this.
