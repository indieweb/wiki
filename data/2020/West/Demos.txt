__TOC__

=== Chris Aldrich ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} helped a few folks [[wikify]] themselves and [[get started]] on the wiki
* Added the ability to PESOS bookmarks from Medium to his website using RSS, IFTTT, and webhooks to his Micropub endpoint.

=== Marty McGuire ===
* https://indieweb.org/User:Martymcgui.re/IndieWeb-Sandbox

=== [https://www.disquisitioner.com David Bryant] ===
* Added dark mode slider to his Eleventy based website

=== {{kartik}} ===
* screenshare!
* https://kartikprabhu.com/section
Worked on a micropub client that uses no authentication. Can write content and add categories and get HTML, marked up with microformats2, to copy and paste as a post into his site. Hopes to add more fields. Anyone can use it!

=== Tantek ===
* https://indieweb.org/invitation_spam
* https://indieweb.org/guest_pass
Wikified some discussions today. Contrasting today's "so-and-so requested access to your private posts" flow of e.g. Instagram with an older-style "you can invite others to look at your private posts". Examples of spam include requests to connect on LinkedIn and far more.
Guest pass is a Flickr feature. Encodes into a link both what stuff they should see and some authentication bit that says they are allowed to see it. Gives them access to your stuff and browse around. Are there other systems that allow posting private/protected/friends-only content and let you create a URL to share it with people without accounts on that system?

=== {{cathieleblanc}} ===
Update my daily photo work flow 
* https://cathieleblanc.com/daily-photo/
* http://cathieleblanc.com/photography/
Been participating in daily photo challenge. Ran out of storage on hosting site and decided to figure out how to use another storage space she is already paying for. Quick fix - use service called Juicer to get a feed of Instagram posts and embed that in her site. Was easy to get working. Longer term fix - photo site is a separate WordPress site. Installed [https://splot.ca/splots/splotbox/ splotbox] theme on it and working to set it up. Will put photos in Dropbox and use splotbox workflow to post to her site.

=== Angelo ===
* https://lahacker.net/cache
* Improved local web cache to include media archival
Demos looking up music on [[Soundcloud]], results are cached on his site. Can cache the music itself. Now owns his own listening and doesn't have to listen on soundcloud! Can also keep track of the fact of listening on his site. Eventually wants to be able to shortcut posting snippets that he likes (aka /jam posts).

=== Joseph Dickson ===
* Screen Sharing: Yes
* Webmention & [[h-card]]s in [[WordPress]]
* First I mention someone's post on my website
* Next, I publish and ping my post
* Lastly, if everyhing works the other website should notice mention.
* Used indiewebify.me to learn more about h-cards.

=== Rosemary Wallace ===
* Sharing screen
* New personal site at rosemarywallace.com. Collecting her GIS work and art. Used Wix for this version, but learning HTML and Git to make a new version.

=== Jordan Brady ===
* Screen sharing? yep
* Usually shows off "exciting CSS things" but this year worked on the technical side of the site. Used a fill-in-the-blanks hCard creator on the microformats wiki (linked from indieweb.org/h-card) and found the output parsed very different than the expected microformats2!
* {{chrisaldrich}} and others note that the hCard Creator looks like microformats1
* Jordan ignored its output because it didn't look right :D
** microformats organizers note that we should probably just unlink it rather than try to update the tool
** stickers with contact info for conferences; made a sticker for indieweb (stickers not arrived yet, but has a digital mockup with a duck!)

=== Scott Gruber ===
* Screen sharing? **Yes**
* Added webmention.js and indieweb ring
* Added inline SVG tiger animation to home page. 
* https://scottgruber.me/
* Demos how to join the IndieWeb Webring!

=== Ki {{rebelle}} ===
* Wikified with the help of {{chrisaldrich}} and others. Learned about [[webrings]]. Looking forward to applying webrings and other newly learned things from IndieWeb to other communities.


=== Tantek 2 ===
* https://indieweb.org/person-tag#Rethinking_tagging_and_untagging_user_flow
* Tagging photos publicly inadvertently helps train surveillance systems like Clearview AI. Also directly used in other surveillance techniques (e.g. tagged in a photo at an event). Can we come up with better models for tagging?


=== Add Yourself ===
* Screen sharing? let us know
* URLs to show?
** ... urls ...
