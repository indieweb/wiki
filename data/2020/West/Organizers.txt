'''<dfn>2020/West/Organizers</dfn>''' is a half-day pre-meetup of IndieWebCamp [[Organizers]] to finish [[2020/West/Planning|planning last minute details]] of [[2020/West|IndieWebCamp West]], and discuss community dynamics and other [[Organizer]] issues.

They have traditionally, when occurring on West Coast time, been early enough to permit European participation. Meeting will be online only, using the IndieWeb Zoom account.

;Summary
:2020-06-26: 9:30-13:00 Organizers Meeting. Duration may be extended if all wish.

== Topics from Previous Meetings ==

=== Minimum Viable Organizing ===
{{t}}: With many years of experiences with IndieWebCamps and related events, there are some patterns as to what helps things succeed, and what causes things to either fail (not happen), have several under-participation (less than 5?), or drop a lot on the floor (unfulfilled potential).

We should have an open and honest discussion about what it actually takes for minimum viable organizing of an IndieWebCamp, including actual risk mitigations, not just a low bar of "viability", and decide if we want to have explicit requirements on what can be called an "IndieWeb" event (whether meetup, IndieWebCamp, Week etc.), and what those should be (based on successful examples).
 
Key patterns / potential sources of concern: 
* solo (or de-facto solo) organizing
* non-participation in community (not available in chat, not active on wiki)
* not detail oriented
* first time organizer (of any event) as primary organizer
* ...

Peripheral concerns: 
* not [[own your data]] (credibility gap: if an organizer is not (even) owning their notes, are they really credible to be organizing an IndieWebCamp?) 
** require organizers to also post Indie event posts?

Recommendations
* Organizer be, if not previously organized an IWC, have experience organizing similar events
* A more experienced organizer should, if possible, volunteer to support a new one
* Solo organizing remains strongly and emphatically discouraged
* Organizer should be active in chat so that they can get help from the community, even from those not attending and to answer questions regarding the event
* New organizer should, ideally, have attended one or more prior Indiewebcamps

=== Day 1 Start Hack ===
{{t}}: One thing we brainstormed right after [[2019/NYC|IWC NYC]] was a "hack start" or whatever we want to call it, session at the very end of day 1.

{{t}} proposed doing this at Brighton, but bringing it up as a possible idea for IWC West Online? We need to change the schedule accordingly.

The goal is to get folks to engage and connect something from the day 1 discussions into a creative act of some sort, just a start (nothing demoable expected obviously).

The expectation is that doing so will help motivate more people to come back on day 2.

If people start on something, and deliberately leave it incomplete, there's a built-in draw / incentive to come back and finish something.

There is a certain joy in starting something that if we can tap into, might be enough to carry them back to day 2.

This is something for everyone, not just people who don't have a domain / are getting started. It may require a few of us organizers to help "coach" folks through. Obviously organizers are coming back on day 2, so we're less concerned about losing ourselves :)

Possible example ideas to give people for a "start hack" session:
* Get a domain registered (and set its TTL to as low as possible) so it's ready by day 2. too many have struggled with this and lost precious hours on day 2 of IWCs because of this
* Create a new GitHub account or repo if they "just" want a static home page to start with (for IndieAuth etc.)
* Maybe create a new [[micro.blog]] account, but not worry about getting it all setup yet
* ...

The idea is these are things that are steps toward a particular goal, but don't need to be completed. In fact, completion is explicitly *not* encouraged during this session (not discouraged either).
