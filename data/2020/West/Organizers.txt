'''<dfn>2020/West/Organizers</dfn>''' is a half-day pre-meetup of IndieWebCamp [[Organizers]] to finish [[2020/West/Planning|planning last minute details]] of [[2020/West|IndieWebCamp West]], and discuss community dynamics and other [[Organizer]] issues.

They have traditionally, when occurring on West Coast time, been early enough to permit European participation. Meeting will be online only, using the IndieWeb Zoom account.

: Eligible individuals will be advised of the Zoom link.

== Who ==
Similar to [[2019/Organizers]], the Organizers sessions are open to everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] from 2017-2020, planning an IndieWebCamp later this year, or co-organized at least two [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups during those years, and posted at least one meetup photo. 

If youâ€™re not sure, ask an [[2020#Organizers|organizer]] or in the #indieweb-meta chat.

== Specific Topics for IWC West 2020 ==

* The Friday Night Pre-Party and how we might do social events online as people physically isolate.
* How many Zoom rooms we need for IWC West 2020?
* 'Hallway' Track - do we want to have a room set up for this. Could be on Meet, Jitsi, etc if we don't want to open up another Zoom account. 
* If we have breakout rooms, someone needs to manage them as the host.
* How to have online version of our previous photo policy 
** Generally ask, but can we have indicators in peoples' names? Emoji in Zoom names?
** Examples: ðŸ“· (yes), ðŸš«(no), ? Ask
* Encourage online Pronouns in Zoom names as well
** Are there other/better ways to do this?
* Usually there is a bit of a straw poll in in-person camps to adjust the crowd to the size of a room which tends to minimize the two person session which may become awkward. How can we recreate that in an online setting?
* See also anything left from [[2020/West/Planning]]

=== Day 1 Start Hack - Brainstormed at IWC Brighton 2019 ===
{{t}}: One thing we brainstormed right after [[2019/NYC|IWC NYC]] was a "hack start" or whatever we want to call it, session at the very end of day 1.

{{t}} proposed doing this at Brighton, but bringing it up as a possible idea for IWC West Online? We need to change the schedule accordingly.

The goal is to get folks to engage and connect something from the day 1 discussions into a creative act of some sort, just a start (nothing demoable expected obviously).

The expectation is that doing so will help motivate more people to come back on day 2.

If people start on something, and deliberately leave it incomplete, there's a built-in draw / incentive to come back and finish something.

There is a certain joy in starting something that if we can tap into, might be enough to carry them back to day 2.

This is something for everyone, not just people who don't have a domain / are getting started. It may require a few of us organizers to help "coach" folks through. Obviously organizers are coming back on day 2, so we're less concerned about losing ourselves :)

Possible example ideas to give people for a "start hack" session:
* Get a domain registered (and set its TTL to as low as possible) so it's ready by day 2. too many have struggled with this and lost precious hours on day 2 of IWCs because of this
* Create a new GitHub account or repo if they "just" want a static home page to start with (for IndieAuth etc.)
* Maybe create a new [[micro.blog]] account, but not worry about getting it all setup yet
* ...

The idea is these are things that are steps toward a particular goal, but don't need to be completed. In fact, completion is explicitly *not* encouraged during this session (not discouraged either).

==== Schedule ====

* 9:45 {{chrisaldrich}} does the intro/welcome/housekeeping
** Go over CoC
*** How can you report
*** TK: Need email from aaronpk for people to use and forward to Chris, David and other?

**** https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct#Resolving_an_Issue
*** Anna will volunteer for EU Timezone
*** or just email
*** we will look at attendee list
** Mention on Day 1 that there could be a kickoff for EU Create Day.
*** Volunteers from EU timezone to do a kick off
*** Ana suggested either 11am or 2pm in their timezone

* 10:00 Keynotes
** Final Schedule.
** Cassie Evans - making the web more whimsical
** Ryan
** Jacky confirmed for tentative title "Opening a Restaurant to Share Our Cooking"

Intros
* Chris and Aaron as hosts/pseudo moderators keeping things moving
* Aaron doing the timekeeping
* An additonal volunteeer for muting/unmuting the right people

(DONE):
* Create an Etherpad for Intros/Demos so people can queue up
** Use name and main URL as well as any specific URLs for the introduction
** Chris will do the screenshare for all ideally to cut down on the back and forth
* Chris and Aaron will "host" the  demos
** People paste in their urls
** keep a queue in the Etherpad
*** chrisaldrich suggests being explicit in demos to covering the building blocks like webmentions, micropub
*** be careful with jargon
*** we should do this but save to end
*** stress new members
*** let people tell off their stuff
*** We are intoducing ourselves through our domain. That is the purpose of the intros


* 45 minute Goal Setting/Basic set up on Day 1

* Day II EU Demo Time 10AM at start of West Create Day
* Looking for EU volunteer "welcome to Day Two message"

* IndieWeb 101 Day II
** Depending on level interest may add an EU intro session at 04:00 am


Have a specific room at the end of the day as a Create room to get people going 

* If we have breakout rooms, someone needs to manage them as the host.
* How to have online version of our previous photo policy 
** Generally ask, but can we have indicators in peoples' names? Emoji in Zoom names?
** Examples: (See {{chrisaldrich}} version on zoom (yes), (no), ? Ask
* Encourage online Pronouns in Zoom names as well
** different people use different pronouns in their communities
** just because they use pronouns here they may feel safe and not use the same pronouns elsewhere
** we should probably only take pics with no names or just names displayed

* Moderator??
** Every room should have a facilitator and moderator (tummeler?)
** watch the etherpad, look for questions, 
** watch for people dominating the conversations
** Notetaker/Scribe instead
** online the scribe doesn't get involved a ton of work


* Are there other/better ways to do this?
** Usually there is a bit of a straw poll in in-person camps to adjust the crowd to the size of a room which tends to minimize the two person session which may become awkward. How can we recreate that in an online setting?
** See also anything left from [[2020/West/Planning]]

Tips from Ana:
* Have an explicit moderator in every room!
* Have a prepared set of things to talk about.
* Beware of people who take over conversations, people are shy, and trying to find the right social cute to jump into the conversations
* Do you best to give everyone equal opportunity to say something
* Video moderation makes it difficult
* Stay in gallery view
