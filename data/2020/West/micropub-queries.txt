== Notes ==
* Micropub Queries are an experimental extension to the Micropub spec to allow querying existing content on your own website  (why not a shared syndicated place) in a variety of ways
* How can we formalize and start to use Micropub Queries to start making more engaging experiences on the IndieWeb

** https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions
** https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/4
** Grant's proposal for this session: https://grant.codes/2020/06/27/micropub-queries

aaronpk suggests: we have a lot of folks here who have worked on micropub clients or servers - should we choose some features to commit to implementing?
* manton and aaronpk coordinated at IWC Austin (/2019/Austin ?)
* swentel and gwg coordinated with Indigenous + Drupal WordPress


iA Writer's new micropub support includes the flag for draft (it only posts drafts)
* post status is an experimental micropub property. querying "double-experimental"
* New Property: Post Status https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/19

Preview URL for drafts
* https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/26

Need a way to query for supported properties/types/etc in order to have clients adapt the UI to what's supported in a server
* Query for supported queries:  https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/7
* Query for supported properties: https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/8
* Query for unsupported properties: https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/21 (is this the inverse??) Yes?
Should sites explicitly say what properties & queries support or follow the micropub idea of storing everything even if the site doesn't know how handle it

* perhaps these break down into two categories
** properties that can be ignored if they're not supported
** properties that may be harmful if they're ignored (e.g. a micropub server that doesn't support draft status will make a public post)
*** draft/published
*** another example: post visibility https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/11
*** and location visibility https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/16
*** audience https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/12
*** Private Posts and Audience

* is the distinction whether the property ends up as part of the post or is a command to the server?

Querying for original posts
* grant - queries for a watch-of property matching a movie URL
* aaronpk - queries for an original post of a syndication URL


User-feature descriptions
* "finding and searching for posts and draft posts, and edit them"
* "have i already imported this?"
* "have i already responded to this?"
* autocomplete for mentions

We reviewed https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Implementations adding known client and server implementations that weren't listed for various features.

* bumped several from Proposed to Stable.
