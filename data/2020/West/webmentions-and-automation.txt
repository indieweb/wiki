Session: Codeless automation tools and the indieweb + How webmentions and the web work<br>
When: 2020-06-27 13:15

== Proposal ==
* Introduction about http and web technologies underlying the Webmentions spec for beginners 
* IFTTT, Zapier, Integromat, etc - how can they be useful for us, who is using for them, and for what
** discussion on using these tools for indieweb purposes, such as syndication, PESOS, etc
** benefits and drawbacks
** personal experiences with these services
** demos, if anyone can provide one

== Notes ==
Peter is doing a screen share to show https://www.integromat.com/ to show how how an RSS feed as a source of truth goes through a number of steps how. see image with the flowchart at https://cloud.petermolnar.net/index.php/s/w2KBTsTDoZWMFE2/preview

1. have a URL like an RSS feed
2. Method: HTTP Get request
- Sends push notification to a phone
3. filter out photos and notes (everything in the rss feed with an enclosure is a photo or category doesn't not contain notes.
4. ping Bridgy for flickr. make a requests and a push request. 

Bridgy trigger is a [[webmention]]. [[webhook]] is a generic term for a service that is doing something for you. sends an HTTP Request. Webmention is a specific kind of requests. 
 
Here's a link for how {{chrisaldrich}} leverages RSS feeds and IFTTT to create posts from a variety of social media sites to his website using micropub. If you've got a micropub plugin or set up, it requires little code, and what code it does can be cut and pasted and pieces can be logically replaced:

Similar high level call to action: https://snarfed.org/2019-07-19_37909

DIfference between automation on the web (e.g. adjacent to browser) vs automation from your OS (e.g. adjacent to your desktop experience -> Alfred, Hazel, etc)

Bridgy has open requests to add 28 different new silos: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+silo%22 . Realistically, most of those will never get implemented. But they could, in a no code tool! Ryan would happily help anyone who wants to try, just ping him.

* not just the web based services, but the OS level ones are similar - they could easily be used as, for example micropub clients

* silos are adding surprising features, like micropub

For what it's worth I'm taking breif notes and thoughts at. Nothing in detail more like idle thoughts. https://www.linuxbookpro.com/codeless-automation-tools-and-the-indieweb-how-webmentions-and-the-web-works/

* the vocabulary of our tech stack is confusing. A  generic cheat-sheet could be useful (what's a webhook? what's a micropub? etc)  Indieweb site has a wiki with documentation of these different terms. 

* android app [[Indigenous]] can be a source for WordPress via micropub

* {{hibs}} would like to connect fully static / handcrafted services to other sites
* she also described webmentions for [https://hexo.io/ Hexo]
