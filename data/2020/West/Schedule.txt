=== Friday Pre-Party 20:00-22:00 ===

The night before camp, we're continuing our tradition of a pre-camp dinner...except we will be eating together apart. So, set a place setting in front of your webcam and join us for some distance socializing. In respect to other timezones, you need not bring dinner. Other meals, snacks, etc are welcome. We will set up some Zoom break out rooms for people to pop into for some conversations.

<br>'''Day 1''' is an introduction to the IndieWeb and discussions in a BarCamp-like environment. [[2020/West/Proposals|Bring a topic you'd like to discuss]] or join in on topics as they are added to the board.

<br>'''Day 2''' is about creating or making things for our websites! Direct your inspiration from what we discussed on day 1 into something on your site. Collaborate with others or work on your own. We'll have [[2020/West/Demos|demos]] at the end of the day to see what everyone worked on!
