=== Remote Participation ===
* [[Zoom]] We kept a Zoom open from 9AM-5PM Pacific time(based on the timezone of the majority of attendees) for people to create together. This was not recorded.
* [[Etherpad]] - We had an etherpad for organization, a project list, and brainstorming on the day of the event. These were archived to the wiki at [[2020/Create/Notes]]
* [[discuss|IndieWeb chat]] - there are a variety of methods/ways to [[discuss|access the various chat channels on the wiki]].
<!-- If you can't get to the event, consider remote participating or finding/running an IndieWebCamp remote party near you. -->
