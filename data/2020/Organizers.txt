=== Summit Planning Improvements ===
(for improving upon 2020, for [[2021]])

Listing this first so we can braindump while it is fresh in our heads, without first crowding our brains with more issues / discussions.

This is specifically about what we did this time [[2020/Planning]] that we could have done better, with the goal of doing better for [[2021/Planning]]!

Please save all "We should also have xyz at Summit that I wanted (for me or on behalf of others) but I was not going to spend any time myself to make happen" for a specific issue down below.

Specific points that need improvement
* ... to be added day of Organizers Summit 2020

== Next Time ==
These topics were suggested but did not get discussed at this Organizers Summit.
* ...

== Previously ==
2019 Organizers meetups:
* [[2019/Berlin/Organizers|Berlin]]
