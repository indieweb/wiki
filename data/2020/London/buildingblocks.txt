== Notes ==
* IndieWeb Building blocks can be used indenpendently
* It begins with microformats
** [[indiewebify.me]] checks out the microformats
** At the top level a post is an h*
*** p-name says the title
*** p-author- author
*** dt-published date/datetime published
*** microformats allow you to parse html and use that information elsewhere
* reply posts use webmention
** webmentions tell a url you link to it
** if you look in my head you will see rel="webmention"
** {{kevinmarks}} demos his receiever which is built by {{voxpelli}} and deployed on heroku
*** ask nicely or deploy on your own
** when you publish it looks at the webmention and send a note to webmention heroku
** how you present the webmention is up to you
** Question "How does it work on Twitter"
*** Twitter doesn't do it on your own but you can use [brid.gy bridgy] [[bridgy]]
** You can use [https://telegraph.p3k.io/ telegraph] to send webmentions. 
As it's a form POST, you can use an HTTP form to do it, i.e. the form on https://seblog.nl/2020/03/14/1/remote-attending-indiewebcamp or https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/03/oogau/

Can send it yourself manually, or you can use a tool like https://github.com/willnorris/webmention

https://webmention.app/ also is a great tool for auto-sending Webmentions on your behalf - great for static sites

https://webmention.io/ can be used with a static site and can be rendered with https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js/ client-side

**wonders if I can do this, would mean adding javascript to my site
*** ^ it can be done at site render time, too, if that helps! the API is public, and until WM.js, {{jamietanna}} was doing that
If you want to write your own sending/receiving endpoint then start with https://webmention.rocks 
** https://github.com/jgmac1106/homepage/blob/master/notes/2020-03-14-1.php 
*** https://jgregorymcverry.com/notes/2020-03-14-1 became https://twitter.com/jgmac1106/status/1238819847431225346 using [[bridgy]]
https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ works similar to webmention.io

*indiewebify.me
** walks you through step by step through a post

* IndieAuth
** you can sign into different servies
** on the homepage of your site
** You mark up in your head how you want to authorize
** [[rel-me]]
*** one way you explain to site this is you you likt to sites and say this is me
*** if two sites point at each other the sites agree that they are by the same person
*** {{kevinmarks}} demos a browser plugin (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/verify-me/nnefkajddpfponfnmaflddipljfdlcjb)
*** you get a check mark to any site with rel=me
*** If you link to your normal Twitter profile page you don't get a rel-me; but your intent page has one, e.g. https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=barryf

* h-card
** a "business card" of your website
** an h prefix says this is a structure, the fields inside the h-card are part of that structure
** you can nest them
*** for example an h-card inside an h-entry can be used for author https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats
