We’re looking forward to seeing you in a few days! We know the coronavirus is top of mind for many. Our biggest concern continues to be everyone’s safety. As of the situation until today, [[2020/London|IndieWebCamp London]] '''is still proceeding as planned.'''

However, we have taken a number of risk management steps:

* Please fill in the form for extra information regarding COVID-19 (https://forms.gle/GbVsAXVCyR67Gcra8) This is to ensure that we will be informed if someone has been to the highly affected area.

* We have been in frequent communication with the venue regarding the situation, we have been advised that additional cleaning measures have already been put in place.

* We advise all participants to wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds frequently and avoid shaking hands.

* If you are feeling unwell, we recommend you stay at home and join remotely. Information regarding remote participation can be found here: https://indieweb.org/2020/London#Remote_Participation

We understand that due to the way the virus is spread, public events do unfortunately increase the risk of contamination. If you still feel that you are not comfortable joining at the venue, you are also welcome to participate remotely, please kindly let us know by changing the RSVP in the form above or contacting the organisers.
