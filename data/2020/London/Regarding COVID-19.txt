The organising team and the venue have made risk assessments with the most recent situation of COVID-19. 

We decided to limit to '''ONLY REMOTE participation''' for IndieWebCamp London on 14th and 15th March 2020.

It was a very difficult decision to make, but we have the safety of all participants in mind and have to put it as the highest priority of all. 

We apologise for the disappointment and inconvenience that it has caused. If you need assistance regarding your scheduled travel, please feel free to reach out to us.
