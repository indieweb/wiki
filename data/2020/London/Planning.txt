'''<dfn>Planning</dfn>''' for [[2020/London|IndieWebCamp London 2020]].

== Initial Planning ==
This is an archive of the initial planning for IndieWebCamp London 2020, [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Planning&oldid=78383#London originally found here].

IndieWebCamp London, UK

'''Date''': 14th &15th March 2020

'''Venue''': Microsoft Reactor

RSVP: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indiewebcamp-london-2020-tickets-85763160923

Catering sponsored by TerminusDB
* Pastries and fruits in the morning; and vegetarian lunch (with some dishes vegan-friendly) on the 2nd day

Keynote: Something about JSON-LD and micro formatting (TBC)

Social evening (14th) ideas (pay your own):

* Gong bath + tea: http://www.londongong.co.uk/ - £250 for 12 - too expansive in my opinion
* another similar gong bath + tea: https://www.soundmysterium.com/ - not available 14-15th
* Games: https://www.plonkgolf.co.uk/venue/hoxton - event starts form £15 pp - wheelchair accessible - ask again about details after the new year
* <add other suggestions>

Tasks/ things to figure out:

* AV system at the venue for remote participants - onsite Live screaming and recording provided

* ''Ticketing system (most probably using Eventbrite), types of tickets - free tickets on sale now (done)''

* ''Stickers, pronoun batches, stickies and stationaries - do we get them from IndieWeb org? (done)''

* Stationary for the day: markers, labels, additional informative stickers;

* List of lunch recommendations for first day;

* Find a place for the social bit in the evening (ideally a place that does food too);

Can help co-organize:
