Discussing the Microsub concept and how to massage feeds into the format that Microsub needs(jf2)

* microsub split into two parts
* backend and client
* ryan did newsblur to microsub bridge
* run a ms server that is connecting to newsblur
* aaron made aperture, most full featured backend at the moment
* yarns is another backend
** functional, but not the same storage capacity as the others
* how do you take whatever source you want and massage it into microsub format?
** you could do it for anything, that's one of its advantages
** it just expects jf2, simplified version of microformats
* post has to have published date, etc
* Wordpress REST API converted into microsub feed
** takes any wordpress site
** turns it into a feed that can be read in any microsub endpoint
* question is: what do people want to be able to read?

=== What We are Reading ===
* RSS Feeds
** {{jgmac1106}} uses inoreader

* Mastodon feeds (they provide rss/atom)
* WordPress REST API
* People - follow their content across platforms
* Meetup events feeds https://www.jvt.me/tags/meetup-mf2/
* Follow tags on a site, to avoid content overload
* imdb, discogs
* notifications - comments on posts, mentions, etc could be sent into a Microsub channel

** https://monocle.p3k.io/preview?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjgregorymcverry.com%2Fmypoetry audio

* any criticisms of microsub protocol?

** it doesn't support multiple authors
** happens a lot in the academic world

* does it become a big maintenance burden trying to parse so many external feeds?
** json-ld is pushed by google, so it's a safe bet for now
** rss has longevity
