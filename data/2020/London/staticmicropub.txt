When using a static website it may mean that something had to be done manually (Example RSVPs)

* publishes via micropub from micropublish.net
* keeps raw microformats of the posts in gitlab
* micropub endpoint write to gitlab using gitlab api

* micropub is a standard format,  so multiple clients can publish to one endpoint
* clients don't need to know how the site is dealng with it on the backend
** minimum you need to support is a form post request

* jamie's endpoint writes to gitlab via api

Jamie created a micropub using java and is available in a repo in gitlab.

are there any JS only micropub endpoints?
* kevin: there is a library for it
** demos a glitch project [https://glitch.com/~it-me-web https://glitch.com/~it-me-web]
** https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/

* netlify functions is another option
** aws lambda that does the work for you
** still use nodejs on the backend
* jamie stores images on netlify
** static page that posts to a aws lambda on netlify that sends a post request somewhere else

* can you have multiple micropub endpoints?
** no
** what is the use case? using for example standard WP endpoint to publish content to website, but another endpoint (e.g. jamie's software) to post also to git repo
** could make use of mp-extension https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Destination
** could also write a wrapper so that existing endpoint forwards to both

* jamie demos posting via micropub to both staging and production sites (given you can only have one endpoint)
