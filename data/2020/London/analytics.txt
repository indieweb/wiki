== Notes ==
* {{jamietanna}} enjoys having analytics on his site to discover where people find his data, ?
* Lewis mentions there are risks for data collection, protection
* Cheuk doesn't like having Google (Analytics) having that data
* {{jgmac1106}} does not use analytics, wants to add for his vita and to encourage [[samzidat]] Use server logs to watch traffic spikes
* Dan proxies Gravatar (despite working for Automattic) because that can lead to tracking users / posts
* Carol mentions Fathom
* Seb only uses server logs
* Barry uses CloudFlare as a CDN before the site
* Jamie mentions that seeing the source of spikes in traffic is quite nice
* It's a balance between how much do you want to know vs need to know - what makes it popular, what do people want?
* Jamie uses Blogumentation as a way to write for himself - it's great to see other people seeking it out / reading it, but it's not the end goal (for most content)
* Ana doesn't render webmentions, similar to not wanting analytics - doesn't really care if people sees/interacts with it  
** note by {{ana-r}}: I don't think I explained myself correctly: I care about people interacting with me (and try to I interact back) but I prefer not to see analytics and I don't render webmentions (likes) because I associate "likes" with social media likes and currently to me these may have a negative feeling associated with it. 
* {{jgmac1106}} just added cloudfare analytics just no
* Tracking vs analytics - does it mean for i.e. better advertising, or just passive interest in who uses the site?
* WordPress plugin for Matomo: https://piperhaywood.com/switching-from-google-analytics-to-matomo-f-k-a-piwik-on-wordpress/
