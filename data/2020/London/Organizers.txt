== Topics ==
Normally we go through the topics in order on the [[Organizers]] page, and triage / prioritize from there as well as what we (those who show up to the Organizers meetup) find particularly worthy to pursue.

If there is an urgent topic that requires addressing before this specific IndieWebCamp (e.g. speakers, a format change, etc.), that may be added here. Be sure to note your name/link.
