''Ad-hoc Collaboration Rooms will be available throughout the Projects Time.''<br><br>
'''Projects people are working on:'''

* {{chrisaldrich}} working on some getting started and funnel related wiki pages [[Quick_Start]] and [[User:Boffosocko.com/homepage|IndieWeb homepage]] draft (commentary/edits/collaboration welcomed); creating a [[colophon]] page on his site
* {{ana-r}} I converted my blog from jekyll to eleventy recently but there's quite a lot of things I still need to do: styling, webmentions, add CMS, pagination and remove my micropub endpoint (which was for jekyll) and try to create a new one.
* {{doubleloop}} following on from [[2020/London/OwnYourRSVPs|OwnYourRSVPs session]], remove myself from the Meetup silo.  Follow events through Jamie's tool; get a feed of events in my social reader; RSVP to events via the support Jamie added to brid.gy; publish my 'agenda' page (like [https://seblog.nl/agenda Seb's]) for others to discover events; maybe an RSVP iCal feed? (like [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/27/rsvp-calendar/ Jamie's]).
* {{jgmac1106}} I want to add a layout for articles without a featured image, add torrents for all my educational videos, use subgrid on my article cards.
* {{calumryan}} Convert five years worth of short form post entries in my database to flat files in preparation to use [[Kirby]] for all of my website.
* {{jamietanna}} has a few, in priority order:
** Add a [[birthday]] indicator for his upcoming birthday on Tuesday - https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/jvt.me/-/merge_requests/713
** Add a new Microservice for his [https://indieweb.org/website-analytics#Matomo Matomo] analytics that can be rendered on his site, to improve visibility and discoverability
** Add Micropub Edit support to his Micropub server
** Provide silo-aware profile URLs - i.e. when posting a note with a profile URL reference, rewrite it to their Twitter account for Twitter syndication
* {{carolgilabert}} refactoring my RSVPs to be read from a JSON file, so I can get a micropub implementation working and send those from my phone.
* {{sebsel}} is trying to make a simple Micropub app for iOS. (Potential giant project, no promises. First goal: have a text input and send that to the server.)
* {{cheuk}} and {{LewisCowles}} are going to setup webmention send + receive
* {{barryf}} aims to improve the instructions and error messages from [[Micropublish]]. If time allows, I'll add post-status as an option.
* {{murray}} wants to set himself up on the Wiki (✅) and then update content types with [[microformats]]. If there's any time left, fix my calendar month code which is buggy.
* {{addyourself}}
