<span class="p-summary description">'''<dfn class="p-name summary">IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2020</dfn>''' are stand alone single topic sessions started in 2020, partly in response to the coronavirus pandemic that has prevented the long history of regularly occurring in-person camps in various cities.</span>

While not designed to be the traditional two day camps of sessions and creating, they are meant to foster ongoing discussion and development of topics of interest to the IndieWeb community.

If you're interested in hosting one, feel free to go to [[2020/Pop-up/Sessions|Session Proposals/Brainstorming]] page and begin to flesh out your event, or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org IndieWeb chat].
