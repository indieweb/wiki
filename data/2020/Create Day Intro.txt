=== An IndieWeb Sandbox ===
What can be done with free tools to give folks something to try-before-they-buy?
Planning to look at neocities.org for hosting static HTML/files and glitch.com for the active glue for IndieWeb building blocks like Micropub, IndieAuth, and more.
* {{schmarty}}
* interested in helping: {{ben_thatmustbeme}}

{{schmarty}} has some brainstorming here: https://indieweb.org/User:Martymcgui.re/IndieWeb-Sandbox
very slowly starting a glitch project here to work through some of the onboarding ideas: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sapphire-sulky-clover


=== Adding a user hovercard ===
(on reply/single.html page on Micro.blog ) 

Using .Params.reply_to_avatar and .Params.reply_to_username to the hovercard. Hopefully, can find a way to add more things by the end of day.

=== Including Avatars in Webmentions ===
* [https://www.linuxbookpro.com/ Joseph Dickson]

Create an h-card that includes my site avatar when I share a webmention response from my site to another user

Example of a current webmention: https://www.linuxbookpro.com/webmention-post-to-chris-aldrich/
The anonymous avatar that resulted: https://boffosocko.com/2020/03/26/55769669/#div-comment-283246
Ideal Result would be an icon hosted on my site such as WordPress' "custom-logo" or a specfic image such as https://www.linuxbookpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/linuxbookpro-192x192-1.png


=== RSS / Webmentions using IFTTT ===
* Specific focus on Using RSS Feeds to send automatic webmentions with IFTTT 
* ... would like to create several RSS Feeds (by content) and use them to trigger an IFTTT action to a webmention endpoint
* https://paulopinto.page
* {{paulopinto}}


=== AutoAuth ===
* {{sknebel}} not really a project for me today, but if you want to discuss it ping me in chat
* {{jackyalcine}} - learning more of the weeds so I can begin working to add this to [[Fortress]]
* {{aaronpk}}


=== Light/Dark theme selector  ===
* [https://www.disquisitioner.com/ David Bryant] - Several sites demoed yesterday had selectors to let visitors chose light or dark theme based on an in-page control, and I'd like to add that to my site (www.disquisitioner.com). I've done some preliminary investigating (e.g., https://mxb.dev/blog/color-theme-switcher/) and, given my site is based on Eleventy, propose to use a combination of Nunjuck templating and HTML data-attributes (which are new to me).  


=== Better blog post design ===
* {{aaronpk}} - I haven't been super happy with my blog post page design lately so I am making a few changes to it

=== Fixing up Webmention stuff ===
* {{jackyalcine}} Fixing the discovery tool at https://lighthouse.black.af/tools/sending/preview
* {{jackyalcine}} Implementing asynchronous Webmentions for [[Fortress]] users

=== Getting started in IndieWeb! ===
* {{rebelle}} - Figuring out where the door is. ;) If Micro.blog is good enough for now, as I don't have a hand-coded site yet. Though I did create an html page that loads properly everywhere, with zero CSS, because I was mad at crappy CSS everywhere. 


=== Investigating Web Rings ===
* as a possible SDI solution for the Nocode movement, where I am based 
* {{rebelle}} - Multiple conversations this week with the leaders of Nocode, as Amazon launches their Honeycode (?) product. How to record the rapid development so far, and catalog 100s of new projects every day when the entire field, by definition, has little understanding of html. Is a web ring a possible solution?


=== WordPressy Stuff  ===
{{gwg}}

* Updated each repo as I worked on it to use a trunk instead of master branch
* Fixed URL rewrites to allow pagination in onthisday and kind based date archives
* Fixed URL rewrites to allow map views on any taxonomy or user
* Backported various tweaks into IW26 upstream from TwentySixteen and _s
* Added simple map view link to various archive pages inside theme
* Updated Syndication Links for WordPress to support Reddit as an option, merged some PRs and refreshed the icon set

Demo URLs:
* https://david.shanske.com/2018/11/28/ - Note map link to map on archive pages
* 


=== Update daily photo work flow ===
