<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Salmentions</dfn>''' are a protocol extension to [[Webmention]] to [[comment-propagation|propagate comments]] and other interactions upstream by sending a webmention from a response to the original post when the response itself receives a response (comment, like, etc.). </span> The original post then checks the response to the original, parses the response to the response (e.g. comment on a comment) and then displays it as an additional response on the original post.

<dfn>Webmention with Salmentions</dfn> depends on understanding [[Webmention]]. Please read that first.

The name is a portmanteau of [[#Salmon]] and [[mention]].

== Protocol ==
=== Sending Salmentions ===
An implementation that sends and receives [[Webmentions]] can send Salmentions by doing the following:

When it receives and accepts a Webmention from a response to an original post:
* Incorporate (or update) the response into the original post’s permalink by nesting the response inside the original, keeping track of whether any changes actually occurred.
** E.g. incorporate a [[reply]] as a nested comment [[h-entry]] inside the original’s [[h-entry]]
* If there were any changes (a new or updated response), then resend Webmentions to everything the original post sent webmentions to.

That act of resending those Webmentions when an original post is updated in response to responses is called “sending Salmentions”.

=== Receiving Salmentions ===
An implementation that receives [[Webmentions]] can receive Salmentions by doing the following:

When it receives a Webmention, in addition to normal Webmention processing:
* Store the contents of the source of the Webmention in such a way that it can be rechecked in the future for any changes.

When it receives a previously received Webmention:
* Check the source of the Webmention for any changes since the previous Webmention (using aforementioned stored contents), in particular any new responses to the source
** E.g. check for new nested comment [[h-entry]](s) inside the source’s [[h-entry]]
* Incorporate any new response(s) to the source both into those stored contents, and display as inline responses to the target itself.
** E.g. displaying a reply to a reply, as an additional comment on the original post.
** If the previous Webmention generated a [[notification]], then the new response(s) should as well.

The act of noticing a re-receiving of a Webmention and doing something when there are changes in the source, specifically nested responses, is called “receiving Salmentions”.

== Related ==
=== ActivityPump ===
{{main|ActivityPump}}
[http://w3c-social.github.io/activitypump/#notification ActivityPump] describes a similar process to Salmention for propagating updates between systems. If one of your posts receives a mention (eg. as the target of a like, repost or inReplyTo, etc), your server should send the ''new post'' (the one that mentions you) to ''all recipients'' of your original post. (In ActivityPump, your server pushes your posts out to your followers, and retains a list of everyone posts are sent to, but this basically translates to sending a webmention to the original post).

=== Salmon ===
{{main|Salmon}}
The [[Salmon]] protocol is a predecessor to [[#ActivityPump]] that broke useful conceptual ground but never gained widespread adoption. It's part of the [[OStatus]] protocol suite.
