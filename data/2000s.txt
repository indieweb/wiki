The '''<dfn>2000s</dfn>''' was a decade that began with the dotcom bust and saw the rise of [[blogs]], services like [[Technorati]], standards-based web development, the inventions of [[Pingback]], [[RSS 2.0]]/[[Atom]], [[microformats]], and the emergence and growth of [[social media]] silos, and eventually web-capable smart phones in the late 2000s, all accompanied with a shift to silver or shiny aesthetic.

== Aesthetics ==
Drastically shifting from the [[1990s]] brightly colored translucent aesthetic, the late 1990s into the early 2000s saw the rise of shiny silver or chrome colored devices and products, subsequently dubbed "chromecore". Much of this shift from colorful to uniform was reflected in the designs of websites as well.

Website design / forum example:
