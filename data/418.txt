'''<dfn>418</dfn>''' is a little teapot, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. When I get all steamed up, hear me shout! Tip me over and pour me out!

Specifically, an April Fools [[joke]], specified by [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324 RFC 2324: Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)]. The HTTP 418 status was later reserved by [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110 RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics] acknowledging it is ‚Äúdeployed as a joke often enough for the code to be unusable for any future use‚Äù.

16 years after the original April Fools, an ‚Äúextension to HTCPCP to allow for pots to provide networked tea-brewing facilities‚Äù was published in the form of [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7168 RFC 7168: The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol for Tea Efflux Appliances (HTCPCP-TEA)]. This extends the use of the 418 error to all ‚ÄúTEA-capable pots that are not provisioned to brew coffee‚Äù.

=== Stack Overflow ===
[[Stack Overflow]] uses (used) 418 as an [[easter egg]] error code for failing [[XSRF]]/[[CSRF]] checks during form submissions, e.g. during login.

<blockquote>There's really no good HTTP status code for an XSRF violation, but it feels like it should be a class 4 code. Any objection to returning a 418?</blockquote>
