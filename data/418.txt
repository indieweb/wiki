{{stub}}

'''<dfn>418</dfn>''' is a little teapot, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. When I get all steamed up, hear me shout! Tip me over and pour me out!

Specifically, an April Fools [[joke]], specified by [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324 RFC 2324: Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)]. The HTTP 418 status was later reserved by [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110 RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics] acknowledging it is “deployed as a joke often enough for the code to be unusable for any future use”.
