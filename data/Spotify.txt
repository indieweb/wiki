== Exporting ==
=== SaveMyMix ===
[http://www.hpincket.com/savemymix SaveMyMix] is a quick and easy tool for exporting your playlist data from Spotify (more services coming soon). It encodes playlist data in CSVs and zips the files for download. All of this is done client side in the browser. This helps you maintain data independence and reduces reliance on 3rd party services.

== Criticism ==
=== Creepy Privacy Policy ===
A recent [[privacy]] policy update was critiqued by WIRED, which caused Spotify to clarify:
