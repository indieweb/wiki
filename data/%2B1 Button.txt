{{stub}}

The '''<dfn>[https://developers.google.com/+/web/+1button/ +1 Button]</dfn>''' is a [[webaction]] button proprietary to [[Google+]] that is essentially their version of a [[like]] button.

[[Google+]] allows you to put a "+1" button on any page that when clicked, does a "+1" (similar to a like) of your page, inside Google+, on the Google+ profile of whoever clicked the button.

== Criticism ==
=== Recommends proprietary Google XML ===
The first example (in their docs) of how to embed a +1 button in HTML uses this proprietary XML:
<blockquote><code><nowiki><g:plusone></g:plusone></nowiki></code></blockquote>

=== Recommends nonsemantic DIV ===
The "HTML5-valid +1 tag" (thus admitting their g:plusone XML isn't really valid) example has:
<blockquote><code><nowiki><div class="g-plusone" data-size="tall" ... ></div></nowiki></code></blockquote>

== History ==
=== Google IO 2013 motivation ===
At [[Google IO 2013]], in the "Google+ Platform Overview" session, the Google presenters said that one motivation to add +1 buttons to your pages is that Google search results show who +1'd a post.

However, Google has since (2014? 2015?) dropped that aspect of Google search results, which no longer show who +1'd a post, whether you're logged into Google+ or not.
