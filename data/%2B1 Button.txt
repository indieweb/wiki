{{stub}}

The '''<dfn>[https://developers.google.com/+/web/+1button/ +1 Button]</dfn>''' is a [[webaction]] button proprietary to [[Google+]] that is essentially their version of a [[like]] button.

[[Google+]] allows you to put a "+1" button on any page that when clicked, does a "+1" (similar to a like) of your page, inside Google+, on the Google+ profile of whoever clicked the button.

== Why ==
Due to the diminishing use of [[Google+]] and the removals of both search results effects, and the +1 counts from the "+1" button (see [[#History]] below for citations), it’s not clear there is any reason left to actually include a "+1" button on your site or blog posts.
* (please provide your own personal reasons "Why" if you happen to put "+1" buttons on your own site)

Instead, consider putting a [[like]] [[webaction]] button on your [[posts]], with fallback(s) to whichever silos a post is [[POSSE]]d to.

== How ==
(stub)

Is there a way to provide "+1" button functionality via a simple hyperlink rather than a heavy JS embed?

See also [[webactions]] for how to put service-independent buttons like a generic "like" button on your posts.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(none so far)

Or perhaps {{snarfed}} does on his posts?

== Criticism ==
=== Recommends proprietary Google XML ===
The first example (in their docs) of how to embed a +1 button in HTML uses this proprietary XML:
<blockquote><code><nowiki><g:plusone></g:plusone></nowiki></code></blockquote>

=== Recommends nonsemantic DIV ===
The "HTML5-valid +1 tag" (thus admitting their g:plusone XML isn't really valid) example has:
<blockquote><code><nowiki><div class="g-plusone" data-size="tall" ... ></div></nowiki></code></blockquote>

== History ==
=== 2017 Removal of share counts ===
In mid-2017, Google removed the share count from "+1" buttons.

=== Google IO 2013 motivation ===
At [[Google IO 2013]], in the "Google+ Platform Overview" session, the Google presenters said that one motivation to add +1 buttons to your pages is that Google search results show who +1'd a post.

However, Google has since (2014? 2015?) dropped that aspect of Google search results, which no longer show who +1'd a post, whether you're logged into Google+ or not.
