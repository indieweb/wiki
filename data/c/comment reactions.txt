'''<dfn>comment reactions</dfn>''' are a feature of several [[silos]] that allow users to tap a hollow heart or other affordance next to [[comments]] on [[posts]] to [[like]] a specific comment or sometimes react with a limited set of [[reacji]].

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] was perhaps the first to provide the ability for people to [[like]] (üëçüèª) comments displayed on posts, eventually expanding to allow a specific set of [[reacji]].

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] has allowed users to react to comments on [[issue]]s and [[pull request]]s for quite some time with a limited set of [[reacji]] that they expanded a bit over time.

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] implemented the ability to [[like]] (‚ù§Ô∏è) comments on posts sometime after ~2019.

=== Strava ===
[[Strava]] experimented a bit with various icons and settled on an initially empty heart (‚ô°) similar to Instagram as an affordance which turns into a deep red orange heart (üß°) the same color as the Strava logo, since 2022-07. Unlike other silos, once "liked" you cannot unlike a comment.
