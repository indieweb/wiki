'''<dfn>Challenges</dfn>''' refer to obstacles, problems, or barriers that individuals face with setting up, using, and/or maintaining indieweb sites and their [[projects]]. 

== Why ==
As more and more of us make strides on our indieweb sites and [[projects]], it may help to keep track of challenges and difficulties, both that we ourselves encounter even as we make progress, and by those who either gave up on their indieweb sites, or find current challenges insurmountable.

== Citations Needed ==
To minimize handwaving and theoretical complaints, we should keep this page focused on documenting challenges that are serious enough that those encountering them have written about them openly on the web, providing citations thereto.

Document challenges by the year they're written about. Noting their timeframe will help us understand them in a historical context, especially as old challenges are overcome, and new challenges are encountered.

== Citations to process ==

I think even just the way their [[Getting_Started|“Getting Started” page]] is presented is an enormous barrier. A layperson’s eyes will 100% glaze over before they need to scroll. There is a lot of [[selfdogfood|weird jargon]] and in-joking. I don’t know how to fix that either. Even as someone with a reasonably technical background, there are a lot of [[backfeed|components]] of IndieWeb that intimidate me.</blockquote> (inline links from original)
** The '''[[new home page]]''' project will/should help solve some [[Getting Started]] challenges, likely enough to greatly simplify the [[Getting Started]] page itself. -— <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://tantek.com/logo.jpg}} [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]]</span> 17:16, 20 May 2021 (PDT)
** '''[[selfdogfood]]'''("weird jargon") ''is'' problematic as a term/phrase, for many reasons, and while not technical jargon, is still [[OSS]] jargon of a sort and thus we've replaced it as a [[principle]] with [[eat what you cook]]. That being said, there are likely many pages that still say "selfdogfood" that need copy editing and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/selfdogfood|need relinking]]. — <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://tantek.com/logo.jpg}} [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]]</span> 17:16, 20 May 2021 (PDT)
** '''[[backfeed]]'''("components") needs a more approachable and user-desirable definition that provokes a sense of the benefites of backfeed, staying in touch with [[responses]] from your friends on [[social media]]. — <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://tantek.com/logo.jpg}} [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]]</span> 17:16, 20 May 2021 (PDT)
