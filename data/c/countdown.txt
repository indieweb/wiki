'''<dfn>countdown</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn>timer</dfn>) is like an [[event]] post, often inside a [[story]] like on [[Instagram]], that has an end datetime, displays the number of days hours minutes seconds remaining, sometimes allowing viewers of the post to “Remind me” when the countdown finishes and receive a [[push notification]] accordingly; an IndieWeb countdown post could remind the author via push notification or potentially any reader who opts-in via [[Webmention]].

== Why ==
There are many use-cases for countdown posts on your own site:
* start the countdown on one device (laptop) and receive a push notification on another ([[smart watch]]), perhaps later when walking around and you’re away from the keyboard / your laptop.
* countdown post for a [[live video]] that others may want to be reminded of.
* (semi-)automatic countdown post for any [[event]] or [[RSVP]] post to remind of you that the event is starting
** option: reminder 10min before the countdown completes / event starts.

== Other Examples ==
* Chat example: [[Loqi]] will respond to a text-based expression of the form "(number) (time unit) until name-or-label-for-countdown" with a confirmation with countdown ID, allow canceling that countdown by ID, and upon finishing without cancellation, announce the name-or-label-for-countdown in chat.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Instagram]]’s [[story]] posts can have a countdown with datetime and label that followers can ask to be reminded of and subsequently receive a [[push notification]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== prototype as special event ===
{{t}} brainstorm: prototype a countdown post as a special kind of virtual [[event]] post where anyone can [[RSVP]], and if they RSVP 'yes', then automatically reply to their RSVP with a text [[reply]] like "Countdown (label) finished!" and then leave it up to their site to decide whether to turn that webmention into a push notification or not.
=== notify before completion ===
* Options: opt-in to receiving [[push notification]]s when the countdown finishes, or perhaps 5 or 10 minute before as well.
