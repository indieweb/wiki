'''<dfn>countdown</dfn>''' is a post similar to an [[event]], often inside a [[story]] post like on [[Instagram]], that has an end datetime and displays the number of days hours minutes seconds until that datetime, sometimes with the ability for viewers of the post to opt-in to “Remind me” when the countdown finishes and receive a [[push notification]] accordingly; an IndieWeb countdown post could remind the author via a push notification or.
