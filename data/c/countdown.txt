'''<dfn>countdown</dfn>''' is a post similar to an [[event]], often inside a [[story]] post like on [[Instagram]], that has an end datetime and displays the number of days hours minutes seconds until that datetime, sometimes with the ability for viewers of the post to opt-in to “Remind me” when the countdown finishes and receive a [[push notification]] accordingly; an IndieWeb countdown post could remind the author via a push notification or.

* Silo Examples: [[Instagram]] [[story]] posts can have a countdown with datetime and label.
* Brainstorm: prototype a countdown post as a special kind of virtual event post where anyone can RSVP, and if they RSVP 'yes', then automatically reply to their RSVP with text [[reply]] like "Countdown (label) finished!" and then leave it up to their site to decide whether to turn that webmention into a push notification or not.
* Use-case: countdown post for a [[live video]] that others may want to be reminded of.
* Use-case: (semi-)automatic countdown post for any [[event]] or [[RSVP]] post to remind of you that the event is starting
* Options: opt-in to receiving [[push notification]]s when the countdown finishes, or perhaps 5 or 10 minute before as well.
* Chat example: [[Loqi]] will respond to a text-based expression of the form "(number) (time unit) until name-or-label-for-countdown" with a confirmation with countdown ID, allow canceling that countdown by ID, and upon finishing without cancellation, announce the name-or-label-for-countdown in chat.
