{{stub}}

a '''<dfn>crawler</dfn>''' is a program that systematically browses the web.

== Use Cases ==

=== Identity consolidation ===

A crawler can be used to dereference one's identity graph by following all rel=me links.

==== 2018 Summer Crawl ====

{{angelo}} wrote a basic crawler to crawl the indieweb starting with known hcards previously found in the indiemap crawl.
Individual identities were consolidated, rel=me's were followed and [[PageRank]] was used to approximate the "primary" profile.
