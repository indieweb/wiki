{{stub}}

a '''<dfn>crawler</dfn>''' is a program that systematically browses the web

== Use Cases ==

=== [[webmention]] ===

When receiving a webmention the simplest case is grabbing the mentioning resource. There are additional resources one may want to fetch and cache for a more robust experience:

* other people introduced into the discussion through this source

=== [[nicknames-cache]] ===

When fetching and caching a contact the simplest case is grabbing their homepage. There are additional resources one may want to fetch and cache for a more robust experience:

* photo
* PGP key
* u-url, rel=me
** identity consolidation
** auto-contextualize nickname upon syndication
* rel=feed
** recommended subscriptions
* rel=next, rel=prev
** backfilling a subscription

Combinations are possible. A recommendation to subscribe to a feed on a distant but related profile. Photos from related profiles to contextualize the appropriate photo for the mention.

==== Identity Consolidation ====

A crawler can be used to fetch one's identity graph by following all rel=me links.

===== 2018 Summer Crawl =====

{{angelo}} wrote a basic crawler to crawl the indieweb starting with known h-cards previously found in the indiemap crawl.
Individual identities were consolidated, rel=me's were followed and [[PageRank]] was used to approximate the "primary" profile.

=== [[hashtag-cache]] ===

When stumbling upon a tag, whether it's an actual [[hashtag]] in a note or a u-category associated with an h-card, fetching and caching the resource referenced by the tag can provide a contextual cue as to its meaning.

==== Idea/Concept Consolidation ====

A crawler can be used to fetch a tag's meaning by following all rel=alternate links.

You can then use this list to assign some or all of them as your own rel=alternate's.

The resulting concept graph could serve as the basis for a [[decentralized-chat]].

== User Agent ==

Crawlers usually accompany their requests with a descriptive User-Agent header. This value can then be used in a [[robots_txt]] file to suggest access control. A crawler can always reuse a typical browser User-Agent to simulate a normal user instead. Thus User-Agent should not be relied upon for accuracy.
