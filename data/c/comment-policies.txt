This page is an attempt to collect peoples' comment policies on their personal sites.

== Sites Implementing [[comment#How_To|How To Comment]] ==
Ideally, indieweb sites should follow IndieWeb [[comment#How_To|How To Comment]] best practices for both making comments and accepting comments.

== IndieWebCamp Community Members ==
People that have attended an IndieWebCamp, and/or are active on #indiewebcamp [[IRC]] and their content commenting policies:

=== [http://aaronparecki.com/communication-protocols#commenting aaronparecki.com] ===
<blockquote>The best way to respond to something I've written is to post on your own site.

However, I will also read comments left on

* a Flickr photo
* Github
* a Foursquare checkin

I will probably ignore comments left on

* youtube
* last.fm
* myspace
</blockquote>

Also each post links to a syndicated version on Twitter with the text "Reply on Twitter"

=== [https://brennannovak.com/notes/231 brennannovak.com] ===
<blockquote>Reply via Twitter</blockquote> 

== Personal Sites ==
Others with indie web sites (let's get these folks to join [[IRC]] and attend a future IndieWebCamp!) and their content comment policies:

=== [http://www.toolness.com/wp/2013/01/on-enforcing-mandatory-code-review/ toolness.com] ===
<blockquote>If you'd like to respond, just tweet @toolness.</blockquote>

=== [http://seansperte.com/about seansperte.com] ===
<blockquote>Until March 2012 I allowed and welcomed comments from readers. I got tired of fighting comment spam and styling comments and forms every time I redesigned. I still welcome (and appreciate) feedback via email or Twitter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is important to remember that this is my website and I decide what I will feature. Commenting here is a privilege, not a right. There are many other sites on the Internet where you can express your viewpoint. I do not owe you space on mine.</blockquote>
