{{warning|This page is new and an attempt to incorporate a bunch of discussions happening on the [[discuss#meta|indieweb-meta chat channel]]}}

'''<dfn>IndieWeb community guidelines</dfn>''' are advice, tips, and a loose collection of emergent norms in the IndieWeb community beyond the [[code-of-conduct]] — new community members should read through these to get a better sense of how to participate harmoniously in shared IndieWeb spaces such as the [[discuss|chat channels]] and virtual Zooms ([[HWC]], [[Pop-ups]], [[FrESH]], and any others shared in chat).

== Brainstorming ==
{{section-stub}}
Putting the Brainstorming section first on this page to better indicate its fresh & in-development state.

There’s a bunch of brainstorming on community guidelines and norms that folks in the IndieWeb community are working on writing up:
* [[User:Crystaltouchton.com/community norms]]
* {{t}}: https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2025-12-19/1766188153137900 <blockquote>I have been looking at other community's norms as well, e.g. 32-bit cafe has this: https://discourse.32bit.cafe/guidelines</blockquote> I think we should include the section "Participating in the Community" https://discourse.32bit.cafe/guidelines#p-4-participating-in-the-community-4 and further sections in IndieWeb community guidelines as well
* ...

== Topics to Avoid ==
{{section-stub}}
This section is here to help guide folks to avoid (self-moderate) mild chat anti-patterns that have popped up from time to time, and provide a convenient place to link folks rather than have to explain it every time. Style note: name subsections with "Avoid ..." so when people link to them the fragment has a complete summary directive like <code>#Avoid_Technology_Rants</code>.

Even though we have informal chat channels (like [[discuss#random]]), there are a number of topics which have come up repeatedly and which community members have repeatedly expressed a desire to not take up time and space in the community. Most of these topics have other plenty of other outlets/venues/forums on the internet  for self-expression for folks that wish to engage in such discussions.

=== Avoid Technology Rants ===
The IndieWeb community chat has an overall positive and constructive culture, in particular on topics directly relating to the independent web and empowering each other, and we’d like to keep it that way.

Technology media (and [[social media]] in general) tend to be dominated by negative articles and posts.

This guideline is a request to avoid general technology-related rants in our on-topic channels. Typically we have seen this sort of thing about whatever technology topic is attracting the most hype, currently generative AI (e.g. [[LLM]]s) or BigTech in general, and previously topics like “[[metaverse]]”, [[cryptocurrency]], and [[blockchain]].

Lots about technology and its impact on society can be frustrating, and there’s obviously a lot of sympathy for that in the community because we are trying to make a better web, using our own websites as exemplars.

Instead of our on-topic channels, a better outlet for technology rants (if you feel compelled to share or vent or find others who feel similarly) about such topics is the [[discuss#random|#random channel]], or even better write up a thoughtful critique on your own blog!

We have a very constructively focused community, so another approach is to reconsider any general technology rant in terms of questions like:
* How does this affect my personal experience on the web, and how would I like it to be instead?
* How can I use my personal site as an alternative (or solution!) to such technological problems?
* What could I create to help solve such a technological problem?

If you discover other ways or reframing rants into constructive thoughts and words, please share!
