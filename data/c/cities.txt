== Brainstorming ==
=== Maps ===
Maps would be nice!
* All cities that have hosted HWCs or IWCs (maybe with a count of each on each city?)
* Recent cities (this calendar year or last year)
* All cities in a year (highlight new cities that year)

=== Timeline Charts ===
Timeline charts would be cool too! Designed like rockband member timelines:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestral_Manoeuvres_in_the_Dark#Timeline
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones#Timeline
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(band)#Timeline
* ... Is there a Wikipedia category for bands with timelines of members?

Charts:
* IndieWebCamps over time, horizontal axis measured by year
** Each new city added as a bar from bottom (closest to timeline base) to top, starting with Portland, etc.
** Cities with one IWC per year drawn as a contiguous line, missing a year shows a gap for that year
* Homebrew Website Clubs / IndieWeb meetups over time, horizontal axis measured by month/year
** Each new city added as a bar from bottom (closest to timeline base) to top, starting with San Francisco, etc.
** Cities with at least one HWC/IWM per month drawn as contiguous line, missing a month shows a gap for that month
