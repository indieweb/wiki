{{stub}}

'''<dfn>conneg</dfn>''' is short for HTTP Content Negotiation, a method by which a browser or other web client can request content of various types from a web server, and depending on what is requested, and what the server supports, it tries to provide the best it can.

== Caching ==
Content negotiation can pose additional challenges when trying to add caching layers, such as [[nginx]]'s fastcgi or proxy cache. Unless the cache key takes into account the requested content type of the content, the wrong representation may be returned by the cache.

== Tools ==
* [[Go]] library: https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/content-negotiation-go
