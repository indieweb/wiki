{{stub}}

'''<dfn>context</dfn>''' is everything around and about something, typically the nearer the more relevant, such as the graphic design surrounding a post, information around a post like the [[reply-context]] for a reply or its longer thread and previous discussions on the subject, posts by an author (perhaps of the same type) before and after a particular post, or conditions around a post like [[location]], [[weather]], date, and time of day.
