{{stub}}

'''<dfn>context</dfn>''' is everything around and about something, typically the nearer the more relevant, such as the graphic design surrounding a post, information around a post like the [[reply-context]] for a reply or its longer thread and previous discussions on the subject, posts by an author (perhaps of the same type) before and after a particular post, or conditions around a post like [[location]], [[weather]], date, and time of day.


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} has been using the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] to add [[reply-context]]s to his [https://boffosocko.com site] (especially for replies, bookmarks, reads, watches, listens) since ????-??-??. He uses the [[Simple Location plugin]] to frequently add [[weather]] and [[location]] related context to his posts since ????-??-??. 


== Other Examples ==
* [[LiveJournal]] has functionality in their post entry for adding [[location]], [[mood]] and [[music|listen]] data. see documentation at: https://www.livejournal.com/support/faq/32.html
It also has the ability to do [www.livejournal.com/support/faq/64.html custom mood themes].
