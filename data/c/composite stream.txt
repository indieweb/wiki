A '''<dfn>composite stream</dfn>''' is a [[stream]] that interleaves multiple types of [[posts]], such as [[notes]] and [[articles]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Previous Examples ===
* [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] using [[Ferocity]] on http://tommorris.org Until ~2016 at least, then site difficulties, [https://tommorris.org/posts/2018/quietism/ relaunched in 2018] with a uniform stream of named posts (resembling articles)
** [[notes]], [[articles]], [[checkins]]

* [[User:Eschnou.com]] - https://eschnou.com/ - Was until ~2016 maybe? As of 2021-02-17 home page has no stream, is more of an about page.
** [[notes]], [[articles]], ... ?

* {{kylewm}} on kylewm(.)com until ~2016? (domain appears to be hijacked as of 2021-02-17)
** [[notes]], [[articles]], [[photos]], [[reposts]], and especially good [[replies]] and [[checkins]]

* {{ bret }} on http://bret.io until ~2016? (homepage appears to be a link gallery now, not a stream)
** Full content: [[notes]], [[articles]], (subset of) [[bookmarks]], [[videos]], [[replies]], [[photos]]

== IndieWeb Interest ==
The following IndieWeb community members have expressed interest in implementing a composite stream:

* [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]]
* [[User:kartikprabhu.com]]
* ...

== Articles ==
Articles about composite streams, their evolution from a design perspective, etc.
* http://www.dailydot.com/business/origin-tumblr-anarchaia-projectionist-david-karp/
** worth further analysis, and documentation thereof, e.g. explicit design choices made in creating a composite stream vs. just a series of blog posts, both in terms of posting UI, and presentation of the composite stream.
