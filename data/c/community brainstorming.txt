'''<dfn>Community brainstorming</dfn>''' are ideas and suggestions for improving the IndieWeb [[community]], whether in-person, online in chat or virtual meetups, other discussions, or development and coding projects.

== Ideas for Ways to Meet Others in the IndieWeb ==
* '''Friday Night Online Hangout''' - {{tracydurnell}} suggests: I used to organize "Sip n Sketch" hangouts (irl), and have done some kinda craft night Discord hangouts with friends during the pandemic, and could see something like a "Craft and Chat" (better name plz) unstructured casual hangout where people work on something fun (could be analog or digital) and shoot the breeze could be a place to talk about stuff other than just websites and get to know people better, potentially a lower barrier to entry for newbies?
* '''IndieWeb Community Page / Directory''' - {{tracydurnell}} suggests: something like https://nownownow.com/ that serves as an opt-in profile for people who count themselves part of the IndieWeb, which could show an avatar or portrait, chosen name / chat name and link to their website - would it be technically possible to create the page content using webmentions, where to add your name to the listing you just post a reply to the page and replies are styled attractively in the css? I'm thinking people.indieweb.org ;)
