    '''<dfn>calendar heatmap</dfn>''' is a 2-dimensional calendar view that shows a value over time through color coding it, often with warmer colors indicating higher values (hence heatmap). 

== Silo Examples ==
=== GitHub ===
The contribution graph on [[Github]] user profiles uses light green to dark green to indicate level of contribution per day, on a 52x7 grid display of the most recent 52 weeks of contributions.

You can click on any of the squares and GitHub will show the contribution activity for that day below.
