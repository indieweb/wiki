You can click on any of the squares and GitHub will show the contribution activity for that day below.

=== JetPack ===
The [https://wordpress.org/mobile/ WordPress.com mobile app] (utilizing [[JetPack]] for self-hosted sites) has an Insights section with a Posting Activity pane with data spanning two months to indicate how frequently one post to their website.
