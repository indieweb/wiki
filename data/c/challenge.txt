A '''<dfn>challenge</dfn>''' on the indieweb can either mean a blogging challenge, a list of questions to answer or a topic to write about in a post, sometimes tagged/invited by others to do so, or an ongoing event-like post which invites people to post achievements towards a goal for a specific time period, like [[exercise]] or [[photo challenge|posting photos at some frequency]] (daily), also supported by silos like [[Strava]] and [[micro.blog]].

== Blogging Challenges ==
A blogging challenge is typically a call for a single post on a topic or to answer a series of questions.
See these individual pages for IndieWeb Examples of each.
