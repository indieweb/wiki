This page is for documenting examples of liberally licensed conference "Code of Conduct" pages that we  can keep in mind as we craft and iterate the IndieWebCamp [[code-of-conduct]].

== Examples ==
Most liberally licensed first.
=== CC0 ===
CC0 codes of conduct provide the maximum flexibility for re-use.

'''Positively framed and community empowering:'''
* [[code-of-conduct|IndieWebCamp Code of Conduct]] - IndieWebCamp's code of conduct is naturally licensed CC0 like the rest of the wiki.
* [http://www.yesandyesyes.com/code-of-conduct Yes and Yes Yes: Code of Conduct] - based on IndieWebCamp's code of conduct!
* [https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/ W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct]
