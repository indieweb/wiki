'''<dfn>card catalog</dfn>''' is a way to keep track of books or other media in a library, including a [[personal library]], typically physical media and sometimes also including digital items.

== Barcode Scanners ==
For quickly creating a [[personal library]] and/or acquiring data from a variety of services, below are some services which have apps or bar code scanners that will allow you to scan the ISBN bar codes on many books (typically those published after 1973) to import them into digital collections and/or print them out on physical cards. Most of these also have reasonably functional import/export of data for potential use with your personal website.

* [[Open Library]] has a browser-based, mobile-friendly barcode scanner in beta at: https://openlibrary.org/barcodescanner
* [[LibraryThing]] apps available at https://www.librarything.com/more
** LibraryThing also allows one to add personal barcodes to their books to cross link their physical library to their digital one. See https://www.librarything.com/settings/barcodes as well as their customizable printed bar code stickers which use common [https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Code_39 Code 39] barcodes: https://www.librarything.com/more/store/barcodes
* [[Goodreads]] https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-scan-books-on-iOS-and-Android
* Zotero, an open source bibliographic software has web shortcuts and an app for scanning barcodes: https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/76471/scanning-isbn-barcode-to-input-books-to-zotero-library


== Brainstorming ==
{{section-stub}}
=== Tantek ===
{{t}}: considering things we discussed in the [[2025/SD/cardcatalogs|IndieWebCamp SD cardcatalogs session]], the following seem worth exploring when creating a personal card catalog, either physical, or digital, or a design shared across physical and digital spaces.
* what would a plain text format / layout for a physical card catalog card look like? 
* QR codes on the physical cards that link to the virtual cards?
* any prior art like a card catalog HyperCard stack? 
* ...

==== minimum viable card fields ====
minimum viable card catalog card:
* author(s), title, date of acquisition, 
* scan barcode on the book to get most of these things (using [[Library Thing]] or [[Goodreads]], which gives you exportable database)
* you may not need heavy cataloging of your stuff

==== physical card design ====
From [[2025/SD/cardcatalogs]]:
* 1: author(s) on top line, above the horizontal redline, starting at the first vertical red line
* 2: title second line, below the horizontal redline, starting at the second vertical red line
* 3: publisher, publish location (city), year of publication (newer books day and date)
* 4: edition (1st, 2nd, ...), printing (number) of that edition (10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = first printing, 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 = second printing), hardcover or softcover or paperback or trade edition
* 5: pages and size (preface matter xliv for number of pages before page 1), number of numbered pages, measurement in cm of height of book
* 6: tracking numbers if exist in the book: ISBN, LoC (year + 6-7 digit number), LOC classification, Dewey Decimal classification
* 7: acquisition date, place paid for it, where purchased, condition purchased (new, good, very good, excellent, poor)

** "Thinking about the current storage capacity of my card index collection, I made a back-of-the-index-card calculation:  172,000 index cards * 150 words / card [average maximum, using front only] * 1,200 bytes / 150 words [rough average with Unicode encoding] * 1 kb / 1024 bytes * 1MB/1024 kb = approximately 200 MB of text storageHaving it well organized and indexed… Priceless."
