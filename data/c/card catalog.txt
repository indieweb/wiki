== Brainstorming ==

=== Tantek ===
{{t}}: considering things we discussed in the [[2025/SD/cardcatalogs|IndieWebCamp SD cardcatalogs session]], the following seem worth exploring when creating a personal card catalog, either physical, or digital, or a design shared across physical and digital spaces.
* what would a plain text format / layout for a physical card catalog card look like? 
* QR codes on the physical cards that link to the virtual cards?
* any prior art like a card catalog HyperCard stack? 
* ...

==== minimum viable card fields ====
minimum viable card catalog card:
* author(s), title, date of acquisition, 
* scan barcode on the book to get most of these things (using [[Library Thing]] or [[Goodreads]], which gives you exportable database)
* you may not need heavy cataloging of your stuff

==== physical card design ====
From [[2025/SD/cardcatalogs]]:
* 1: author(s) on top line, above the horizontal redline, starting at the first vertical red line
* 2: title second line, below the horizontal redline, starting at the second vertical red line
* 3: publisher, publish location (city), year of publication (newer books day and date)
* 4: edition (1st, 2nd, ...), printing (number) of that edition (10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = first printing, 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 = second printing), hardcover or softcover or paperback or trade edition
* 5: pages and size (preface matter xliv for number of pages before page 1), number of numbered pages, measurement in cm of height of book
* 6: tracking numbers if exist in the book: ISBN, LoC (year + 6-7 digit number), LOC classification, Dewey Decimal classification
* 7: acquisition date, place paid for it, where purchased, condition purchased (new, good, very good, excellent, poor)
