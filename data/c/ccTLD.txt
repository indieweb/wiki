{{stub}}

<dfn>ccTLD</dfn> is an abbreviation for <dfn>country code top-level domain</dfn>, a [[top-level-domain]] that is specific to a particular country, thus governed by its additional laws, and often more restrictive and/or fragile than non-country-specific domains; used by some in the IndieWeb community for [[short-domain]]s.

== Domains ==
=== as ===
.as is the [[wikipedia:en:.as|ccTLD for American Samoa]].

No IndieWeb folks are using .as short URLs.

Projects that support some IndieWeb [[building blocks]]:
* [[write.as]]

=== es ===
.es is the [[wikipedia:en:.es|ccTLD for Spain]] ('''Es'''paña).
Spain is one of several nations that issue digital personal identifiers to citizens ([[wikipedia:en:Documento Nacional de Identidad (Spain)|eDNI]]), and it is required to create a new domain. However, a Spanish citizen can transfer an existing domain to a noncitizen if that noncitizen can produce photo-ID from their own nation.
Can be useful for domain hacks. See: [[wiktionary:en:Category:English words suffixed with -es]].

IndieWeb folks using .es short URLs:

* {{arlo}}: arn.es (to be used for b.arn.es, arlo.james.b.arnes, arloj[U+40 COMMERCIAL AT]mesb.arn.es where 'mesb' obviously stands for "message board"... ;P [edit: I went with mes.b instead]), purchased for 100EUR from a friendly Spanish one-person-show domain broker.

=== eu ===
.eu is the [[wikipedia:en:.eu|ccTLD for the European Union]].

Registration is extremely cheap with many providers, however, those are usually only for the first year and is open for organisations and residents of EU member states.

Even though there are millions registered .eu domain, it's still awkward to tell people you have a website ending in .eu; it seems like the general public is either unaware of it's existence or they simply don't expect a personal site to be on a .eu domain. ''(Based on personal experience in Hungary and in the UK. -- {{petermolnar}} )''

* Brexit oops loss of .eu domains: https://twitter.com/dassurma/status/1348758505348595722
** "I lost access to a .eu domain i have because I used my UK address for the contact information. Apparently, since Jan 1st, UK citizens are not eligible for .eu domains anymore because #brexit.<br><br>🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️" [https://surma.dev @DasSurma] January 11, 2021

Past Examples:
* {{tonz}} - <nowiki>https://tzyl.eu</nowiki> redirects to default host index page as early as 2021-04-29.

=== gs ===
.gs is the [[wikipedia:en:.gs|ccTLD for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

There are no known content restrictions on .gs domains, and the [[wikipedia:en:South Georgia|South Georgia]] and the South Sandwich Islands South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) is a British overseas territory, thus we can consider it as stable as .uk domains.

IndieWeb folks using .gs short URLs:
* Jason Grigsby: http://gri.gs/

=== gy ===
.gy is the [[wikipedia:en:.gy|ccTLD for Guyana]].

IndieWeb uses of .gy short URLs:
* [[Bridgy]] proxy: http://brid.gy/

=== hr ===
.hr is the [[wikipedia:en:.hr|ccTLD for Croatia]], and controlled by CARNet, the academic and research network of Croatia.[https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-11-28/line/1448756662980]

* https://www.dns.hr/portal/register

Croatian private citizens can use their ID number (OIB) to register a single free .from.hr domain containing their full name. Free Wordpress hosting is also offered, but as it doesn't allow installing or enabling any plugins, this is currently unsuitable for IndieWeb. Businesses can likewise register a single free .hr domain, provided it contains the registered name of the business or an abbreviation thereof.

A begginer-friendly guide through the (fairly obvious) process can be found at:

* https://from.hr

Examples:
* http://damjan-novak.from.hr - stub

=== im ===
.im is the [[wikipedia:en:.im|ccTLD for the Isle of Man]].

IndieWeb uses of .im short URLs:
* [[User:bear.im|Bear]]: bear.im

Like .io, .im is rather expensive. The registrar is fairly easy to use but the number of resellars for .im are limited so people often use secondary nameserver services like FreeDNS to resolve their domain.

=== io ===
[[wikipedia:en:.io|.io is the ccTLD for British Indian Ocean Territory]].

Experiences with .io?

.io is comparatively expensive ($39 on gandi.net at the time of writing), but easy to set up, and perhaps valuable as a novelty TLD for IndieWeb purposes because of IO's input/output double meaning. There are no known administrative problems establishing .io domains.

The .io TLD has been criticized for generating profits for the British government instead of the people of the Indian Ocean Territory (unlike other [[ccTLD]]s for small island nations like .me or .tv).<blockquote>"[P]rofits from the sale of each .io domain flow to the very force that expelled the Chagossian or Ilois people from their equatorial land just a generation or two ago: the British government."</blockquote>from [https://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal The dark side of .io: How the U.K. is making web domain profits from a shady Cold War land deal].

IndieWeb folks using .io short URLs as their primary site:
* werd.io: Ben Werdmuller
* bret.io: Bret Comnes
* {{cleverdevil}}
** https://cleverdevil.io/pages/dot-io-supporting-chagos
as a secondary / utility site:
* p3k.io: {{aaronpk}} - and subdomains quill.p3k.io, monocle.p3k.io, but is moving these to .app domains over time, e.g. xray.p3k.app

=== is ===
.is is the [[wikipedia:en:.is|ccTLD for Iceland]].

* <s>As of 2015 it costs $250 to renew!</s>
** In 2021 it cost me €20.90 to renew gurdy.is, and I’m not aware of it ever having cost significantly more than that. Perhaps it depends on the length of the domain, and shorter ones are more expensive? or perhaps a middleman was marking up the price? — [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] ([[User talk:Waterpigs.co.uk|talk]]) 13:46, 20 May 2021 (PDT)
** $250 was a guess based on my fuzzy recollection, not sure what the actual number was, but it was exorbitant [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]

Past Examples:
* erinjo.is: {{erinjo}} (until late 2015)

=== ly ===
.ly is the [[wikipedia:en:.ly|ccTLD for Libya]].

.ly domains are [[wikipedia:en:.ly#Registration|subject]] to content restrictions, including but not limited to "obscene and indecent names/phrases, including words of a sexual nature" and "may not contain words/phrases or abbreviations insulting religion or politics, or be related to gambling and lottery industry or be contrary to Libyan law or Islamic morality."

The [[wikipedia:en:Libya#Government and politics|Libyan government]] is a dictatorship and "the most censored country in the Middle East and North Africa". In addition, [[wikipedia:en:2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] is an ongoing armed civil war.

There has been at least one case of a .ly domain name seizure / shutdown based on content restrictions:
* '''vb.ly was shut down 2010 September/October'''.
** 2010-10-06 [http://techyum.com/2010/10/official-vb-ly-link-shortener-seized-by-libyan-government/ Official: vb.ly Link Shortener Seized by Libyan Government]
** 2010-10-06 [http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/2010/10/the-ly-domain-space-to-be-considered-unsafe/ The .ly domain space to be considered unsafe]

For these reasons we recommend you AVOID USING ANY/ALL .LY domains, both for your own URLs, and linking to.

Alternatives:
* bit.ly/*** — use j.mp/*** links instead

=== me ===
.me is the [[wikipedia:en:.me|ccTLD for Montenegro]].

There are no known content restrictions on .me domains, and the [[wikipedia:en:Montenegro#Government and politics|government]] of Montenegro is a democracy.

.me domains can be registered through many major domain registrars. We suggest you get a recommendation from a friend.

Thus we consider .me domains to be reasonably stable.

College and university students can get a "free" .me domain from Namecheap (one year).

IndieWeb folks using .me short URLs:
* Ben Ward: http://benward.me
* {{t}}: http://ttk.me
* {{willnorris}}: https://wjn.me
* Ethan Yoo, whose last name is pronounced like the word "you," uses https://yooand.me and https://yoois.me
* ...

=== pk ===
.pk is the [[wikipedia:en:.pk|ccTLD for Pakistan]].

There are no known content restrictions on .pk domains, and the [[wikipedia:en:Pakistan#Politics|government of Pakistan]] is a democratic parliamentary federal republic.

.pk domains can be registered directly from [http://www.pknic.net.pk/ PKNIC] for $24 per year with a minimum registration of two years.

Updating the registrant info for a domain (transferring ownership, or even just updating the address or phone number of the same registrant) requires [http://pk6.pknic.net.pk/pk5/pgHelpUnlockDomain.PK sending a notarized letter] by mail to the registrar.

IndieWeb folks using .pk short URLs:
* Aaron Parecki: http://aaron.pk/

=== re ===
.re is the [[wikipedia:en:.re|ccTLD for Réunion]] (a French island).

IndieWeb folks using .re short URLs:
* Marty McGuire: http://mmg.re (see [[#mmg.re]])
* Arne Govaerts: https://q4.re

=== ro ===
.ro is the [[wikipedia:en:.ro|ccTLD for Romania]].

There are no known content restrictions on .ro domains, and there are no registration restrictions for second-level domains. The .ro domains can be registered directly from [http://www.rotld.ro/engleza/index en.html RoTLD] for $51.26, which is a one-time fee with no annual renewal fee at present. However, there is a note on the payment page that indicates they may charge an annual fee in the future. 

<blockquote>The registration is 51,26$+VAT(24%), one-time payment. There is no yearly fee at present. When yearly fee will be introduced, you will be informed.</blockquote>

No VAT is required when payment is sent in USD. If payment is sent by wire transfer, the wire transfer fees for sending and receiving are paid by the customer. The RoTLD bank does not charge a fee to receive USD as of 2011-03.

Payment must be made by wire transfer or by faxing a copy of your credit card and photo ID to the registrar.

IndieWeb folks using .ro short URLs:
* Amber Case, for her Cyborg Anthropology website: http://anth.ro since 2011-03
** As of 2013-09, [[2013/UK/Demos#Amber|recommends against getting a .ro domain]]

=== so ===
.so is the [[wikipedia:en:.so|ccTLD for Somalia]].

Issues:
* '''$102''' / year (?!?). As of 2015-05-28, the renewal fee increased to $102 (for a year) in at least [https://twitter.com/deewu/status/603988348584210432 one instance]: <blockquote>… my .so domain. Renewal fee going from $19 to $102.</blockquote>
* '''$99''' / year.

* '''2015-06-09 no more registrations'''. [https://twitter.com/deewu/status/603989592493170690 as noted]: <blockquote>No new registrations after June 9, 1 yr renewal periods afterwards, higher fees. …</blockquote>

=== tc ===
.tc is the [[wikipedia:en:.tc|ccTLD for the Turks and Caicos Islands]].

This TLD is going through pricing turmoil, raising prices from $50 to $120 per year in some cases.  The new manager of the registrar, [http://meridiantld.net/pricing/ Meridian TLD], is offering current domain owners a domain transfer and a year renewal for $44 USD, effectively forcing domain owners to change registrars.  More information on this racket can be found on the [https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/3-easy-steps-to-ruin-the-reputation-of-a-countrys-domain-extension.html iwantmyname.com blog.

Past Examples:
* <strike>Bret: http://bre.tc - I do not recommend this tld.  It has been nothing but pain and agony.</strike> using .io now.

=== uk ===
.uk is the [[wikipedia:en:.uk|ccTLD for the United Kingdom]].

Originally Nominet UK only allowed domains to be registered under certain subdomains, such as co.uk or org.uk. They have recently opened up the top-level domain itself. There is a potential difficulty in registering short domains though as people who have already registered the .co.uk variant get priority I believe.

'''Note''' The registrar requires that your WHOIS mailing address be a valid UK address, for details see [http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-domain-name/rules section 7.

=== us ===
.us is the [[wikipedia:en:.us|ccTLD for the United States]].

Registration is cheap, a couple dollars less than than .com. Registrants must be US citizens/organizations or foreign entities with a US presence. Aside from the registrant requirements...there are few controversies with .us compared to country based tlds.

IndieWeb folks using .us short URLs: 
* {{gwg}} uses di5.us as a short redirect for his main site, david.shanske.com, and runs projects on gwg.us
* {{colintedford}} uses cted.us as a short redirect for his main site, colintedford.com.

== Criticism ==
(this section is a stub, feel free to expand, e.g. with subsections)
* More restrictive content — some ccTLDs have content restrictions specific to that country
* Harder to acquire — some ccTLDs only allow residents and/or citizens of the specific country to register them
* ...
