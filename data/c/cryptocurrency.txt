Grifters can more easily exploit people’s fear of missing out on lucrative fads and get-rich-quick schemes, while money launderers use decentralized finance (DeFi) to conceal the origins of illicit gains from tax authorities.</blockquote>

=== "the most boring form of art ever created" ===


* '''Phineas Harper''': 2022-05-03:[https://www.dezeen.com/2022/05/03/nfts-digital-art-reddit-place/ There are far more radical forms of digital art than the cultural dead-end of NFTs]
<blockquote>Whether NFTs are here to stay or not, they are the most boring form of art ever created, centering value in nothing more than ownership.

Owning art is the least interesting aspect of art. A great artwork might be pioneering in its use of media, arresting in its formal composition, or rich with symbolism.</blockquote>

<blockquote>First, those best able to profit from the NFT bubble are those already in command of substantial followings, like the famous musicians Grimes, Eminem and Snoop Dogg, who all recently released lucrative NFT collections. If there is cash to be made from issuing tokens, it will mostly flow to the already wealthy few rather than the struggling many.

Second, minting an NFT is not free, requiring makers to buy into cryptocurrency exchanges at their own risk like a pyramid scheme. For all the designers who have successfully cashed in on the hype machine, many more will lose out, predominantly those least able to do so.

Above all, NFTs erode the most radical and adventurous aspect of the internet: sharing. Sharing is a nourishing act of solidarity, fundamentally more enjoyable and resource-efficient than the kind of private, solitary ownership that consumerism promotes.</blockquote>
