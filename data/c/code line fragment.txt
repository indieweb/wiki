{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>code line fragment</dfn>''' is an experimental way of linking to a part of a longer code snippet located at a specific url. Code line fragments are based on previous work on [[media fragment]]s and [[fragmentions]] as well as based on the way GitHub allows code line linking to Gists.

== Brainstorming ==
This is experimental so everything is currently just brainstorming. The idea is in the same way that you can link to a part of media using media fragments, you should be able to link to parts of code snippets. Using GitHub, you can link to sections of code by appending the url hash #L followed by the line number, and you can even choose a range by doing #L1-L5. Taking that previous art as inspiration, {{eddiehinkle.com}} has [https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/05/28/article/ implemented an experimental version of this on his website].
