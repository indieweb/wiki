The '''<dfn>corporate web</dfn>''' is perhaps more critically explained as the capitalist web, where people are the product, and their time, attention, and clicks are seen as a natural resource to be extracted and sold to the highest bidder. The most prominent part of the corporate web are [[social media]] [[silos]], driven by the web advertising business model, with algorithms that amplify divisive posts, designed to maximize ad views while driving apart families & friends, and polarizing entire countries.
