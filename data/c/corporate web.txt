The '''<dfn>corporate web</dfn>''' is perhaps more critically explained as the capitalist web, where people are the product, and their time, attention, and clicks are seen as a natural resource to be extracted and sold to the highest bidder. The most prominent part of the corporate web are [[social media]] [[silos]], driven by the web advertising business model, with algorithms that amplify divisive posts, designed to maximize ad views while driving apart families & friends, and polarizing entire countries.

=== Brain Drain on Society ===
The corporate web is a brain drain on society to slosh money around to distract people and show them things they don’t need: <blockquote>some of the best and brightest minds of our generation are working on how to get more people to click on ads</blockquote> from Max Bock’s [https://mxb.dev/blog/human-code/ Human Code], 2020-06-05.

** "Social media compete in an intense Darwinian arms race to attract advertising revenue. They do this by stimming your brain's dopamine receptors. Easiest way to do this is to push OUTRAGE! HATE! FEAR! messages which make you keep clicking. If news is a drug, Twitter/FB are heroin." [http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/ @cstross] June 15, 2020
