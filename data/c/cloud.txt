'''<dfn>cloud</dfn>''' in short means “other people's servers”, typically used for storage or computing, and for the IndieWeb, there some '''[[personal cloud]]''' solutions. Such "cloud computing" services are pitched (though rarely in practice) as providing online services that are on-demand, broadly available, elastic, and measured service.

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Characteristics|The National Institute of Standards and Technology's definition of cloud computing] for a more jargon-heavy definition and expansions.

== Cloud things ==
You might also be looking for:
* [[CloudFlare]]
* [[Cloudfront]]
* [[iCloud]]

== Building block vs apps ==
Sometimes these on-demand/self-service/elastic/measured cloud services are used for computing building blocks such as storage, computation, and server bandwidth.
* Examples: Amazon S3, EC2. Akamai.

The term "cloud" is also used to refer to such services which are applications themselves such as [[email]], [[blogging]], etc. which are almost always [[silos]] as well:
* Examples: [[gmail]] (barely cloud-like in that its storage capacity is slowly growing), [[Blogger]], [[Wordpress.com]]

== Relation to IndieWeb ==
* See [[personal cloud]]

== Misuse ==

=== just means internet or server ===
There many intentional and unintentional misuses of the word "cloud" in reference to "cloud computing" which do not meet the definition or criteria above in one or more ways. As such the following phrases can typically be substituted:

;"in the cloud"
:= on the internet
;"personal cloud"
:= personal (virtual) server

=== marketing and branding ===
As "cloud" is a more recent (and shorter/catchier) term than "server" or "internet" or "virtual host", there are also now commercial services which use "cloud" in the name of their service which do not actually provide cloud computing services.
