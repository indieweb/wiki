A '''<dfn>collection</dfn>''' is a type of [[post]] that explicitly lists and/or embeds multiple other posts chosen by the author. 

== How to markup ==
Currently, no readers or parsers really pay attention to collection posts, as such there is no official way on how to mark them up since markup needs a parsing use case. Current markup ideas can be seen in the [https://indieweb.org/collection#how_to_markup_2 Brainstorming section].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} uses [[Red Wind]] to publish collection posts on kylewm.com [http://kylewm.com/share/2014/04/14/1 since 2014-04-14]. Example:
* http://kylewm.com/share/2014/04/14/1 (marks up the items in the collection as <code>u-repost-of h-cite</code>)

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] to publish collection posts on aaronparecki.com [http://aaronparecki.com/collections/2014/08/14/1/ since 2014-08-14]. Example:
* https://aaronparecki.com/2017/01/12/14/webmention
* http://aaronparecki.com/collections/2014/08/14/1/ (broken in 2016 redesign)
__TOC__

=== Stephen Paul Weber ===
[[User:Singpolyma.net|singpolyma]] uses WordPress to publish collection posts on singpolyma.net Example:
* https://singpolyma.net/2016/01/disney-copyright-trademark/
=== hmans.io ===

=== Kongaloosh ===
{{kongaloosh}} has been publishing collection posts on  kongaloosh.com [http://kongaloosh.com since 2015/07/25]. Collections are responses to multiple posts on the site. So, an album of pictures would merely be in-response-to many image posts.
Example:
* http://kongaloosh.com/e/2015/7/25/albums

To better format albums {{Kongaloosh}} has also been publishing collections of images, or albums, since [http://kongaloosh.com since 2016/08/1]. Albums are collections of images with text associated with sub-groups of images.

=== Grant Richmond ===
{{grantcodes}} uses his [[PhotoPostr]] micropub client to create collections as albums.
Example:
* https://grant.codes/2017/09/26/59cab14adcb35c561bade757

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has a collection of posts about the IndieWeb: http://boffosocko.com/research/indieweb/

=== Dan Q ===
{{danq}} is retroactively producing summary "digests" represented by collections his posts of various kinds, grouped by month (or other time period). Example:
* https://danq.me/2018/08/31/digest-2018-august/

He's also looking into ways of improving machine- and human-readability of his archives and ways of "grouping" related content (e.g. [[checkin|checkins]] to a geohashpoint and the geocaches found along the way, an accompanying [[article]] describing the adventure on the whole, and a [[video]] vlog) - real examples of all of the above (without a single overarching collection at the time of writing) can also be found in the above digest.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Storify ===
[[Storify]] is a silo for collecting tweets ([[Twitter]] [[notes]]). Examples:
* https://storify.com/charlesarthur/oh-hai-sexism
* https://storify.com/jcolman/mike-monteiro-design-facebook
=== Twitter Moments ===
[[Twitter]] made Moment creation available to all users around 2o16-09-30.
Moments are collections of tweets with text and a [[featured]] imge, and can be added to once published.

=== Foursquare ===
[[Foursquare]] allows users to create lists of related venues, then they have a 'best of' which I suppose is a collection of collections

== Changes ==
Collections can change over time but typically don't change often. Changes to collections typically consist of additions, rarely is something removed from a collection. Things may be added to the collection in a specific location within the collection, since the order of the items in the collection is significant.

Changes might be reflected by update posts, e.g. the photos that have been added to a set or notification of a correction to a post.

== Different from a feed ==
[[feed|Feeds]] are typically automatically-generated sets of date-ordered posts where the set changes often, new posts showing up at the top of the feed, and old posts dropping off.

== Brainstorming ==
=== pull request ===
{{main|edit#Lightweight_Pull_Request}}
A pull request post could be modeled as a collection post of [[edit]] posts of individual files.

=== how to markup ===
The prevailing idea on marking up collection posts is that a collection is an h-entry that contains children h-entries. Any properties on the top-level h-entry are seen to apply to the collection as a whole, whereas properties on the child h-entries are seen to apply to their individual posts. Each child post should have it's own permalink (or else it's not considered a collection). This allows someone to send a webmention to either the collection as a whole or to individual post on the collection.

This markup method is followed by {{aaronpk}} and {{grantcodes}}.

=== Post Type Discovery ===

{{grantcodes}} has implemented collection [[post type discovery]] into his own site by simply adding a check for children, after checking for in-reply-to
