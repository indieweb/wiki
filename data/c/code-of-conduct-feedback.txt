Feedback on the IndieWebCamp [[code-of-conduct]].

== Open Discussions ==
=== Burden is in the wrong place ===

The tl;dr says:

<blockquote>respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered</blockquote>

This places the burden on the person who is being bothered, which in many cases is not appropriate. While this can work for specific instances, and may make sense in the case of online communication, we should make it clear that we are not expecting people to deal with their own problems at events. <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://aaronparecki.com/images/profile.jpg}} [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 16:46, 26 June 2019 (PDT)

=== Contact Information ===
* The CoC doesn't give explicit contact information for victims of abuse and harassment. We should add one (or a few).
** There's an issue with the first point, the contact information. The contact information is going to differ depending on where in the community the behaviour takes place. Behaviour taking place at an IRL event should really be referred to the organiser of the event or someone they nominate, behaviour on-wiki or on IRC can really only be resolved by someone with administrative/moderator powers in those spaces, while behaviour on, say, a Github issue that's on an associated project that has opted into the CoC would be better handled by the maintainer of that project. ——[[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris.org]] 06:24, 12 April 2016 (PDT)

=== Event Specific ===
* The CoC is, in some places, very event specific and doesn't speak non-events like the IRC/Slack channel and the GitHub repos. This was discussed at [2018/Organizers] and [/2018/NYC/Organizers]. CoC was changed to reflect online associated places. Behavior in non IndieWeb spaces was also discussed.  No resolution decided.

=== Data and Privacy Policy ===

In my opinion the CoC should have a section on expectations of data privacy. Something along the lines of any personal identifiable data collected in a private email or form submission should not be considered public by the community. This includes email used to collect attendance or distribute tickets for events.

Instead we encourage community members to encourage use of public guestbooks or check-ins to allow for attendees to network or find like minded individuals in the area.

Any collection of personal data should always be made explicit to attendees and everyone shoudl be given an opt-in rather than opt-out option,

* Not sure this belongs in CoC but I wouldn't want an attendee to have to find the HWC, IWC planning guide to find the privay policy. That is why CoC makes sense to me. I have no problem encouraging this conduct among organizers.


=== Political Orientation ===
* I propose that we add "political orientation" or something to that effect to the list of things. -- {{veganstraightedge}} 2013-02-15 10:14 PST
** This sounds reasonable. Is there a pre-existing phrase used by one of the [[code-of-conduct-examples]] that conceptually covers this? {{tantek}} 12:06, 15 February 2013 (PST)
*** None that I know of. (And I can't believe that this is two years old now?) {{veganstraightedge}} 2015-03-15 15:20 PST
**** Yup, was waiting for an answer to hopefully re-use a pre-existing phrase rather than making up our own. Since in 2+ years no one has found a pre-existing example, is this solving a non-problem? Anticipated problem? Or Under/unreported? {{tantek}} 15:45, 15 March 2015 (PDT)
*** [[Django]] code of conduct uses "political belief" [https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/] <blockquote>Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</blockquote> — <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/assets/img/profile.jpg}} [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> ([[User talk:Gregorlove.com|talk]]) 18:29, 16 June 2015 (PDT)
** Possibly relevant: the StrangeLoop conference uninvited Curtis Yarvin ("Mencius Moldbug") because of (odious) political writings [https://s3.amazonaws.com/sl-notes/yarvin.txt]. The organizer's rationale for excluding him was that it would be an unwelcome distraction from the technical content of the conference. It's worth considering what we would do... {{kylewm}} 18:05, 16 June 2015 (PDT)

=== Content Posted Outside the Community ===

Similar to the discussion of politics, above, and discussed around the [[2018/Organizers|2018 Organizers Summit]], among other times.

How does (or can) the CoC resolve issues where individuals may be following CoC at events, in IRC, etc., but they post content elsewhere that would violate CoC, contribute to systemic/historical dynamics of oppression, incite discrimination, etc.?

Some example policies from orgs and services for dealing with user-generated content that might offer some overlap or insight, along with similar writings about divisive content and how technology choices (like a focus on chat + wiki) can influence community outcomes:
