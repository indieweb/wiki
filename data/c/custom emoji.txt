'''<dfn>Custom emoji</dfn>''' are "picture characters" just like [[emoji]], but not from the standard unicode set but rather custom/user-provided. Sometimes, especially historically before standard Emoji became popular, also referred to as custom emoticons (e.g. in MSN Messenger in 2005).

== observed patterns ==
* included in conventional emoji picker inside the apps
* more common in chat software than (micro-)blogs
* emojis setup and use sometimes tied to membership in some community/channel/instance

== Examples ==
=== Fediverse ===
Various Fediverse projects support a common ActivityPub extension to include custom emoji as tags in messages: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Emoji (supported e.g. in [[Mastodon]] [https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/custom_emojis/], [[Pleroma]] [https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/frontend/user_guide/posting_reading_basic_functions/], [[GoToSocial]] [https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/admin/settings/#custom-emoji], [[PixelFed]] [https://pixelfed.github.io/docs-next/spec/ActivityPub.html#custom-emoji], Misskey [https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey-hub/blob/main/src/en/docs/features/custom-emoji.md])

They are (usually?) configured by the instance admin and made available in the posting UI through emoji picker and <code>:shortcodes:</code>. [https://emojos.santisbon.me/chaos.social This is a tool] to view the custom emoji configured on a specific instance (TODO: is there some general overview tool?)

They can also be used in display names for accounts.

==== Bridgy Backfeed ====
When receiving [[backfeed]] of replies to [[POSSE]]'d posts via [[bridgy]], it includes the custom emoji as inline images, linking to the custom emoji cache of your instance:

<pre>
<article class="h-entry">
[...]
  <div class="e-content p-name">
  
  <p>This is message text <img alt="<shortcode>" src="https://<instance-assets-domain>/cache/custom_emojis/images/XXX/YYY/ZZZ/original/<hash>.png" style="height: 1em"></p>
  </div>
[...]

  <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="<yourpost>"></a>
</article>
</pre>

If your comment display allows images, they will automatically work, but there is no 100% clear indication that an image is a custom emoji if you wish to filter for them (e.g. because you only want to allow them, but not other, not-inline-styled images).

==== Bridgy Fed ====
{{note|TODO: how are they received through bridgy fed? Can you post them through it?}}

=== Slack ===
Custom emoji can be configured in [[Slack]] per workspace and used in messages and in [[reacji]] inside that workspace.

=== Discord ===
Custom emoji can be configured in [[Discord]] per community and used in messages and [[reacji]] in that community. Use of animated custom emoji is restricted to paying users, as is the use of emoji from another community they are a member of.

=== Twitch ===
Twitch supports custom "Emotes" through the service, e.g. as a perk for channel subscribers (similar to discord, only subscribers can use them in other channels). In addition, there is a surprisingly large ecosystem of third-party integrations that add custom emoji outside the platform restrictions, through browser extensions, integration in streaming software.

=== MSN Messenger ===
Historic example, starting in 2005 with the release of MSN Messenger 7 according to [http://www.messengertools.net/Animated-MSN-Emoticons.html] - added to document a possible starting point, there's probably a lot more forgotten ones between this and the current examples

* Twitter popularized custom emoji starting in 2014 <blockquote>In 2014, Twitter introduced hashflags, special hashtags that automatically generate a custom emoji next to them for a certain period of time. Hashflags may be generated by Twitter themselves or be purchased by corporations.</blockquote> â€” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Posts. 
** Custom emoji as discussed in the other examples feel noticeably different, e.g. the integration through the picker just like normal emoji, per-community configuration. Hashflags to me seem more like special cases of hashtags to make them stand out more, not emoji-like in use.
