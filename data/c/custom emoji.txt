'''<dfn>Custom emoji</dfn>''' are "picture characters" just like [[emoji]], but not from the standard unicode set but rather custom/user-provided.


== Examples ==
=== Fediverse ===
Various Fediverse projects support a common ActivityPub extension to include custom emoji as tags in messages: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Emoji

They are (usually?) configured by the instance admin and made available in the posting UI through emoji picker and <code>:shortcodes:</code>. [https://emojos.santisbon.me/chaos.social This is a tool] to view the custom emoji configured on a specific instance (TODO: is there some general overview tool?)
==== Bridgy Backfeed ====
When receiving [[backfeed]] of replies to [[POSSE]]'d posts via [[bridgy]], it includes the custom emoji as inline images, linking to the custom emoji cache of your instance:

<pre>
<article class="h-entry">
[...]
  <div class="e-content p-name">
  
  <p>This is message text <img alt="<shortcode>" src="https://<instance-assets-domain>/cache/custom_emojis/images/XXX/YYY/ZZZ/original/<hash>.png" style="height: 1em"></p>
  </div>
[...]

  <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="<yourpost>"></a>
</article>
</pre>

If your comment display allows images, they will automatically work, but there is no 100% clear indication that an image is a custom emoji if you wish to filter for them (e.g. because you only want to allow them, but not other, not-inline-styled images).

==== Bridgy Fed ====
{{note|TODO: how are they received through bridgy fed? Can you post them through it?}}

=== Slack ===
Custom emoji can be configured in [[Slack]] per workspace and used in messages and in [[reacji]] inside that workspace.

== Discord ==
Custom emoji can be configured in [[Discord]] per community and used in messages and [[reacji]] in that community. Use of animated custom emoji is restricted to paying users, as is the use of emoji from another community they are a member of.
