** <blockquote><p>To count as being part of the web, your app or page must:</p><ol><li>Be linkable, and</li><li>Allow any client to access it.</li></ol></blockquote>
** <q>But links aren't the complicated part; it's the part where your thing should allow any client to access it. For the web, that rule is pretty clear: whether you use Chrome or Safari or Edge or Opera or whatever, when you click a link or type in a URL, you get the page you wanted (more or less). Those pages are agnostic to the client.</q>
