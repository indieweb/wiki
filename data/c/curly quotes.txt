{{stub}}
'''<dfn>curly quotes</dfn>''' are pairs of quote marks that are shaped with curves to indicate the start and end of a [[quotation]], like “” and ‘’, and should be used in prose content and [[posts]].

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
You should use curly quotes in prose content for improved typography and better readability around quotations and as apostrophes in contractions and possessives.

== How to ==
Different systems have different ways of entering curly quotes. You may find the following useful for copy/pasting:
<div style="font-size:400%">
* “ ”
* ‘ ’
</div>
