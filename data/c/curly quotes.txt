{{stub}}
'''<dfn>curly quotes</dfn>''' are pairs of quote marks that are shaped with curves to indicate the start and end of a [[quotation]], like “ ” and ‘ ’ , and should be used in prose content and [[posts]].

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
You should use curly quotes in prose content for improved typography and better readability around quotations and as apostrophes in contractions and possessives.

== How to ==
Different systems have different ways of entering curly quotes. You may find the following useful for copy/pasting:
<div style="font-size:600%;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:0.4em">
“ ”  &nbsp; ‘ ’
</div>
=== How to type ===
On MacOS, you can type curly quotes as follows:
* <kbd>“</kbd> — option-[
* <kbd>”</kbd> — shift-option-[ 
* <kbd>‘</kbd> — option-]
* <kbd>’</kbd> — shift-option-]

On browsers in general, you can create the following bookmarklets (curlypastelets or just pastelets) to choose and type the curly quotes you want:
