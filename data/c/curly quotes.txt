{{stub}}
'''<dfn>curly quotes</dfn>''' are pairs of quote marks that are shaped with curves to indicate the start and end of a [[quotation]], like “ ” and ‘ ’ , and should be used in prose content and [[posts]].

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
You should use curly quotes in prose content for improved typography and better readability around quotations and as apostrophes in contractions and possessives.

== How to ==
Different systems have different ways of entering curly quotes. You may find the following useful for copy/pasting:
<div style="font-size:600%;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:0.4em">
“ ”  &nbsp; ‘ ’
</div>
=== How to type ===
On MacOS, you can type curly quotes as follows:
* <kbd>“</kbd> — option-[
* <kbd>”</kbd> — shift-option-[ 
* <kbd>‘</kbd> — option-]
* <kbd>’</kbd> — shift-option-]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{jeremycherfas}} uses a [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/converting-straight-quotes-with-alfred home-made Python script in Alfred] to smartify quotes and em dashes when he writes
* {{t}} uses [[UTF-8]] in his content creation and publishing flow (from using BBEdit to create posts and UTF-8 plain text files, to PHP and JS handling of UTF-8 storage, to publishing HTML with UTF-8), and thus enters curly quotes directly when typing his content on MacOS laptop keyboard (as documented in [[#How_to_type]]. E.g.:

== Brainstorming ==
* a set of bookmarklets one for each curly quote so you can quickly select the one you want, curlypastelets or just pastelets
** {{gRegor}}: 2024-07-02 [https://gregorlove.com/2024/07/i-prefer-to-use/ my note] with the four bookmarklets I use
