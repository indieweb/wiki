{{stub}}

'''<dfn>curl -I</dfn>''' is a command line option for the [[curl]] command that takes no parameters and tells curl to retrieve the HTTP-header only using the HTTP HEAD command.

Equivalent in PHP for setting curl options in a <var>$c</var> variable:
* <code>curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_HEADER, true);</code>
