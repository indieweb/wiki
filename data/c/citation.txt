A '''<dfn>citation</dfn>''' is a reference to something (a way to look up what) someone said, wrote, or photographed/captured, typically a published work of some kind, these days often on the web.

Publishing a citation for material discussed in a [[article]], or that a [[reply]] is [[in-reply-to]], are also ways of explicitly and transparently [[giving-credit]] to sources.

== Why ==
You should publish citations so your readers can lookup the quotations or media you post from others, and evaluate such information for themselves.

You should both look for and check citations for quotations and media because so many quotations are false or misattributed, and so much media is [https://twitter.com/boredzo/status/1185775650025553920 altered, re-used for unrelated events], or otherwise misleading.

<blockquote>“PSA: If a photo, ostensibly of some recent event, does not come directly from a credible journalist or outlet and is not attributed to one, don’t trust it and don’t share it.<br><br>It could be edited, of a different event, selectively framed, or otherwise an attempt at manipulation.”<div style="text-align:right">[https://boredzo.org/ @boredzo], [https://twitter.com/boredzo/status/1185775650025553920 October 20, 2019]</div></blockquote>

== How to ==
=== How to markup ===
{{main|h-cite}}
How to <span id="Markup">markup</span> citations in your posts:

When publishing references to published works on the web, use the '''[[h-cite]]''' microformat to markup the '''name''' of the work, '''URL''', '''author''' (with embedded '''[[h-card]] ''name'', ''photo'', and ''URL'' '''), when '''published''', '''publisher''' (if any), when '''retrieved''' (optionally).

=== How to lookup ===
(this section is a stub and incomplete, please expand)

* Images:
** You can track the source of images through sites like tineye.com. Especially useful to detect if an old photo is presented as showing a recent event.

== IndieWeb Uses ==
There are several specific indieweb uses of citations.
* [[reply-context]] - a reply-context contains a citation for the original post that the reply is in-reply-to.
* [[comments-display]] - indieweb comments that have been syndicated from their original reply URLs into a "Comments" section on an original post are all ''references'' to original material, and thus are also citations.
* [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer sections]] - external references in footer sections (i.e. in addition to the abovementioned comments display section) are almost always also citations.

== User Interface ==
=== text input ===
A site can provide text inputs with a citation URL (and/or full citation markup) pre-filled in for the reader to copy / paste. IndieWeb Examples:
* {{tantek}} provides text inputs to copy the permalink and citation markup, e.g. bottom of http://tantek.com/2014/120/b1/markup-people-focused-mobile-communication
* [[User:Kartikprabhu.com|Kartik]] provides text inputs to copy permalinks on articles, e.g. bottom of https://kartikprabhu.com/article/indieweb-love-blog
* ...
=== Visual Input ===
* [[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T211243 Wikipedia visual editor citation prompt UI]]
** A editor can indicate to an author that a citation is missing. The author can then use a visual interface to add a citation. There is a parser built in to generate the citation.
<blockqoute>My team just deployed a feature that creates a dialogue on citation-needed tags to make visual addition of references via the autofill tool on @Wikipedia https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T211243<cite><a class="h-cite" href="https://twitter.com/iamjessklein/status/1187712670822215686">Jess Klein</a></cite></blockquote>
Silo examples:
* [[Trello#Card_share_UI|Trello' share and more UI]] has a text inputs to copy a [[permashortlink]] of the card, or blockquote markup to embed the card.
* ...

=== append to text selection copy ===
Using [[javascript]] it appears possible to append a citation URL to the end of any text that a reader selects and uses the "[[copy]]" operation on.

Possible source of script to do this:

* http://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/230-javascript-injecting-extra-info-to-copy-pasted-text/

Criticism. There have been some sites / script that in addition to adding the citation URL also do some sort of tracking of every copy action. This has been written up with some criticism:
* http://daringfireball.net/2010/05/tynt_copy_paste_jerks

Thus if you do choose to implement an approach that adds a citation URL automatically to text that is copied from your [[posts]], be respectful of your readers, and avoid any (especially surreptitious) tracking (e.g. [[utm_]] query params).

=== allow access to fragmention on copying text ===
{{main|fragmentioner}}
Using JS, it is possible to provide access to the [[fragmention]] for a selected text.

== FAQ ==
=== Why a URL UI when address bar has it ===
Q: Why provide a UI to copy/paste the URL of the post (e.g. a text input box pre-filled with the permalink), when the user can just copy/paste the URL from the browser address bar?

A: Browser UIs sometimes do not provide an (easily) accessible the address bar, e.g.:
* mobile browsers (often hide the URL bar, make it hard to get to)
* kiosks, kiosk mode, fullscreen mode, presentation mode

A2: It's also easier for the user, having just finished reading your post, to see the UI immediately in their reading flow, and not having to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking scan] back up to the top of the window for it.
