A '''<dfn>citation</dfn>''' is a reference to something someone said or wrote, typically a published work of some kind, these days often on the web.

Publishing a citation for material discussed in a [[article]], or that a [[reply]] is [[in-reply-to]], are also ways of explicitly and transparently [[giving-credit]] to sources.

== Markup ==
{{main|h-cite}}

When publishing references to published works on the web, use the '''[[h-cite]]''' microformat to markup the '''name''' of the work, '''URL''', '''author''' (with embedded '''[[h-card]] ''name'', ''photo'', and ''URL'' '''), when '''published''', '''publisher''' (if any), when '''retrieved''' (optionally).

== IndieWeb Uses ==
There are several specific indieweb uses of citations.
* [[reply-context]] - a reply-context contains a citation for the original post that the reply is in-reply-to.
* [[comments-display]] - indieweb comments that have been syndicated from their original reply URLs into a "Comments" section on an original post are all ''references'' to original material, and thus are also citations.
* [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer sections]] - external references in footer sections (i.e. in addition to the abovementioned comments display section) are almost always also citations.

== User Interface ==
=== text input ===
A site can provide text inputs with a citation URL (and/or full citation markup) pre-filled in for the reader to copy / paste. IndieWeb Examples:
* {{tantek}} provides text inputs to copy the permalink and citation markup, e.g. bottom of http://tantek.com/2014/120/b1/markup-people-focused-mobile-communication
* [[User:Kartikprabhu.com|Kartik]] provides text inputs to copy permalinks on articles, e.g. bottom of https://kartikprabhu.com/article/indieweb-love-blog
* ...

Silo examples:
* [[Trello#Card_share_UI|Trello' share and more UI]] has a text inputs to copy a [[permashortlink]] of the card, or blockquote markup to embed the card.
* ...

=== append to text selection copy ===
Using [[javascript]] it appears possible to append a citation URL to the end of any text that a reader selects and uses the "[[copy]]" operation on.

Possible source of script to do this:
* http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-a-read-more-link-to-copied-text-in-wordpress/
* http://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/230-javascript-injecting-extra-info-to-copy-pasted-text/

Criticism. There have been some sites / script that in addition to adding the citation URL also do some sort of tracking of every copy action. This has been written up with some criticism:
* http://daringfireball.net/2010/05/tynt_copy_paste_jerks

Thus if you do choose to implement an approach that adds a citation URL automatically to text that is copied from your [[posts]], be respectful of your readers, and avoid any (especially surreptitious) tracking.

=== allow access to fragmention on copying text ===
Using javascript, it is possible to provide access to the fragmention for a selected text.

== FAQ ==
=== Why a URL UI when address bar has it ===
Q: Why provide a UI to copy/paste the URL of the post (e.g. a text input box pre-filled with the permalink), when the user can just copy/paste the URL from the browser address bar?

A: Browser UIs sometimes do not provide an (easily) accessible the address bar, e.g.:
* mobile browsers (often hide the URL bar, make it hard to get to)
* kiosks, kiosk mode, fullscreen mode, presentation mode

A2: It's also easier for the user, having just finished reading your post, to see the UI immediately in their reading flow, and not having to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking scan] back up to the top of the window for it.
