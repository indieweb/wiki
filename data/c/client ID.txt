{{stub}}

'''<dfn>client ID</dfn>''' is how a website or web app identifies itself in [[IndieAuth]] and [[OAuth]].

To avoid the need for pre-registration or dynamic registration of clients in IndieAuth, IndieAuth uses a URL to identify clients. Other projects have adopted this technique for similar reasons:

* [https://github.com/lastlogin-io/obligator Obligator] - an open-source OpenID Connect Provider
* [[Home Assistant]] - an open-source home automation system
