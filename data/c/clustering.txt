{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Clustering</dfn>''' is an approach to displaying similar or related items (such as sequential [[posts]]) as a summary or together in some other reduced form that takes less space, uses fewer words, than if the items were displayed separately.

== Use cases ==
There are numerous uses for clustering, e.g.
* [[composite stream]] - a composite stream can be made more readable and more easily skimmable by clustering adjacent similar items
* [[notifications]] - a series of notifications can be displayed more compactly by clustering notifications about the same item, or from the same person, or both.
* ...

== Specific Methods ==
Clustering methods may differ in different situations and for different types of items.
* [[notification#Clustering|notifications: Clustering]]
* [[like#text_only_design|like text display clustering]]
* [[photo_brainstorming#Clustering|photo posts: Clustering]]
* ...
