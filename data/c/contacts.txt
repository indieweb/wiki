'''<dfn>contacts</dfn>''' refers to a set of [[people]], [[organizations]], [[groups]] and anything else with one or more addresses (often URLs) for [[communication]].

If you‚Äôre looking for contact methods or how to contact someone or a contact page, see:
* '''[[contact]]'''

== Why ==
You may want to keep track of contacts for one or more of the following <span id="Use_Cases">use-cases</span>:
=== Publish Some Followings ===
* "I want to publicly publish a list of people I follow, but there are some people I follow that I do not want public" -aaronpk
=== Notifications Filter ===
* "I want to get push notifications when certain people post, but no notifications for the rest" -aaronpk
=== Reader Filter ===
* "only show me items from NYTimes that 3+ friends have commented on" -tantek
* "thresholds - only show me items from this person that someone else has commented on (or other activity including liking, reposting)" -tantek
=== Mention Lookup ===
* "What is the URL for John Doe so I can mention him" -benthatmustbeme
=== Birthday calendars ===
* ‚ÄúWhen do I send someone a [[birthday]] card?‚Äù -{{martijnvdven}}
** [[Google Calendar]] can use [[Google Contacts]] to automatically generate a birthday calendar.
** [[Facebook]] automatically generates a birthday calendar of your [[friends]], accessible at https://www.facebook.com/events/birthdays if logged in.
=== Lookup anytime ===
* ‚ÄúHow did I get in touch with that person‚Äù -{{martijnvdven}}
** Accessible offline and on the go.
=== Register non-public information ===
* ‚ÄúI have the residential address for someone to be able to visit them, I have to store this myself because they do not publish it elsewhere.‚Äù -{{martijnvdven}}
__TOC__
== How to ==
Contacts may be stored in a local text file, on your server (e.g. like a [[nicknames-cache]]), or accessed via a proprietary silo [[API]] (e.g. [[Gmail]], [[Google Contacts]]), or CardDAV from a silo or some other server.

== Privacy Concerns ==
=== Exporting your Social Graph from the Silo ===

== Software Examples ==
=== InkBlot ===
* There is a UI in [[InkBlot]] since 2016(?) to allow merging any known identities together (as discovered from webmentions).  This allows to have one image for a person no matter which location a reply or like came from. (show the same name / image for a like from twitter and a comment from facebook)
