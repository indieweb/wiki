'''<dfn>contacts</dfn>''' refers to a set of [[people]], [[organizations]], [[groups]] and anything else with one or more addresses (often URLs) for [[communication]].

Contacts may be stored in a local text file, on your server (e.g. like a [[nicknames-cache]]), or accessed via a proprietary silo [[API]] (e.g. [[Gmail]], [[Google Contacts]]), or CardDAV from a silo or some other server.

== Indieweb Examples ==
* {{benthatmustbeme}} has had a UI in [[InkBlot]] since 2016(?) to allow merging any known identities together (as discovered from webmentions).  This allows to have one image for a person no matter which location a reply or like came from. (show the same name / image for a like from twitter and a comment from facebook)
* {{kylewm}} keeps a public view of contacts at https://kylewm.com/contacts
