<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Comments</dfn>''' are displayed in the context of an original post, and may be a mix of syndicated [[reply]] posts from other sites received via [[Webmention]], as well as [[local comments|locally created comments]].</span>

== How to ==
=== How to display ===
Goal: display received comments in high fidelity, at least as nicely designed as the comments that are "natively" displayed on blog posts and [[silo]] posts (e.g. replies on [[Twitter]] posts, comments on [[Facebook]] posts, [[Flickr]]/[[Instagram]] photos, etc. - see [[#Silos|Silos]] below for analysis of their practices).

Per [[comment#Accept_a_comment|Accept a comment]], your system should already be:
* Listening for [[webmention]] on your server (have your server software support it)

And when your server receives a webmention URL:
* parse the '''[[h-entry]]''' at that URL (only use the first h-entry if there's more than one, seriously, it's supposed to be a permalink) - use a [[microformats2]] parser to do so.
* if its hyperlink to the original post has an [[in-reply-to]] url, then continue processing it as a comment. Otherwise, add it to the "Related Articles" or "Mentions" section in the [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]].
* '''get commenter information to display'''
** if the h-entry has a '''p-author''', use its '''h-card''':
** otherwise get the first[[#first-rel-author|*]] '''rel-author''' link on the page, retrieve the URL it points to, and use its representative '''h-card''':
*** '''logo/photo'''
*** '''name'''
*** '''url''' (of commenter profile/homepage)
* '''get the text of the comment to display'''
** IF the h-entry has an '''e-content''', AND if the text is not too long (per your own site UI preference/design, but note that "too long" may be both by character/word count or by number of lines if the content contains newlines), THEN use that, after [[sanitize|sanitizing]] (filtering out unsafe HTML).
** IF there is no '''e-content''' OR it's too long, THEN
*** IF the h-entry has a '''p-summary''', AND the text is not too long, THEN use that (useful author crafted summary or for longer posts where only a part of it is the comment)
**** IF the '''p-summary''' is too long (per your own site UI preference/design), THEN truncate the '''p-summary''' yourself (per below TRUNCATING details)
*** ELSE truncate the '''e-content''' (if any) yourself (per TRUNCATING).
** OTHERWISE (no '''e-content''' and no '''p-summary'''), IF it has a '''p-name''', THEN use that
*** IF the '''p-name''' is too long (per your own site UI preference/design)
*** THEN truncate the '''p-name''' yourself (per TRUNCATING).
** TRUNCATING: IF the text of the comment (however you got it above) is too long (your site, your judgment), THEN abbreviate it with some intelligent ellipsing code (e.g. see [[Twitter#POSSE_abbr_note_to_twitter|POSSEing an abbreviated note to Twitter]] for some thinking) and provide a "See more" / "View more" / "More ..." link to the permalink (useful to have an explicit link to the whole comment right next to the ellipsis when YOU (your site) has chosen to truncate or show only a summary because comments can themselves have an ellipsis at the end).
* '''get more comment info to display'''
** use the h-entry '''dt-published''' for the time of the reply
*** additionally, its '''dt-updated''' could be used for an "edited: datetime" annotation in your display
** use its '''u-url''' for the permalink (hyperlink the time of reply to the permalink)
* '''optional location brainstorm''' - because not many have implemented location info in posted replies
** use the h-entry '''p-geo''' / p-latitude / p-longitude for location - you may need to use a service to translate that into a human readable neighborhood / city / state / country name. perhaps hyperlink to a map, or an aggregation on your site of all posts (and comments) near that location.
*** (Issue: perhaps [[h-entry]] could use a [[p-location]] property similar to [[h-event]] that would permit embedding of an [[h-adr]] with structured address information.)

With that information a sufficiently rich display should be possible in a "Comments" section in the footer on the original post permalink. Add to that for each comment:
* [[webaction]] like/favorite/props button/link
And you've hopefully got a comment display of similar fidelity to anything the [[silos]] have.

Note: some of this has been implemented!
* [[Storytlr]] receives comment posts via [[pingback]], then parses the post content and author information from the [[h-entry]] and [[h-card]] on the page, and then displays:
** author of comment from h-card / name, photo, url properties
** contents of comment post from h-entry / content, published, url properties
** e.g.: http://eschnou.com/entry/testing-indieweb-federation-with-waterpigscouk-aaronpareckicom-and--62-24908.html
* ... what implementation will be next?

Issues:
* '''<span id="first-rel-author">"*first" rel-author</span>''' is good enough because a) there aren't many multiauthor blogs, comparatively speaking, and more importantly b) this is retrieving a *reply* post, and those are always written by a single person, so there should only be a single rel-author on *that* page. Real-world counter-examples welcome.

==== in realtime ====
Even better, if you can display comments in '''[[real-time]]''' on people viewing a post, when they're received by your server, it looks amazing to the user. Idea/challenge [[events/2013-09-30-indieweb-dinner#Realtime_inline_display_of_comments|2013-09-30]].

How to overview:
* keep a websocket open from the browser view of your post with comments to your server
* have your server push comments to your browser view your post through the open websocket.

=== How to markup ===

The post the comments are in reply to should be a top-level h-entry, and comments on it should be marked up as h-cites nested under the comment property. For example:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
 <h1 class="p-name">The Main Entry</h1>
 <p class="p-author h-card">John Smith</p>
 <p class="e-content">A few insights I've had:</p>
 
 <h2>Comments</h2>
 
 <div class="u-comment h-cite">
  <a class="u-author h-card" href="http://jane.example.com/">Jane Bloggs</a>
  <p class="p-content p-name">Ha ha ha great article John.</p>
  <a class="u-url" href="http://jane.example.com/c12">
    <time class="dt-published">2015-07-12 HH:MM</time>
  </a>
 </div>

 <div class="u-comment h-cite">
  <a class="u-author h-card" href="http://kim.example.net">Kim Codes</a>
  <p class="p-content p-name">What were the insights?</p>
  <a class="u-url" href="http://kim.example.net/k23">
    <time class="dt-published">2015-07-12 HH:MM</time>
  </a>
 </div>
 • 
 •
 •
</div>
</nowiki></pre>


What each of these do:
* '''u-comment''' - identifies the element as a comment on the h-entry, for comment discovery when reading an [[h-entry]] for [[salmention]] receiving.
* u-comment '''h-cite''' - identifies the comment as a citation of an actual comment likely copied from somewhere else, for providing a hint for comment discovery to crawl further for an original.
** The [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-prefixes '''u-''' prefix] on the "comment" property works to get the u-url from inside the h-cite
* '''u-author''' - URL to the comment author's site
* u-author '''h-card''' - h-card to structure the author's URL and name into a single structure
* '''p-content''' - complete text content of the comment
* p-content '''p-name''' - use the text of the comment as a label for the comment if necessary in a compact list presentation
* '''u-url''' - permalink of the comment, necessary for [[salmention]] receivers to uniquely identify individual comments
* '''dt-published''' - when the comment was published, provides a text label for linking to the permalink

See also: 
* http://microformats.org/wiki/comment-brainstorming#microformats2_p-comment_h-entry
Which documents a bunch of pre-indieweb thinking of how to markup comments, especially when comments were only made natively on a post directly, rather than being propagated peer-to-peer.

In general this "how to" and the indieweb approach is a further simplification of the microformats comment-brainstorming, with properties added as needed by real world needs.

==== p-content on comment body ====
Note that class="p-content" is used for the body of the comment, here's why:
# '''p-* instead of e-*''': The easiest and safest thing to do is to only show plain text comment content from someone else's site. Therefore use p-content instead of e-content. If you were including links, images, or anything else richer than plain text from someone else's site, then you could use e-content.
# '''p-content instead of p-summary''': Typical comments are small enough to display in their entirety, thus that common case is the entirety of the content not a summary, therefore p-content is more appropriate than p-summary. If for some reason you find it necessary to truncate the comment (or use someone else's "p-summary"), then yes, you should use p-summary instead of p-content.

==== Markup Issues ====

* I think the h-cite markup only works for comments via pingback/webmention, but what about comments made directly on the post using a comment-form? -- [[User:Notizblog.org|pfefferle]]
** Native comments make sense as "h-entry" since the copy of them on the post is likely the canonical copy. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 13:45, 12 July 2015 (PDT)

=== How to delete ===
{{main|deleted#Handling}}
How to delete comments received from other sites.

If an indie web [[reply]]/comment post is [[deleted]], that user's site is expected to send another webmention accordingly.

If when attempting to retrieve the reply permalink URL your server receives a 410 GONE, then your server is expected to delete the existing syndicated copy of that comment.

See [[deleted#Handling|handling deleted posts]] for details.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Automatically:

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} using [[WordPress]], reply comments since 2013-01-15 e.g.

* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4QgMZN/
Uses:
* <code>p-comment h-cite</code> on each embedded comment

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} using [[idno]]  since 2013-07-04 (date of first comment received), e.g.:

* http://voxpelli.com/2013/12/webmentions-for-static-pages/
Uses:
* <code>h-feed</code> of <code>h-entry</code> for each comment

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gregorlove}} using [[Nucleus|Nucleus CMS]] (initially, now [[ProcessWire]]) since 2014-01-08, e.g.
* http://gregorlove.com/2014/01/1178/
* Displaying a consolidated list of local blog comments with webmentions, in chronological order.

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{ martymcguire }} using [https://webmention.io webmention.io] since 2017-03-17 (first comment displayed) to display replies and comments backfed from bridgy. Example:
* https://martymcgui.re/2017/03/04/125651/
Uses:
* <code>u-comment h-cite</code> on each embedded comment

=== Henrik Carlsson ===
[[File:henrik-carlssons-blog.png|200px|thumb|right|Henrik’s feed with inline comments.]]
<a class="h-card external" href="http://henrikcarlsson.se/">Henrik Carlsson</a> displays comments on his site. He does not just show them on the individual post [[permalink]] pages, but also below posts displayed in [[feeds]]. Listen to [http://blog.henrikcarlsson.se/2017/10/microcast-on-inline-comments-and-indieweb-cmses/ his argument on this].

=== Basil ===
The post provides quick insight as to like and share counts but focus on verbal feedback - making for a more cleaner interface. By keeping the more expressive aspect of one's replies (comments versus a like or reply) as the content of the post, it makes the region less busy.

[[File:Screenshot_20200518_145505.png|200px|thumb|right|Showing the response content on Basil's post about Microsub.]]

* https://web.archive.org/web/20200518184116/https://trivial.observer/blog/micropub/

=== Manually Display ===
E.g. List of links in a [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]] section:

==== Tom Morris ====
{{tommorris}} sometimes adds links+favicons to a “this post is discussed further at” section ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160316210842/https://tommorris.org/posts/2506 Archived example]).

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} sometimes maintains a citation list of posts which link to one of his posts, e.g. 
* http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web#silos-vs-open-social-web-comments
And more recently is experimenting with manually incorporating indieweb [[reply]] posts into a comments section:
* http://tantek.com/2015/190/b1/blinking-fever#blinking-fever-comments
Uses:
* <code>u-comment h-cite</code> on each embedded comment

==== Kartik Prabhu ====
{{kartik}} sometimes manually adds comments/replies to his comments on other sites that don't support webmention:
* https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/re-metric-clifford-signs2#response-replies

=== Past Practices ===
* [[User:tantek.com|Tantek]] used to maintain lists of links to his posts of people’s names linked to comment permalinks:
** 2002: [http://tantek.com/log/2002/12.html#L20021216t2238 inline list with flags to represent comment languages]
** 2003: [http://tantek.com/log/2003/12.html#L20031215t0830 inline list with some text annotations].
** 2005: [http://tantek.com/log/2005/10.html#d02t1813 block list with follow-ups to comments]

=== Past Examples ===
==== Laurent Eschenauer ====
[[User:Eschnou.com|Laurent Eschenauer]] using [[Storytlr]]: displayed comment posts from the IndieWeb marked up with [[h-entry]] and received via [[pingback]], and comments posted locally on his posts, in an integrated time-ordered "Comments" section, since 2013-04-19 (til ~2016). e.g.:

* https://web.archive.org/web/20141207162739/https://eschnou.com/entry/testing-indieweb-federation-with-waterpigscouk-aaronpareckicom-and--62-24908.html <!-- originaly URL, seems to have gone down in 2016: http://eschnou.com/entry/testing-indieweb-federation-with-waterpigscouk-aaronpareckicom-and--62-24908.html -->

==== Sandeep Shetty ====
[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]] using [[Projects#Converspace|Converspace]] since 2013-06-22 (date of first comment; was up til ~2016)
* https://web.archive.org/web/20160310211032/http://www.sandeep.io/64 <!-- original URL, 404 since 2016: http://www.sandeep.io/64 -->

== Policy Examples ==
Some sites have a policy around what kind of comments are permitted on their site and what to expect before, during and after a comment's posted.

* {{fluffy}} has one at http://beesbuzz.biz/comment-policy
* https://kevq.uk/commenting-guidelines

=== Other examples ===
* [https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?wp_super_faq=why-did-you-delete-my-comment Peter Woit], physicist at Columbia University: 
** <blockquote>[https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?page_id=4338 Why did you delete my comment?]: I delete a lot of the comments submitted here. For some postings, the majority of submitted comments get deleted. I don't delete comments because the commenter disagrees with me, actually comments agreeing with me are deleted far more often than ones that disagree with me. The overall goal is to try and maintain a comment section worth reading, so comments should ideally be well-informed and tell us something true that we didn't already know. The most common reason for deleting a comment is that it's off-topic. Often people are inspired by something in a posting to start discussing something else that interests them and that they feel is likely to interest others here. Unfortunately I have neither the time nor inclination to take on the thankless job of running a general discussion forum here.</blockquote>
* https://web.archive.org/web/20200119183724/https://slatestarcodex.com/comments/

=== Why ===
It can be useful to set expectations for others about what one will allow or not on one's own site.

Ideally people are posting their comments and replies on their own sites and sending [[webmentions]], so even if their content is moderated or removed from the site to which they're replying, they still own a copy of the original content.

== Silos ==
In general existing blog/silo posts display comments (in either chronological or reverse chronological order) with the following details:
* '''commenter logo/photo'''
* '''commenter name'''
** '''hyperlinked to commenter profile'''
* '''full text''' of comment
* '''time''' of comment
** often in relative time since rather than absolute datetime
*** though see reasons why [http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/08/23/1/you-should-not-be-displaying-relative-dates you should not be displaying relative dates]
** '''hyperlinked to comment permalink'''
* '''commenter location''' (variable granularity) at time of comment writing
** '''hyperlinked''' to silo aggregation of activity at that location
* '''like/favorite button''' (to like or favorite the comment/@-reply)

=== Tumblr ===
[[Tumblr]] groups various different response types into a generic “notes” feed, at the bottom of each post ([http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/47159818629/something-something-syncing#notes example]). They show:
* The author’s username
* The author’s profile photo

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] shows all tweets which are both in-reply-to a particular tweet AND contain the original tweeters @name below the tweet metadata in chronological order. They provide a “reply” box above (?) the reply feed ([https://twitter.com/wilto/status/322028394944532480 example]). The tweets have:
* The authors name
* The author’s @name
* The author’s profile photo
* A relative timestamp
* The tweet content
* A bunch of actions (on hover)

Twitter replies are ordered according to an undocumented "relevance" heuristic https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-conversations#ranking

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] treats comments as completely secondary to “full” posts, showing them in chronological order beneath the post’s action bar. Facebook only show the latest ~4 comments if there are more, and display the leave-a-comment box below. They have:
* The author’s name
* The author’s profile photo
* The comment content
* A relative timestamp
* 'via mobile' if applicable
* Like button w/ like counter
[[File:facebook-post-with-responses.png]]

== Native Comments ==
There is no consensus on the use or avoidance of "native" comments on personal sites. There is some evidence that such comments are often filled with spam and require extra [[admin tax]]. However, there's also the reduced effort it takes for other people to participate on a blog without having a domain or having to log in.

Other Examples:
* GitHub Blog asks for feedback on posts via Twitter, e.g.:
** https://blog.github.com/2018-10-30-oct21-post-incident-analysis/#conclusion
** <blockquote>Have feedback on this post? Let @github know on Twitter.</blockquote>
** No evidence they actually literally use "Twitter for comments" because no comments from Twitter are shown on the post.

== Comments Embeds ==
Some [[silos]] have a comments embed which is used by various sites to host comments elsewhere:
* [https://comments.network/ comments.network] - show comments from hacker news or reddit on your page
* [[Disqus]] - their focus is to provide comments or ("discussion" - hence their name) sections on other pages.
* [[Facebook]] - see [[Facebook#Comments_Embed|Comments Embed]]
* [https://www.hypercomments.com/ HyperComments]
* Github issues can be used to host comments:
** [http://donw.io/post/github-comments/ github-comments] - Use a [[GitHub]] issue for post comments, load them via javascript. See [[GitHub#Using_Github_for_comments]]
** [https://github.com/imsun/gitment gitment]
** [https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk/ gitalk]
** [https://utteranc.es/ utteranc.es]

Open source commenting embed:
* [https://commento.adtac.pw commento] - go-based
** also available as a paid service: https://commento.io/
* [https://github.com/phusion/juvia Juvia] - a commenting system you can install on your own server similar to Disqus and [[Intense Debate]]
* [https://github.com/skx/e-comments/ e-comments] -  External comments for static HTML pages, a lightweight self-hosted disqus alternative.
* [http://coralproject.net/products/talk.html Mozilla Talk] - System for comment moderation and display (Javascript)
* [https://github.com/gka/schnack schnack] - nodejs-based commenting embed with oauth support
* [https://cactus.chat/ cactus.chat] - [[Python]] application with an embed for commenting using [[Matrix]]

== Comment Hiding ==
[https://stevenf.com/shutupcss/ shutup.css] is custom stylesheet that hides comments on many popular websites. As such it is empirical research on how silos mark up comments. See [http://stevenf.com/shutup/shutup-latest.css the CSS] for details.

== Difference between comments and mentions ==

If the original post does not have an explicit [[in-reply-to]] property indicating that it's a direct reply to your post, then you should not present it in the same style or group as you present comments. This can mislead viewers to think that a generic mention is a comment on the post, which can change the interpretation of the original post out of context. For example, see the exchange below for an illustration of how presenting a mention as a comment can change the meaning.

== FAQ ==
=== Why use p-summary when I can truncate e-content ===
''Q: I guess if I grab the e-content and think it's too long, I might as well just truncate it myself. why would I need the p-summary?''

A: Because the p-summary is likely (or even just possibly) explicitly crafted by the author/publishers to be a more meaningfully truncated version of the e-content than you could yourself automatically truncate.

=== Why use u-comment instead of p-comment ===
'''Q:''' Why use <code>u-comment</code> around the comment instead of <code>p-comment</code>?

'''A:''' <code>u-comment</code> will parse the comment's implied value as the comment's URL, which is useful for [[salmention]] support. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-07-22#t1437612361069]

== Discussion ==
* Long posts where only a part of it is in-reply-to another post and a large chuck of it is a tangent should not be published as a reply/comment and instead should be published as a mention. Noting this here because this is accounted for above in the "How to display > get the text of the comment to display" section and it might wrongly send the message that (largely tangential) posts like these should be marked up with in-reply-to. (See [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-07-07/line/1373241638])
* https://the-pastry-box-project.net/marie-connelly/2014-june-24
* For places where comments can't be included in line the use of a <code>u-responses</code> to point to another page containing a list of <code>h-entry</code> objects with all of the received comments would be useful. Useful in blog lists and when using an external WebMention endpoint such as [http://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com] [[User:Kodfabrik.se|Kodfabrik.se]]

=== How to mark up nested comments? ===

Nested comments could easily be caused by [[Salmention]]. [[reply-chain]] has some examples of people showing multiple replies.

The only one currently nesting comments seems to be {{benthatmustbeme}}. He adds `u-comment h-cite` elements within `u-comment h-cite`. An example taken from https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2014/4/24/1/_:

<pre>
<div class="comment u-comment h-cite">
    <div class='comment_header'>
        <span class="minicard h-card u-author">
            <img class='comment_author u-photo' src="https://ben.thatmustbe.me/image/static/icon_128.jpg" />
            <span class="p-name u-url" href="https://ben.thatmustbe.me" rel="nofollow" title="Ben Roberts" >
                Ben Roberts
            </span>

== Brainstorming ==
=== Scaling Presentation ===
How do you scale the display of hundreds (or more) of comments or responses in general?

E.g. see:
* {{aaronpk}}'s 100+ item facepile of likes: https://aaronparecki.com/2017/03/02/9/midi-poop-emoji

=== Collapsing ===
Similar to how many use [[facepile]]s to collapse the display of [[likes]] and [[reposts]], there may be opportunities to collapse displays of comments.

Related:
* [[like#markup_for_hypertext_design|collapsing series of adjacent like posts from the same person]]
* [[likes]] e.g. as a [[facepile]] or shorter summary of a few people and a count e.g.:
** https://gregorlove.com/2017/10/hello-san-diego/#responses

Use-cases:
==== Collapsing comment threads ====
* '''Thread of comments''' (see also [[salmentions]]) that you may want to manually/automatically collapse to show only the first in a thread and perhaps a count of number in that thread)

E.g. Some prior art here from forum software which tends to show a list of threads, then you have to click into a thread to see the comments on that thread.

==== Collapsing similar comments ====
* '''Same or similar comments'''. Some posts may elicit very similar or identical comments from many people, which could be collapsed by showing the comment once, with multiple authors that said the same thing represented perhaps by a facepile or series of icons (instead of the usual single comment author icon)

Examples:
* Numerous "nice" @-replies on https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1168915870959226882
* FB clustering of "happy birthday/bday" type comments on someone's birthday and summarizing with "N people wished this person a happy birthday" (feels like it could be bad emotional design though, inciting comparison of number of well wishers on special events)

Minimum viable way to match these comments:
* trim whitespace and punctuation and then case insensitive string equal
** perhaps don't trim a "?" as it sufficiently alters the meaning of the reply, e.g. "nice!" vs. "nice?"

== Previous specifications for display ==
(this historical section could be moved to its own page)

Included here for thoroughness / historical purposes - a critique of <span id="Existing_specifications_for_display">existing specifications for display</span>.

Summary: Existing specifications either don't say much or provide bad advice for what to display (if anything) in response to receiving a webmention.

=== Trackback display ===
{{main|Trackback}}
The [http://movabletype.org/documentation/trackback/specification.html TrackBack Specification] (and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback Trackback Wikipedia page]) doesn't appear to have any explicit implementation guidance for how to display trackback pings that have been received.

In practice however, many CMS's display trackbacks in a section explicitly labeled "Trackbacks:", and for each such trackback ping:
* title of the post that sent the trackback
* ellipsed [...] ... [...] summary text, which is nearly unreadable without more context, and doesn't even show what phrase linked to the original blog post if any.
* the overall visual design is very dated and has fallen behind modern comment presentation designs

=== Pingback display ===
{{main|pingback#Poor_display}}

See [[pingback#Poor_display|Pingback: Poor display]] for detail on how the specification itself provides very poor advice on display.

Pingback display practices appear to have been mostly based on Trackback display practices. Unfortunately, in practice Pingback displays are nearly always useless, e.g.
* https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/04/10/gearing-up-for-the-next-chapter/

Problems demonstrated:
* "Pingback from" is jargon - provides no value to the user - only noise
* the title of the comment blog post is useless as it provides a summary of the original blog post
* the [...] ... [...] summary text is nearly unreadable without more context, and doesn't even show what phrase linked to the original blog post
** in the first pingback, even just including the entire first paragraph of the comment post would have been better. And if it wasn't a reply then it should just be a list of related articles (date, author, linked post name, all marked up with [[h-cite]]), rather than including cryptic broken summaries.

Myself it would burden me to appear on the blog of I do not know who without permission.</blockquote>
** "Mais bon, ce qui m’a dissuadée d’utiliser les Webmentions, c’est le fait de publier sur mon blog le tweet, le nom et l’avatar de personnes qui ne m’ont pas explicitement autorisé à le faire… Moi-même ça me lourderait d’apparaître sur le blog de je sais pas qui sans permission." [https://marieguillaumet.com @kReEsTaL] July 8, 2019
* Consider potential abuse before displaying comments without any filtering / moderation UX, e.g. https://twitter.com/fvsch/status/1148159831087419392
** "I see a few people on the Indie Web movement adding Webmentions to their blogs and I'm wondering: it looks like they're all men? What happens _when_ (not if) you have thousands of webmentions that are 95% abuse and threats from white/male supremacists?" [https://fvsch.com @fvsch] July 8, 2019

* Brainstorming, especially the framing of "mean time to comment": https://twitter.com/bmann/status/1355646110375628800
** "That would be @benwerd, of course :P<br><br>Bringing @withknown back in the form of social comments / community around blogs would be pretty awesome. I talked about #MicroPub and #IndieWeb and the concept of mean-time-to-comment as part of the puzzle of getting feedback on a site." [https://bmannconsulting.com @bmann] January 30, 2021
* Example: using GitHub issues for comments on their posts: this issue seems to be setup to literally be the comment thread for a particular post: [https://github.com/karlcow/otsukare.info/issues/2 #2 Browser Wish List - Bookmark This Selection] — which if the issue was marked up as a syndication of the post, Bridgy could backfeed the issue comments to the post!

* Why it’s ok (and good!) to limit who can comment on your posts (commenters can make their own posts!) 8m16s video: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CUkhxAOrNbG/
* Brainstorm: How to display replies in a [[reader]]: When a reader sees [[reply]] posts in the collection of feeds being followed, it can display those (as comments) when it displays the original posts in the collection of feeds being followed. The point (deliberate design) is to display replies from feeds you already follow, in the context of the original post, rather than displaying "all replies".
