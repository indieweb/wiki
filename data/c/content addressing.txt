'''<dfn>content addressing</dfn>''' is a way of looking up pages or files by hashes of their contents rather than the URL of their origin server.

== Use in existing web standards ==

[https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#script-src-hash-usage CSP allows specification of hashes] eg 

  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
                         script-src 'self' https://example.com 'sha256-base64 encoded hash'

[https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/#cryptographic-hash-functions Sub-resource Integrity] does too
  Conformant user agents must support the SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 
  cryptographic hash functions for use as part of a request’s integrity 
  metadata and may support additional hash functions.
  User agents should refuse to support known-weak hashing functions
  like MD5 or SHA-1 and should restrict supported hashing functions 
  to those known to be collision-resistant.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request service worker requests] have

  Request.integrity Read only
    Contains the subresource integrity value of the request 
    (e.g., sha256- BpfBw7ivV8q2jLiT13fxDYAe2tJllusRSZ273h2nFSE=).

== Proposed new standards ==

Some discussion at IETF - see [https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/95/slides/slides-95-httpbis-1.pdf this presentation] and drafts:

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-http-scd
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-http-bc
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-reschke-http-oob-encoding
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-http-mice
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding

Note the use of this header:
   x-object-meta-sha1base36: 1d91dx0894wjewukeyxu56os5uhx4ph

== Strange de facto standards ==
[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/2001NovDec/0090.html HTTP Extensions for a Content-Addressable Web (2001)] no longer on the web except as a mailing list archive

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme Magnet URIs] - wikipedia article is more current than the [http://magnet-uri.sourceforge.net/ site] or [http://magnet-uri.sourceforge.net/magnet-draft-overview.txt draft]

== Possible integrations ==
If servers use a prefixed hash in the above format as an ETag, that could enable incremental usage of content hashes.
