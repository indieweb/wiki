{{stub}}
'''<dfn>content warning</dfn>''' is a feature of a post [[create]] UI where an author can hide by default some or all of the primary content of a post due to some concern about the nature of the content.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(this section is a stub)
=== fluffy ===
{{beesbuzz.biz}} publishes some posts with content warnings, which means they are treated differently when displayed on index pages (including RSS/atom feeds), vs. in the full entry context.

Some examples:

* Atom feed: Normally entries get full-content; however, if there's a CW/cut for whatever reason, that is hidden behind a "read more"
* Comics: CWs will collapse the entry preamble into a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>, e.g. http://beesbuzz.biz/comics/guest/?id=161 or http://beesbuzz.biz/comics/guest/161-Pushy-Garnet-Vitreous-Lava-Tickling#isso-thread
** [[Publ CMS|Publ]] also has the capability of providing different crops on an index vs. full page, although the beesbuzz.biz site templates currently (as of 9/23/2019) do not make use of that.
* Blog entries: CW for the "read more" link as well as on the full entry page, e.g. https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/1371-There-are-no-happy-endings; also used for spoilers, e.g. https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/4193-She-Ra-Season-5-opening-titles
** Templates also override Publ's auto-summary function for page unfurls and mf2 cards

== Software Support ==
=== Mastodon ===
In [[Mastodon]] a "Show More" button allows a viewer to explicitly decide they want to reveal and see the content that has been hidden by default by the author.

In [[ActivityPub]], this post is represented with a summary property of "Indieweb-style OAuth" and the content property is the full text of the post.

== Brainstorming ==

=== Preventing Spoilers ===
One potential use case for a Content Warning would be to prevent spoilers. If I want to post about a new episode of Game of Thrones, it would be useful to put a CW on it with a reference to a reason (Game of Thrones Spoilers). This would allow a reader to minimize the post with a reason it is minimized "Game of Thrones Spoilers". This allows someone to tap on it and reveal the hidden message inside.
* Potential cons: 
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534786052677200 Usability]: Having to click to view a ton of posts in your timeline
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534786144517700 Not using it]: 99 Posts might be properly covered by CW but then 1 person might not, still spoiling it.
* Alternatives:
** [[mute]]
** [[muffle]]
* IRC conversations on this:

=== Ideas ===
* Is there a way to categorize CW posts so that if you unhide one of a specific category in a reader you could unhide the rest of the same category?
* Post content of a CW would be the normal post. It would just need some way to indicate that it was a post with sensitive content and potentially a way to either provide a reason or a category. This could be as simple as adding something like a <code>p-warning-reason</code> or something to that extent.

We found substantial evidence that trigger warnings counter therapeutically, reinforce survivors‚Äô view of their trauma as central to their identity.</blockquote>
