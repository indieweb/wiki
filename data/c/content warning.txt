'''<dfn>content warning</dfn>''' is a feature of a post [[create]] UI where an author can hide by default some or all of the primary content of a post due to some concern about the nature of the content.

== Software Support ==
=== Mastodon ===
In [[Mastodon]] a "Show More" button allows a viewer to explicitly decide they want to reveal and see the content that has been hidden by default by the author.

In [[ActivityPub]], this post is represented with a summary property of "Indieweb-style OAuth" and the content property is the full text of the post.
