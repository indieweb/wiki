{{stub}}
'''<dfn>content warning</dfn>''' is a feature of a post [[create]] UI where an author can hide by default some or all of the primary content of a post due to some concern about the nature of the content.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(this section is a stub)
=== Fluffy ===
{{fluffy}} publishes some posts with content warnings, which means they are treated differently when displayed in stream, and when published in feed files (RSS).
* ... link to example post(s)
* ... detail(s) of design / implementation

== Software Support ==
=== Mastodon ===
In [[Mastodon]] a "Show More" button allows a viewer to explicitly decide they want to reveal and see the content that has been hidden by default by the author.

In [[ActivityPub]], this post is represented with a summary property of "Indieweb-style OAuth" and the content property is the full text of the post.

== Brainstorming ==

=== Preventing Spoilers ===
One potential use case for a Content Warning would be to prevent spoilers. If I want to post about a new episode of Game of Thrones, it would be useful to put a CW on it with a reference to a reason (Game of Thrones Spoilers). This would allow a reader to minimize the post with a reason it is minimized "Game of Thrones Spoilers". This allows someone to tap on it and reveal the hidden message inside.
* Potential cons: 
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534786052677200 Usability]: Having to click to view a ton of posts in your timeline
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534786144517700 Not using it]: 99 Posts might be properly covered by CW but then 1 person might not, still spoiling it.
* Alternatives:
** [[mute]]
** [[muffle]]
* IRC conversations on this:

=== Ideas ===
* Is there a way to categorize CW posts so that if you unhide one of a specific category in a reader you could unhide the rest of the same category?
* Post content of a CW would be the normal post. It would just need some way to indicate that it was a post with sensitive content and potentially a way to either provide a reason or a category. This could be as simple as adding something like a <code>p-warning-reason</code> or something to that extent.
