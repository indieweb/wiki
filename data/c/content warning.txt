'''<dfn>content warning</dfn>''' is a feature of a post [[create]] UI where an author can hide by default some or all of the primary content of a post due to some concern about the nature of the content.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(this section is a stub)
=== fluffy ===
{{beesbuzz.biz}} publishes some posts with content warnings, which means they are treated differently when displayed on index pages (including RSS/atom feeds), vs. in the full entry context.

Some examples:

* Atom feed: Normally entries get full-content; however, if there's a CW/cut for whatever reason, that is hidden behind a "read more"
* Comics: CWs will collapse the entry preamble into a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>, e.g. http://beesbuzz.biz/comics/guest/?id=161 or http://beesbuzz.biz/comics/guest/161-Pushy-Garnet-Vitreous-Lava-Tickling#isso-thread
** [[Publ CMS|Publ]] also has the capability of providing different crops on an index vs. full page, although the beesbuzz.biz site templates currently (as of 9/23/2019) do not make use of that.
* Blog entries: CW for the "read more" link as well as on the full entry page, e.g. https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/1371-There-are-no-happy-endings; also used for spoilers, e.g. https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/4193-She-Ra-Season-5-opening-titles
** Templates also override Publ's auto-summary function for page unfurls and mf2 cards

{{sgreger}} displays a warning when presenting bookmarked websites that have accessibility flaws with potential for seizures ([https://sebastiangreger.net/2022/01/link-in-bio-platforms-new-geocities permalink]):

== Other Examples ==
=== Trove ===
[https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/198419351 Trove] is an Australian-based website that has pop up content warnings that provide cultural advice for indigenous peoples who may have issues with images and audio of deceased persons.

[[File:content_warning_modal_for_cultural_advice.PNG|center|alt=Screen capture of a pop up warning that reads Cultural Adivce - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that Trove contains images, voices or names of deceased persons in photographs, websites, film, audio recordings or printed material with buttons to Find out More or Don't show cultural advice.]]

== Software Support ==
=== Mastodon ===
In [[Mastodon]] a "Show More" button allows a viewer to explicitly decide they want to reveal and see the content that has been hidden by default by the author.

In [[ActivityPub]], this post is represented with a summary property of "Indieweb-style OAuth" and the content property is the full text of the post.

== Brainstorming ==

=== Preventing Spoilers ===
One potential use case for a Content Warning would be to prevent spoilers. If I want to post about a new episode of Game of Thrones, it would be useful to put a CW on it with a reference to a reason (Game of Thrones Spoilers). This would allow a reader to minimize the post with a reason it is minimized "Game of Thrones Spoilers". This allows someone to tap on it and reveal the hidden message inside.
* Potential cons: 
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534786052677200 Usability]: Having to click to view a ton of posts in your timeline
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534786144517700 Not using it]: 99 Posts might be properly covered by CW but then 1 person might not, still spoiling it.
* Alternatives:
** [[mute]]
** [[muffle]]
* IRC conversations on this:
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534785365024300 start of convo] to [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-08-20#t1534786623088600 end of convo]

=== Ideas ===
* Is there a way to categorize CW posts so that if you unhide one of a specific category in a reader you could unhide the rest of the same category?
* Post content of a CW would be the normal post. It would just need some way to indicate that it was a post with sensitive content and potentially a way to either provide a reason or a category. This could be as simple as adding something like a <code>p-warning-reason</code> or something to that extent.

=== UX issues ===

When providing a CW, it's important to remember that there are different navigation paths one might take to a page. It might be tempting to have the CW itself on one's feed and then unfurl the content on the entry page, but keep in mind that someone might navigate to an entry via a different path, such as a previous/next link from another entry, or an external search result from a search engine.

For many small updates in succession, there should always be an option to "unfurl all."

CWs should also <em>not</em> be used habitually to hide absolutely everything; on Mastodon there is a tendency for people to over-CW things and as a result many users have reported getting into the habit of unfurling everything without thinking about it, and then being shocked/upset by seeing a thing they weren't expecting.

* Study criticizing “trigger warnings”: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702620921341 <blockquote>We found no evidence that trigger warnings were helpful for trauma survivors, for participants who self-reported a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, or for participants who qualified for probable PTSD, even when survivors’ trauma matched the passages’ content. We found substantial evidence that trigger warnings counter therapeutically, reinforce survivors’ view of their trauma as central to their identity.</blockquote>
