'''<dfn>create</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb refers to the act of and [[UI]] for creating a new [[post]], in its simplest form, a new [[note]].

Specific types of create UIs:
* [[create event]]
* ...

Related: ''[[creator]]'', someone who is creating [[UI]], [[design]], [[code]] for their own site.

__TOC__
=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] hosts a public [[Taproot]] creation interface:
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/new
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/articles/new

For screenshots see:
* [[Taproot#Notes|Taproot Notes interface]]

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} is the creator of [[Quill]].

To bookmark a page (create a [[bookmark]] post on his own site), Aaron uses:

* a '''bookmarklet''' to activate quill.p3k.io/bookmark with the URL to bookmark pre-filled in
* '''[[quill]]''' uses [[micropub]] to 
* '''create a [[bookmark]]''' post on his site.

(screenshot needed)

Previously, Aaron's software included a creation interface. Old screenshots can be seen at [[p3k-v1]].

=== Tom Morris ===
{{main|Ferocity#Posting_UI}}
[[User:tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] uses [[Ferocity]] on tommorris.org with the following note creation interface since  2013-03-25 (or perhaps earlier)

* The circle-in-circle is for geolocation: clicking it on uses the browser geolocation API to set the location of the post.
* The tickbox for Twitter lets him decide whether to syndicate the post to Twitter or not.

=== Jeremy Keith ===
==== adactio notes ====
Since 2014-05-27, [[User:adactio.com|Jeremy Keith]]'s note creation UI ("simple update form") on his home page when he's logged into his site adactio.com:

[http://adactio.com/journal/6826/ https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/13/screenshots/1577366/adactio-form.png][https://dribbble.com/shots/1577366-Speak-your-brains]

==== and adactio photos ====
On 2014-07-05 he added the ability to attach a photo to a note, as a way to do simple [[photo]] posts (which [[POSSE]]d to both [[Twitter]] and [[Flickr]]

You can barely see the UI with the addition of a "Choose File" HTML file input, in the second window on his laptop screen here in this photograph:

==== per silo POSSE toggles ====
He then subsequently ~2014-10-01 added the ability to selectively (per post) toggle POSSEing to Twitter and/or Flickr (both default on).

Jeremy has also '''[https://gist.github.com/adactio open sourced]''' these animated sliding toggles:

=== Calm Technology ===
calmtechnology.com is a topic focused indieweb site by {{caseorganic}} that runs [[WordPress]] and [[P2]].

[https://www.flickr.com/photos/caseorganic/16357718359/ https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8619/16357718359_133a897e38.jpg]

Note the simple one big text box with big "Post it" button as the focus of the UI, with minor optional elements to add media and tags, all inline above the most recent posts for context.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} posts notes using this interface. For more information, see his ongoing [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes|notes documentation]].

== Mobile ==
Mobile note creation is particularly challenging for various reasons:
* less reliable network (thus possible loss of user data if depending on JS / AJAX)
* smaller displays (less space to see what you're typing)
* touch keyboards (clumsier / less accurate than physical tactile keyboard)

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]], at the top of your profile/wall "timeline" presents a UI for creating a new post with three explicit post-type options:
* Status | Photo/Video | Life Event
With "Status" chosen by default, and the prompting text: "What's on your mind?"

[[File:Facebook profile create post 2015-09-20.png]]

This is a big simplification from their past create UIs that had various post types explicitly differentiated in the UI like [[checkin]], link/[[bookmark]], etc.

==== FB activate create ====
If you activate the text area (where the default text is), new options are provided below it:

[[File:Facebook profile create post options 2015-09-20.png]]

The icons represent (and show as tooltip text if you hover)
* "Add photos to your post"
* "Tag people in your post"
* "Add what you're doing or how you're feeling"
* "Add a location to your post" (auto-filled with a city name, and showing a close box to remove)
* "Set date and time of your post"
* Who should see this? Public, Friends, Only Me (default), Custom, school, company1, company2, ... companyN

==== FB Text size adjustment while typing ====
The text area has a variable text size that depends on how long the status update you are creating is.

==== FB Life Event ====
Selecting "Life Event" expands the create box into a set of categories to choose from:
* Work & Education, Family & Relationships, Home & Living, Health & Wellness, Travel & Experience
[[File:Facebook profile create life event 2015-09-20.png]]

==== FB reselect status ====
If you now reselect "Status" - it activates the text field, and shows the same status options as noted above.

[[File:Facebook-create-for-pages.png]]

==== FB create bgcolor ====
When creating from the home page instead of your profile (n.b. I found this true from profile also - {{t}}), the interface is slightly different. It also includes an option to select background color. After clicking "Background Color" you have several color options to choose: 

[[File:Facebook-background-color-2017-04-07.png]]

After choosing a color, the background changes in the window:

==== FB create new feature ====
Sometimes Facebook adds a new feature to their create UI, and notifies you with a little blue mini-overlay:

[[File:2017-06-30-facebook-create-ui-new-feature.png]]

==== Facebook Events ====
{{main|create_event#Facebook|create event:Facebook}}
Noticeably absent from the above [[create]] UI is anything to do with creating [[event]]s (the kind you invite people to).

Event creation UI is only present contextually, when viewing your events or your calendar.

* facebook.com/username/events -> <blockquote style="text-align:right"><samp>[ + Create Event ] [ ‚úèÔ∏è ]</samp></blockquote>  buttons (the pencil button is for "Manage" - not sure what that means
* https://facebook.com/events -> <blockquote><samp>[ + Create ]</samp></blockquote> button in the left column

Clicking "+Create [Event]" presents a dialog to enter event details:

[[File:Facebook-create-event-ui.png]]

After the initial event has been created, the [[edit]] event UI does include an option to select an existing photo. Read more on [[edit#Facebook_Events]].

Event public/private options:
* Private Event with "Guests can invite friends" (default)
* Private Event - only hosts can invite friends
* Public Event - anyone can view it, even without being logged in

For more details, including issues, <span id="Duplicate_Event">duplicate event</span> which itself can cause cryptic errors like "<span id="FB_Something_went_wrong">Something went wrong</span>", "<span id="FB_Warning_Slow_Down">Warning Slow Down</span>", and having <span id="FB_Went_Wrong_But_Created_Event">events created despite error</span> messages, see:
* [[create_event#Facebook|create event:Facebook]]

=== Google Calendar ===
{{main|create_event#Google_Calendar|create event: Google Calendar}}
[[Google Calendar]] has the ability to create an event from brief plain text like expressions like "Dinner tomorrow night" ‚Äî need a citation / documentation of actual plain text expressions supported by Google Calendar.

=== [[Amazon Reviews]] ===
[[Amazon Reviews]] provides a UI to create reviews about products. It begins by prompting you to choose a star rating, and then progressively adds fields as you complete each step.

[[File:amazon-review-start.png]]

=== LinkedIn ===
[[LinkedIn]] has a publishing interface for posting articles. It supports adding the following elements:

* upload a cover image
* headline
* post body, prompting with "Write here. Add images or a video for visual impact."

The content section allows simple formatting options:
* header level: 1, 2, 3
* bold, italic, underline
* numbered and bullet lists
* blockquotes 
* hyperlinks

== Brainstorming ==
=== Photo ===
Some of the above [[#IndieWeb_Examples]] have photo post creation UIs inline, typically as extensions to note creation UIs.

This section is for brainstorming about photo-centric creation UIs.

Brainstorming of UIs to create photo posts.

See: [[photo upload]] for the process/challenges of uploading a photo to your server.

==== UI flow ====
A possible UI flow for a low-perceived-latency photo post creation experience:

# user chooses photo to post. web app immediately starts uploading it to the server in the bg.
# user filters / crops the photo. web app captures the sequence of filter/crop instructions, and when the user is "done" editing, web app sends that instruction sequence to the server.
# server applies the filter/crop on its end
# user adds [[person-tags]], text content (caption) etc.
# user taps "post" or whatever, and only that text is left to send, everything else is already at the server, and the post appears *immediately*

You could maintain the sequence of filter/crop instructions purely as CSS filter and crop (width, height, object-fit:cover, object-position) properties and values, using them to display the image clientside, and serve that CSS from the server to make people's browsers do that filtering/cropping for you so you don't have to actually use ImageMagick or other server-side image manipulation software.

=== HTML Box ===
* Actual amount of metadata required for correct microformats markup is minimal but often the number of file systems required by many OSS CMS solutions complicate the workflow.
* Having a writing UI that just accepted plain HTML and required the user to include microformats2 maybe a an attractive use case.
* Would need to know how much templating to include, top level h*?
* Would want to be able to parse urls for some post types likes, bookmarks,  etc


==== Applying Filters ====
Here are some libraries/resources to apply filters to images:
* http://coremob.github.io/camera/vanilla/index.html
* http://www.girliemac.com/blog/2014/03/02/filterous/
* https://una.im/CSSgram/

The CSS Filter feature allows you to do all sorts of image manipulation effects on images:
