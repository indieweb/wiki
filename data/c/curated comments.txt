{{stub}}

'''<dfn>curated comments</dfn>''' are an approach to presenting [[comments]] on [[posts]] which emphasize one or more techniques for only showing comments that have been explicitly selected by the original post author, both from other sites and [[local comments]], sometimes with a [[UI]] deliberately designed to solicit comments as collaborative notes to be added to the original post.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{t}} started adding curated comments (reply permalink link and author) to his blog posts from 2002-2007, and more recently has added manual "Comments" post footer sections, with an explicit notice about the curation and sources of comments, to a few articles with selected comments from other sources. Examples:
** 2024-07-08 https://tantek.com/2024/180/b1/responsible-inventing#responsible-inventing-comments
** 2007-01-04 [https://tantek.com/log/2007/01.html#d04t0130 New Years Resolutions 2007]
** 2002-10-22 [https://tantek.com/log/2002/10.html#L20021022t1432 Bed and BReakfast markup (B&BR)], scroll to the "Comments:" at the end with commenter names linked to their comment permalinks, with a flag in front of their name when their comment is in a different language.
* {{claudinec}} is manually curating comments from the fediverse: https://www.claudinec.net/posts/2024-05-26-indieweb/
