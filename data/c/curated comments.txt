{{stub}}

'''<dfn>curated comments</dfn>''' are an approach to presenting [[comments]] on [[posts]] which emphasize one or more techniques for only showing comments that have been explicitly selected by the original post author, both from other sites and [[local comments]], sometimes with a [[UI]] deliberately designed to solicit comments as collaborative notes to be added to the original post.
