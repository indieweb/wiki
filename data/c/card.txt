A '''<dfn>card</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb are small information summaries—often summaries of specific, external web pages.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
For the moment, current indieweb work is focusing on developing a simpler alternative to all the silo-specific card approaches. See:
* '''[[indiecard]]'''

== Silo Examples ==
=== Apple Passbook ===
[[Apple]]
* (Apple Passbook API/format reference needed)

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] uses [[OGP]] and other markup on a page to parse data to shows summaries of pages linked to in Facebook posts in a "card" like presentation.

Examples of Facebook "cards" displays:
* [[link-preview]] for the first URL in a post
* [[hovercard]] shown when hovering the mouse pointer over someone's name, including face, name, friendship status, etc.
* ...

=== Google now ===
{{main|Google now}}

Google now uses cards as a method of display of various information - see the [[Google now]] page for more overall, and http://www.google.com/landing/now/#cards for examples. Some of Google now's cards appear to be produced from [[recommendation engine]]s.

=== Twitter Cards ===
{{main|Twitter Cards}}
[[Twitter]] uses [[OGP]] and their own proprietary meta tags to provide [[Twitter Cards]] functionality in tweets.

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] has a concept called “profilecard”. This is a special page for every profile that does not show any of the photos and only a representation of the profile itself with its bio line and external links.

Example:
* [https://www.instagram.com/visit_varberg/profilecard/ @visit_varberg] ([https://archive.ph/AB0OS archived])

== Proxies ==
=== Embedly ===
Embedly has a card embedding service at http://embed.ly/cards that parses other sites, and generates a card that you can embed, using a variant of [[oEmbed]].
