'''<dfn>cc</dfn>''' is the pattern of [[mention]]ing someone in a public post to bring it to their attention, for example "/cc @username" at the end of a tweet. Evolved from the CC (carbon-copy) field in e-mails, and actual copies in physical mail.


== Silo Example ==
=== pnut ===
[[pnut]] allows one to cc other users on posts by means of a /@username construct.

The email notification settings on [[pnut]] allow one to choose whether or not to be notified about ccs.
