A '''<dfn>Commonplace book</dfn>''' (or commonplaces) are a way to compile and store knowledge, usually by writing information into books, notebooks, card catalogs, or in more modern settings on one's own website.


== Brief History ==
The general concept of the commonplace book dates to the 1500's (though earlier precursors exist) as books became more common in society. Often due to the exorbitant cost of texts, readers would read and take notes from them into their commonplace books for future contemplation, providing direct [[quotation|quotations]] at a later date, or future reference prior to returning the book to its owner or passing it along to another. In some sense they became repositories for [[marginalia]], [[highlights]] and notes one wanted to keep after the possession of a book was released. Commonplaces are frequently used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts they have learned. Each commonplace book is unique to its creator's particular interests.
__TOC__

A variety of means and methods for compiling and organizing commonplaces have been devised over their hundreds of years of use. An early how-to book entitled ''A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books'' (1706) was written by philosopher John Locke in which he provided techniques for entering proverbs, [[quotation|quotations]], ideas, and formulating speeches. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and [[tags|category]], using such key topics as love, politics, or religion.


== The Indieweb site as a Commonplace book ==
Given the prevalence and variety of [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|post types]] on indieweb sites, their form and function often makes them de facto modern day commonplace books. Traditional commonplace books can often be found to have [[note|notes]], the equivalent of [[bookmark|bookmarks]], [[repost|reposts]], [[article|articles]], [[photo|sketches or diagrams]], [[review|reviews]], [[recipe|recipes]], [[read|lists of things read]], and [[quotation|quotations]] which have direct correlates of indieweb [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|post types]].

The ability to [[tag]], hyperlink, and [[search]] indieweb sites adds to their general usability in a way that traditional handwritten commonplace books lacked. Rarely, if ever, were commonplace books written in chronological order like journals or in reverse chronological order like blogs. More sophisticated search and [[archive|archive pages]] (temporal or by category, tag, or topic) preclude this structural need now. 

Commonplace books can be contrasted with other early written forms like diaries, journals, scrapbooks, and travelogues. Some of these functions are served by traditional blogs and personal websites while other post types along the lines of a "life log" or features of quantified self sites round out some of what may also make an indieweb site.


== Examples ==
=== Indieweb examples ===
* {{kevinmarks}} In many conversations with Kevin, one will begin to notice a pattern. He will often not only have previously thought about the topic at hand, but at one time or another he'll have written a blog post about it detailing those thoughts. He'll then do a quick search of his [[multi-site_indieweb|site(s)]] and proffer the link which not only contains an/''the''(?) "answer", but likely a lot of other additional thought and material above and beyond that one is likely to be interested in as well.
* {{chrisaldrich}} I speficially state on my [http://boffosocko.com/#Brief+Philosophy homepage] "I use this website as my primary hub for online presence and communication and to some extent as my online commonplace book." The primary categories on my site give a bit of an index overview of some of the material I "collect" and in which I'm interested. I often post [http://boffosocko.com/2017/03/28/indieweb-quote-of-the-day-vladimir-bukovsky-on-samizdat/ quotes], quick recipes, bookmarks of things I want to read in certain categories, and [http://boffosocko.com/2012/06/17/big-history/#Highlights%2C+Quotes%2C+%26+Marginalia notes/highlights/marginalia] from books I've read.
* {{mrkrndvs}} uses a [https://collect.readwriterespond.com/ secondary website entitled Read Write Collect] to collect ideas, articles and thoughts which supports his primary website.
* [https://indieweb.org/User:Wiobyrne.com Ian O'Byrne] has a [https://breadcrumbs.wiobyrne.com/start-here/ "Breadcrumbs" website] on which he states: "This website is my digital commonplace book."
* {{jgmac1106}} Captures all his annotations, bookmarks, and links to read articles from his blog. He also captures all class activity as a teacher.

=== Examples in the Wild ===
* [https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/about-this-blog/ Nelson Minar] "A few folks have subscribed to this blog recently. Welcome! I am not writing for you. I am truly, only, writing work notes for myself. Stuff I learn and donâ€™t want to forget."
* [http://rasmusen.dreamhosters.com/b/about/ Eric Rasmusen]:
<blockquote><p>This weblog is mainly for myself, used as a commonplace book in which I put ideas, quotations, facts, and citations that I might want to use later. Thatâ€™s why the topics are diverse and often esoteric. Iâ€™m not trying to build an audence or get a lot of hits on a counter. My impression is that most visitors arrive because search engines have led them to here and Iâ€™m one of the few websites in the world that address some key word theyâ€™re interested in.</p>

<p>Since I am not writing for other people, especially (you will see the exceptionsâ€”things such as posts I also use as comments on other blogs, excerpts from letters or articles I have written or will write, and so forth), please do not think I am deliberately trying to offend someone or that I am cleverly pushing a hidden agenda. Iâ€™m not, simply because I donâ€™t expect enough people to read this blog for such efforts to be worthwhile. Actually, I probably shouldnâ€™t even fix my typos, and perhaps Iâ€™ll stop doing that. Youâ€™re weclome to read, and Iâ€™ll try to write well simply to avoid getting into bad habits, but Iâ€™ll not expend more effort than if I were writing this into a hidden fil in my PC.</p></blockquote>
