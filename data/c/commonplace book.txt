A '''<dfn>commonplace book</dfn>''' (or <dfn>commonplaces</dfn>) are a way to compile and store knowledge, usually by writing information into books, notebooks, card catalogs, or in more modern settings on one's own website.

Variations on this structural theme and the broader functional purposes and UI for aggregation/[[collections|collecting]], memory, learning, [[spaced repetition]] and similar patterns of knowledge related work include '''florilegium''' (books of flowers), '''anthologies''', notebooks, miscellanies, pocket books, memoranda books, diaries, thesauruses ("treasure chests"), albums, scrapbooks, ''sylva rerum'' ("forests of things"), table books, ''vade mecum'' ("go with me"), '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book waste books]'''/'''[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudelb%C3%BCcher sudelbücher]''', '''second brains''', and '''digital gardens'''. This page can serve as an aggregation point for some of these related ideas until or unless it becomes worthwhile to separate these to delineate some of the different specific features they may have.

__TOC__
== Brief History ==
The general concept of the commonplace book dates to the 1500's (though earlier precursors exist) as books became more common in society. Often due to the exorbitant cost of texts, readers would read and take notes from them into their commonplace books for future contemplation, providing direct [[quotation|quotations]] at a later date, or future reference prior to returning the book to its owner or passing it along to another. In some sense they became repositories for [[marginalia]], [[highlights]] and notes one wanted to keep after the possession of a book was released. Commonplaces are frequently used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts they have learned. Each commonplace book is unique to its creator's particular interests.


A variety of means and methods for compiling and organizing commonplaces have been devised over their hundreds of years of use. An early how-to book entitled ''A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books'' (1706) was written by philosopher John Locke in which he provided techniques for entering proverbs, [[quotation|quotations]], ideas, and formulating speeches. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and [[tags|category]], using such key topics as love, politics, or religion.


== The IndieWeb site as a Commonplace book ==
Given the prevalence and variety of [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|post types]] on indieweb sites, their form and function often makes them de facto modern day commonplace books. Traditional commonplace books can often be found to have [[note|notes]], the equivalent of [[bookmark|bookmarks]], [[repost|reposts]], [[article|articles]], [[photo|sketches or diagrams]], [[review|reviews]], [[recipe|recipes]], [[read|lists of things read]], and [[quotation|quotations]] which have direct correlates of indieweb [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|post types]].

The ability to [[tag]], hyperlink, and [[search]] indieweb sites adds to their general usability in a way that traditional handwritten commonplace books lacked. Rarely, if ever, were commonplace books written in chronological order like journals or in reverse chronological order like blogs. More sophisticated search and [[archive|archive pages]] (temporal or by category, tag, or topic) preclude this structural need now. 

Commonplace books can be contrasted with other early written forms like diaries, journals, scrapbooks, and travelogues. Some of these functions are served by traditional blogs and personal websites while other post types along the lines of a "life log" or features of quantified self sites round out some of what may also make an indieweb site.

He'll then do a quick search of his [[multi-site_indieweb|site(s)]] and proffer the link which not only contains an/''the''(?) "answer", but likely a lot of other additional thought and material above and beyond that one is likely to be interested in as well.

That’s why the topics are diverse and often esoteric. I’m not trying to build an audence or get a lot of hits on a counter. My impression is that most visitors arrive because search engines have led them to here and I’m one of the few websites in the world that address some key word they’re interested in.</p>

<p>Since I am not writing for other people, especially (you will see the exceptions—things such as posts I also use as comments on other blogs, excerpts from letters or articles I have written or will write, and so forth), please do not think I am deliberately trying to offend someone or that I am cleverly pushing a hidden agenda. I’m not, simply because I don’t expect enough people to read this blog for such efforts to be worthwhile. Actually, I probably shouldn’t even fix my typos, and perhaps I’ll stop doing that. You’re weclome to read, and I’ll try to write well simply to avoid getting into bad habits, but I’ll not expend more effort than if I were writing this into a hidden fil in my PC.</p></blockquote>

The user has full ownership and control of their data. At no time does Obsidian own or control the user's personal data.
** [https://obsidian.md/publish Obsidian Publish] provides hosting with the option to use one's [[personal domain]] to publish one's notes to the web. This would allow one to use it as the basis for an IndieWeb site.

** <blockquote>"In its most customary form, “commonplacing,” as it was called, involved transcribing interesting or inspirational passages from one’s reading, assembling a personalized encyclopedia of quotations. It was a kind of solitary version of the original web logs: an archive of interesting tidbits that one encountered during one’s textual browsing."</blockquote>

== Quotes ==
* 2020-06-10 [https://thestudy.substack.com/p/the-study-issue-32-keeping-a-commonplace The Study: Issue #32 — Keeping a Commonplace Book] <blockquote>Commonplace Book is NOT: … a journal, … your collection of morning pages., … a stream of consciousness rambling of your thoughts.</blockquote>…<blockquote>NOT using these apps as your permanent commonplace book repositories though. Apps die and technologies change, but… <br/><br/><br/>…paper is forever</blockquote>

* tl;dr for an online commonplace book (maybe needs curation / deliberation details)

* “For example, I've been blogging for four years, which means I've poured out about a million words' worth of my thoughts online.

* “Writing a blog entry about a useful and/or interesting subject forces me to extract the salient features of the link into a two- or three-sentence elevator pitch to my readers, whose decision to follow a link is predicated on my ability to convey its interestingness to them.

== History of this page ==
=== Split page question ===
Should this page be split, e.g. separating '''[[digital garden]]''' into its own page?
* +1 {{t}}: reason: those using "digital garden" mean something in particular (see https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/ ) and seem to have no attachment or affinity with "commonplace book" (which is also quite an academic-sounding phrase/term). Even if they are conceptually similar, there is a very different attitude about them, and frankly even their metaphors are quite contrasting: '''dead tree vs. living plants''' — <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://tantek.com/logo.jpg}} [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]]</span> 14:11, 3 April 2021 (PDT)
* +1 {{amar}}: reason: echo that I've never heard the term "commonplace book" before, but "digital garden" is quite pervasive, and I would consider it distinct. I also find the metaphor to imply different things (e.g. a place others can visit and maybe even participate in tending to, plants that you tend to over time, rather than the more unchanging or chronological nature of something scrapbook-like or journal-like, etc) — [[User:Yousefamar.com|Yousefamar.com]] ([[User talk:Yousefamar.com|talk]]) 12:24, 5 April 2023 (PDT)
* ...

2023-04-07 {{t}} stubbed [[digital garden]] for these reasons and started moving specific content there.

* Journalist John Dickerson [https://twitter.com/jdickerson/status/1458036871531937798 indicates] that he uses [[Instagram]] as a commonplace: https://www.instagram.com/jfdlibrary/ where he keeps a collection of photo "cards" with quotes from famous people rather than photos. He also keeps collections there of photos of notes from scraps of paper as well as photos of [[annotation]]s he makes in books.

* A great example of an online commonplace book prominently featuring quotes with an index featuring authors, titles, categories, and even translators. Even more interesting, it looks like it's hand built using a large table. https://www.hjkeen.net/halqn/index.htm
