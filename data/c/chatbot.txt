A '''<dfn>chatbot</dfn>''' is a piece of software that interacts with a user via a chat/DM protocol rather than having its own app or protocol. They have existed for a long time in the form of IRC bots and so on, but in 2015/16 became a trend in the tech industry after designers and developers learned of the popularity of chatbots elsewhere, e.g. on Chinese services like [[WeChat]].

Chatbots and interfaces designed around chatbot-style interaction are often called '''conversational UIs'''.

== Advantages ==

* In group chats, a bot can provide information in-place to all participants (vs someone switching to a different app to do something and pasting the result)
* Chatbots don't require you to design a specific GUI.
* People have proposed chatbots as an alternative to downloading an app for a particular company. If you already have a chat application installed (like Facebook Messenger or Telegram etc.) then interacting with a chatbot doesn't require you to download a large application which can then run potentially malicious code on your phone.
* Interaction can be quite a bit faster and more fluid than interacting with an app.
* Historical log of interactions is stored and sometimes shared between devices.

== Disadvantages ==

* Undocumented interface. This means they have similar limitations to some command line applications.
* Stateful interaction makes it hard to compare options that have been presented. If one were shopping for a product, a chatbot interface doesn't allow you to open up multiple products in different tabs and compare them.
* Lack of URIs. Web sites have URLs for particular interactions. You can't bookmark a message from a chatbot and send it to a friend. There is no canonical home for a piece of content sent thorugh a chatbot stream.

== Chat networks that enable bot integration ==

* [[IRC]] 
* [[Matrix]]
* [[Telegram]] - [https://core.telegram.org/bots/ documentation]
* [[Slack]] (for business/group use)
* Facebook Messenger

== IndieWeb uses ==

* The indieweb [[discuss|chat channels]] use bots, [[Loqi]] and [[Kaja]], for a variety of tasks.
* The [[PostrChild]] is a [[micropub]] client as a chatbot that lets you post to your site from different instant messaging apps such as [[Slack]] and [[Telegram]].
* {{sknebel}} uses an IRC bot to receive notifications from his website

* {{sebsel}} was using a bot named 'bop' on the [[Raspberry Pi]] that ran his IRC bouncer (and a private IRC network for it), to get notifications of Webmentions, logins and Micropub actions.

== Possible IndieWeb uses ==

* Notifying post authors of webmentions, comments and other interactions with their posts
* Checking in: Telegram allows you to send a location. On iOS, it brings up a list of nearby venues which can be transmitted to a server.
* Personal reminders, notification of scheduled posts
