'''<dfn>curl -H</dfn>''' is a command line option for the [[curl]] command that takes a single parameter of an extra header to include in the request. E.g.:
* <kbd>curl -H "Accept: application/json"</kbd>

Equivalent in PHP for setting curl options in a <var>$c</var> variable:
* <code>curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Accept: application/json'));</code>
