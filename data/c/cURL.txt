'''<dfn>cURL</dfn>''' is a common *nix software library and command line tool, used to get/send requests to a URL using only [[HTTP]](S).

cURL can be used to send raw data, including files and RFC form-data as an alternative to browser or other client, which may be used to implement a more formal solution in your language of choice.

== Language bindings ==

* PHP integrates with libcurl to provide a familiar interface as part of the [php_curl / ext-curl extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/curl.installation.php)

== Non-*nix platforms ==

For windows cygwin or similar environments such as the WSL, vagrant, docker or VM may give access to cURL.

For other operating systems including mac OSx, BSD and Linux, these are considered *nix and installing may be only an install away if not pre-installed.
