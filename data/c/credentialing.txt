'''<dfn>credentialing</dfn>''' is the issuance of a verified claim by an issuer about a subject. These claims can be achievements, such as a university degree or open badges, or information about the subject such as name or address. The Open Badges Specification is a vocabulary and set of protocols that describes credentials.
