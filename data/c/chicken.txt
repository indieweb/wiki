== Why ==
<blockquote>This is the classic cold start problem of social.  The answer to the traditional chicken-and-egg question is actually answerable: what comes first is a single chicken, and then another chicken, and then another chicken, and so on. The harder version of the question is why the first chicken came and stayed when no other chickens were around, and why the others followed.</blockquote>&mdash;[https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service Eugene Wei]
