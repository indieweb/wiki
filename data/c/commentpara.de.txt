'''<dfn>[https://commentpara.de/ commentpara.de]</dfn>''' is an open source system for anonymous sign-in and commenting, using building blocks [[IndieAuth]], [[Micropub]], and [[Webmention]]. It allows login with a free-to-type name and avatar image, and comments under this identity.

2023-11-27: There appears to be an issue when commenting, the Micropub request responds with an error. An issue has been filed: https://github.com/cweiske/anoweco/issues/11

It supports
* [[IndieAuthProtocol]] to log into IndieAuth-enabled sites and tools anonymously. Simply provide <tt>https://commentpara.de/</tt> as "your domain" when signing into tools like [[Quill]].
* [[Micropub]] to post comments to posts.
* Sends [[Webmention]]s to the URL that was replied to

Written and hosted by {{cweiske}}.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
People using commentpara.de on their website to allow comments from anyone:

* [[User:Scripter.co|Kaushal Modi]] has a "Write a comment" button under the blog posts that uses Quill + commentpara.de
* [[User:www.maxwelljoslyn.com|Maxwell Joslyn]] added an option to "leave a public comment" under his posts on 2020-03-21. This uses Quill + commentpara.de (I got the idea from Kicks Condor)
* {{jamietanna}} uses this under all his posts
* {{aciccarello}} had a link under [https://www.ciccarello.me/posts/2022/09/09/displaying-webmentions/ posts on ciccarello.me] to allow replying via commentpara.de. Removed in November 2023.
