** "A thing about Mastodon that I didn't realize I'd missed from pre-algorithm Twitter is the sheer randomness of the content. No longer honed to be hyper-engaging (usually by being scary or enraging) I now see weird experiments, fun scientific papers, random shitposts. Of course it's not all exactly in my wheelhouse, but that makes it simultaneously more *interesting* while being less *addictive*. The whole experience feels a lot healthier for my brain."
