** "Or the problem could be that the decentralization hasn't been taken far enough. Why should comments be tied to a particular website at all? Comments can be federated in exactly the same way people are talking about opening up Twitter and turning it into a "distributed service" or even a "protocol". Even without true federation, you can still extract comments from the major aggregators via their APIs. So the notion of where a comment ultimately "lives" starts to get blurry."
