A <dfn>'''/canon page'''</dfn> is (AKA a 'personal canon') a [[page]] on your website that lists the things that have influenced you the most, like a list of books, articles, websites, media, and ideas.

==Why Create A Canon Page?==
* Provides a glimpse into your interests
* Creates a place for others to make discoveries
* Serves as a archive of meaningful influences

== Why not to ==
* "canon" doesn't mean "interests" — we have a page for that: [[interests]]
* "canon" doesn't mean "influences" either. See [[#misnamed]] for details.

==How To Create A Canon Page==

===Gather Your Influences===

Start by reviewing existing lists you may have:
* Books you've read
* Favorite article, music, films, and other media
* Websites you regularly visit
* Ideas and concepts that changed your thinking

===Create Your List===

List everything that comes to mind as a potential influence. Narrow your selection to the most significant ones. 

Optionally, group them into categories. Like:

* By type: books, articles, websites, media, ideas
* By topic: your areas of interest or expertise
* By theme: concepts that connect ones
* Chronologically: when these entered your life

== Criticism ==
=== misnamed ===
{{t}}: "interests" or "influenced by" is not what "canon" means. See any of the meanings in the dictionary or [[Wikipedia:Canon]] disambiguation page.

This looks like it may have been mistakenly created as an attempt at a "trend".

If you want to create a page of your "interests" (per first point in "Why"), there's already a page for that:
* [[interests]]

If you want create a page of your influences (per third point in "Why"), then just called it that: 
* <code>/influences</code>

Using a word to meaning something than what it means is a form of deliberate obfuscation and unless that's your goal, it's a bad idea.
