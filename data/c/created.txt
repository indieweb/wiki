'''<dfn>created</dfn>''' is the datetime a [[post]] was started by an author, which may be different from the date the post was [[published]], such as when a post is authored offline and sent or saved to a website later.

Note that this created datetime is from the authorâ€™s perspective, the datetime when the author takes an action to start a new post, not when some web server or other backend specific data structure or other [[plumbing]] is created.
