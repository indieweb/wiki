'''<dfn>chipotle</dfn>''' is a [[page]] displaying the site owner's [https://www.chipotle.com/values Chipotle&reg;] order.

The first mention of the <code>chipotle</code> page was in [https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks/112399982743407003 this May 7, 2024 Mastodon post] by Shellsharks.

== Why ==
This page was created by blogger [https://shellsharks.com Shellsharks] as a parody of other single-purpose pages such as [[now]], [[ideas]], and [[nope]].

You should make a "chipotle" page so when a friend is picking up Chipotle for you, you can send them a link instead of having to redescribe/retype your Chipotle order.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

** "In response to recent #weblogpomo2024 and #indieweb / #blogging posts introducing the /interests and /nope pages, I want to debut my own top-level /PAGE - /chipotle!https://shellsharks.com/chipotleYep! If anyone wants to know my usual Chipotle order then look no further, this has got ya covered. I encourage others to join the movement and share your own order at <YourDomain>/chipotle! ðŸ˜„" [https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks @shellsharks] May 7, 2024

Historical example of when you should send someone to get you Chipotle (using your /chipotle order prefs page) instead of going yourself: 2015-10-04 Vice: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnjwb4/the-myspace-worm-that-changed-the-internet-forever The MySpace Worm that Changed the Internet Forever] <blockquote>â€¦ Kamkar went for a burrito at Chipotle and then went home to check his MySpace profile again. At that point he had almost a million friend requests.</blockquote>
