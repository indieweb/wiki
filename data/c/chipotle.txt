'''chipotle''' is a [[page]] displaying the site owner's [https://www.chipotle.com/values Chipotle&reg;] order.

The first mention of the <code>chipotle</code> page was in [https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks/112399982743407003 this May 7, 2024 Mastodon post] by Shellsharks.

== Why ==
This page was created by blogger [https://shellsharks.com Shellsharks] as a parody of other single-purpose pages such as [[now]], [[ideas]], and [[nope]].

You should make a "chipotle" page so when a friend is picking up Chipotle for you, you can send them a link instead of having to redescribe/retype your Chipotle order.

When you should send someone to get you Chipotle (using your /chipotle order prefs page) instead of going yourself: 2015-10-04 Vice: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnjwb4/the-myspace-worm-that-changed-the-internet-forever The MySpace Worm that Changed the Internet Forever] <blockquote>â€¦ Kamkar went for a burrito at Chipotle and then went home to check his MySpace profile again. At that point he had almost a million friend requests.</blockquote>
