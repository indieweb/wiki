'''<dfn>clock</dfn>''' is something that shows the time, like a watch, except either larger or affixed somewhere or both; in the context of the indieweb, a clock on your home page shows the time where you are, and a clock on your wall at home shows where you are, like https://aaronparecki.com/2016/01/04/9/harry-potter-clock.
