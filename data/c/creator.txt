{{emojicon|📐🔨}}
A '''<dfn>creator</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb is someone who owns their domain, uses it as their primary identity on the web, creates (for example, code, design, user experience) for their site, and openly shares at least some of those creations.

== IndieWeb ==
{{main|indieweb}}
The IndieWeb is about owning your domain and using it as your primary identity.
* You can have more than one such personal domain.
* You could use your own domain for purely a ''professional'' identity facet, preferring to keep anything personal off the internet/web. That's totally fine.
__TOC__
== Creator ==
Being a <span id="builder">creator</span> means you must do one or more of:
* '''Code'''. Create or contribute to IndieWeb open source projects
* '''Design'''. Create or contribute to IndieWeb designs, graphic, layout, adaptive or otherwise.
* '''User experience'''. Create wireframes or other IndieWeb user interface flows

As an ''IndieWeb'' creator, you develop an instinct of making things to scratch [[itches]], rather than (or at least in addition to), talking about them.

== Participate ==
As an ''IndieWeb'' creator, you must be using the things you create (code, design, user experience) on your personal site as an active participant of the IndieWeb. If it's not good enough for you, as part of your online identity, then it's not good enough for the IndieWeb.

== Sharing ==
Lastly, one of the goals of IndieWebCamp is to empower each other and interoperability among our sites, encouraging re-use of code, design, user experience and thus:

You must share at least some part of what you create.

You don't have to share the entirety of what you create or even most of it.

Just find some part of it that it at least minimally useful, and that you're OK with sharing.

It's OK to start small, even just a function or two, or some graphics files, or user experience flow diagrams, or even just wiki design descriptions, for example, URL designs, and slowly add to it over time.

The point is to take ''something'' that is powering or has empowered ''your'' IndieWeb site, that you work on, develop, improve, create, and share it with others, in the hopes that it will help empower and improve their IndieWeb sites.

== IndieWebCamps ==
As a creator, you're encouraged to sign-up to and participate in IndieWebCamps, to meet other creators, collaborate on improving each others sites, and growing the IndieWeb.

See upcoming IndieWebCamp [[events]].

You are encouraged to bring an [[apprentice]] to IndieWebCamp, to help them get their [[own domain]] and [[Getting_Started|setup]] their identity and content on their own site.
