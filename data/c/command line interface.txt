{{stub}}

'''<dfn>command line interface</dfn>''' is the primary interaction in a terminal application, and refers to the use of text-based commands to take actions such as install or update software, and is a requirement for setting up most [[CMS]]s and often running [[SSG]]s, and due to the difficult to remember and easy to get wrong text commands, something that is for developers only, and not to be recommended for any general purpose IndieWeb tools or software.
