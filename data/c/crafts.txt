'''<dfn>Crafts</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>crafting</dfn>''' is a range of common [[hobby|hobbies]] about which some IndieWeb sites focus some of their content. In addition to photos of finished projects, sites often include descriptions, tips, descriptions, research, and patterns by which others might recreate those projects. Crafts include activities like knitting, crocheting, cross stitch, [[3D printing]], wood working, restoration, etc.

== Silos ==
=== Ravelry ===
[[Ravelry]] is a [[silo]] that has social and e-commerce functionality for building a community and around knitting.

== Brainstorming ==
Communities around crafts often have fora (forums) on a variety of silos, but this sort of functionality might be replicated using [[tags]], [[Webmention]], or [[discovery]]-based platforms similar to [[Indieweb.xyz]] or [[IndieNews]]. 

One can also post their content on their personal website and [[syndicate]] copies to existing craft-related social services.

IndieWeb [[friendly]] services like [[Micro.blog]] have [[discovery]] features like [[tagmoji]] for topics like knitting: https://micro.blog/discover/knitting
