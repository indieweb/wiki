{{stub}}

'''<dfn>consent screen</dfn>''' is the page you see during an OAuth flow that asks whether you want to allow the application you're logging in to to be able to access the data it's requesting.

The idea is to provide the user with enough information to make an informed decision about what they are providing to the application, and give them the opportunity to amend / reject the request.

== Examples ==

=== Dmitri Shuralyov ===

This is an example of a simple consent screen implemented in {{ds}}'s IndieAuth server. It displays an attempt to sign in to the https://unicyclic.com website as https://dmitri.shuralyov.com.

Although {{jamietanna}} is still building the initial version of his IndieAuth server, the initial design shows the user a choice of scopes, with information about what they allow:
