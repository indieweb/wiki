'''<dfn>consent screen</dfn>''' is the page you see during an OAuth flow that asks whether you want to allow the application you're logging in to to be able to access the data it's requesting.

== Examples ==

This is an example of a simple consent screen implemented in {{ds}}'s IndieAuth server. It displays an attempt to sign in to the https://unicyclic.com website as https://dmitri.shuralyov.com.
