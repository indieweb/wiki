A '''<dfn>private account</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] account where all posts on its profile are private, and only approved followers (or friends) can see posts.

Typical private account support:
* is purely binary, that is either all your posts are public or all of them are private.
* following a private account creates a request for approval, which then must be explicitly approved 
* switching from a public account to a private account keeps existing followers (and friends)

== Silo Examples ==
=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] has a private account feature in its "OPTIONS" screen accessible from your profile (lower right button in their native apps).

Details:
* public to private change:
** existing likes by non-followers appear to persist (though it's not clear how those non-followers could view those photos)

* private status is not visible to followers

# See where it says "Tweet privacy"
# Check "[âœ“] Protect my Tweets" where it says just below it: <blockquote>If selected, only those you approve will receive your Tweets. Your future Tweets will not be available publicly. Tweets posted previously may still be publicly visible in some places. [https://support.twitter.com/articles/14016 Learn more].</blockquote> (needs screenshot)
# Scroll down to the bottom and click [Save Changes]

Native retweets are disabled on private account tweets.

== Facebook ==
[[Facebook]] does not have a single "private account" on/off switch, but rather finer grained privacy controls per post, posts by default, etc. For more details, and how to set posts to private by default, old public posts to private, see:
