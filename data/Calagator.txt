'''<dfn>[http://calagator.org/ Calagator]</dfn>''' is an [[event]] hosting [[silo]] and [[aggregator]] that supports importing events marked up with [[hCalendar]].

== POSSE to Calagator ==
It is possible to manually [[POSSE]] to Calagator. If you're doing so, maintain as many of your structured fields as possible.

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}} manually POSSEs his indie [[event]]s to Calagator since at least [https://aaronparecki.com/events/2014/12/03/1/homebrew-website-club 2014-12-03]. E.g.
* Original indie event: https://aaronparecki.com/events/2014/12/03/1/homebrew-website-club
** POSSE Calagator copy: http://calagator.org/events/1250467428

== Feature Requests ==
=== Create from h-event ===
* https://github.com/calagator/calagator/issues/240

Ideally one should be able to automatically POSSE to Calagator, which, if issue 240 is implemented/resolved, then you should be able to do so with:
* <nowiki>a curl GET of http://calagator.org/sources/new?url='+escape(indieEventPermalink)</nowiki>

=== Webmention RSVP support ===
It would be great to be able to:
* post an indie [[RSVP]] post in-reply-to a Calagator event permalink (doable today per your own site)
* send a webmention to Calagator
** requires Calagator event permalinks have discoverable [[webmention]] endpoints
* have Calagator process that [[RSVP]] response
** requires Calagator's webmention endpoint to fetch/verify/ and check for [[RSVP]] markup
** requires Calagator to handle webmention updates (e.g. for people changing their RSVP)
** nice to have: Calagtor to handle webmention [[delete]] (e.g. for people that just want to delete any reference to an event at all)
* have Calagator display that RSVP
** requires Calagator's event RSVP designs to add show indie RSVPs in "Attending" (or Maybe or Not), along with when RSVP was posted/received, hyperlinked to permalink of RSVP
