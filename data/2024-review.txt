'''<dfn>2024-review</dfn>''' is a list of indieweb and indiewebcamp accomplishments for all of 2024, as well as indieweb-related news in 2024.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Blog what you got done on your personal indieweb site (or anything IndieWebCamp related) in 2024, and add a link here! Roughly in date order (earliest first) by first year in review post made (i.e. if an author made more than one). See [[2023-review#IndieWeb_Examples|last year’s year in review posts]] for examples!

== IndieWebCampers ==
[[2014-review#This_Is_A_Movement|2014's grid of everyone]] who went to an IndieWebCamp looked great - let's make another one for 2024.

Grid of all the people who attended *any* 2024 IndieWebCamp from the Guest_List pages, with their names and domain names underneath their photos - everything linked to their domain. 

'''IN PROGRESS'''. Please add yourself if you participated in an IndieWebCamp in 2024, and feel free to add all others from any IndieWebCamp 2024 Guest List as well!

Please also help with ordering alphabetically by fullname - helps to avoid duplicates!
