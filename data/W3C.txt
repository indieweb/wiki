The '''<dfn>World Wide Web Consortium</dfn> (W3C)''' is an international standards organization for the world wide web.

== Social Web Working Group  ==
In 2014, W3C launched the Social Web Working Group, co-chaired by  IndieWebCamp participants {{tantek}} and Evan Prodromou, and IBM representative Arnaud Le Hors. The working group has a wiki at https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg and participation is encouraged.

== Issues ==
''Please help expand this section''

Difficulty has been reported in the application process to be an "invited expert" in the Social Web Working Group. The link to the application prompts for a login, which is confusing. You must first create a W3C account at https://www.w3.org/accounts/request, then open the application once you are logged in.

== Resources ==
W3C hosts various resources at permalinks, e.g. http://www.w3.org/Icons/
* http://www.w3.org/Icons/house.gif - icon of a [[home]]
* http://www.w3.org/Icons/text.gif - icon of a text [[note]]
* http://www.w3.org/Icons/envelope.gif - icon of an envelope for a [[message]]
