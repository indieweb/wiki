'''<dfn>Slack</dfn>''' is a closed-source team communication tool similar to [[IRC]] but with expanding support for various types of content such as emoji polls, inline images, and attachments.

== IndieWebCamp Slack ==
We are experimenting with an IndieWebCamp Slack room. It is connected to our [[IRC]] room so there is still a single conversation thread. 

You can join the Slack room by creating an account starting here:

== FAQ ==
=== What is Slackbot ===
<dfn id="Slackbot">Slackbot</dfn> is the bot that appears in Slack.

== Experience ==
People love Slack HQ. They make it clear to see who’s speaking with avatars and whitespace, offset the speaker from the text, make it clear what the person said, and de-emphasize the timestamp and room actions. They also support emoji. Caveat: I’ve never used it, I just know they’re doing something right because people are fanatical about it. — [[User:Chloeweil.com]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE to ===
It may be possible to POSSE [[posts]] to slack, e.g. even [[photo]] posts.

No known IndieWeb Examples of people POSSEing to Slack.
