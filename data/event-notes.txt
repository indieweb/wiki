Notes on how to run a successful IndieWebCamp.

== Schedule Outline ==

=== Day 0 - Friday ===
* Optional pre-party Friday evening

=== Day 1 - Saturday ===
* 15-30 minutes - for registration and free-form meet & greet. Organizers set up the unconference board.
* 15 minutes - Intro to IndieWebCamp, brief overview of the schedule for the event, thanks to sponsors (led by event host)
* 60-90 minutes - [[selfdogfood]] demos. These are demos by participants of what they have running on their own personal website. Product pitches/demos are not acceptable, unless the presenter's ''personal'' website runs the software. Introduce yourself by your name and domain name
* 15 minutes - Personal introductions from people who did not demo on day 1. Introduce yourself by your name and domain name.
* 5 minutes - group photo '''before''' everyone leaves the room! This is likely the only time during the day that everyone will actually be in the same room
* 15 minutes - unconference scheduling, everybody gathers by the grid and proposes sessions, barcamp style.
* 1 hour sessions - as many as will fit before lunch, usually one or two sessions
* Lunch break - 1 hour is usually enough - day 1 is fine to send everyone off-site for food on their own
* 1 hour sessions - as many as will fit until the close of the day
* Group dinner - optional, preferably sponsored

=== Day 2 - Sunday ===
* 15 minutes - Intro to day 2, there may be some new people, but mostly introduce the "hack day" format and thank the sponsors
* 15 minutes - Personal introductions from new people who did not attend day 1. Introduce yourself by your name and domain name.
* 1 long hack session
* Lunch break - 1 hour - if possible, sponsored catered lunch is best since people are busy hacking and usually don't want to leave
* 1 long hack session
* 90 minutes - Demos - usually from 4 - 5:30pm
* Group photo - immediately after conclusion of demos, since this will be the only time everyone is in the same room
* 15-30 minutes - Community cleanup, everyone pitch in to help clean up the space
* Group dinner or afterparty - optional, preferably sponsored

== Notes ==
This is a place to collect thoughts on what worked well and what did not work well during past IndieWebCamp events. 

=== Successes ===
* Opening demos are a great way to introduce everyone to each other with lots of context
* Catered lunch for day 2 is ideal, so as not to break the flow of people who are building things. We have found that catered lunch for day 1 is not really needed. '''Agreed''': day 1 is social and day 2 is work, so this makes perfect sense. 
* Having a session on improving how new people can become part of IndieWeb was a fantastic start, as it served two purposes: 1. It educated those new to the more advanced concepts. 2. It set a roadmap for what people would try to accomplish and learn over the 2 day conference. Many people decided to implement WebMentions because of this session, as it was the next step on the chain. 

=== Things that didn't go well ===
* Forgetting to take a group photo when everyone is in the same room. It's almost impossible to gather everyone again except for the morning intros and closing demos. '''Solution''': take a photo both days right after introductions and before going to the un-conference grid. 
* On hack day, it's hard to get people to leave for lunch at a specific time since people are often in the middle of building something.
