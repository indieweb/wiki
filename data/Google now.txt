<p class="p-summary">'''<dfn>[https://www.google.com/landing/now/ Google now]</dfn>''' is a proprietary [[Google]] tool/service that  keeps track of events and shows information [[cards]] from various sources with updates as needed.</p>

It attempts to act somewhat as an automated "personal assistant".

== What type of cards does it show? ==
Updates within Google now are shown as cards:
* Boarding Pass - retrieved from [[Gmail]]
* Flight Information - from flights from boarding passes
* Package Tracking - retrieved from [[Gmail]]
* Sporting events (and scores) - manually added from the settings configuration
* Appointments - retrieved from [[Google Calendar]]
* Travel to your next destination - from airline confirmations emails in [[Gmail]]
* Weather - from Geolocation API on the device

This information is gleaned from any number of sources, from your Inbox, Calendar and also from web sites you visit frequently.
