'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/jf2 jf2]</dfn>''' is a working prototype of a simpler JSON serialization of [[microformats2]].

This example of jf2 contains an additional "wm-property" value that indicates the property that contains the primary relation of the webmention. In the example above, this is the "in-reply-to" property, but may also be the "like-of" or "repost-of" property.

== Implementations ==
=== webmention.io ===
[[webmention.io]] can return a list of mentions of a URL in jf2 format. For example, https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/07/digital-memories


=== socialstreams ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} has set up a stream service at http://stream.thatmustbe.us that can convert MF2 to JF2 and back again.  Code can be found on [https://github.com/dissolve/socialstream GitHub]
=== more implementations ===
* See: http://microformats.org/wiki/jf2#Implementations for more open source parsers, jf2 converters, consuming code, etc.
