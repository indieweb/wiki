"'''<dfn>About</dfn>'''" is a commonly occurring page or section on a site that provides an introduction, overview, or summary of the site. On a personal site, this would be usually be in the form of an expanded [[h-card]] about the person. About information can either be on a dedicated page, on every page (e.g. in a [[footer]]), or often on the site [[home page]].

The key part of the About is the <code>p-note</code> of the <code>h-card</code>, which attempts to introduce the site visitor to the person in a simple and plain manner. 

== Guidelines ==
A good About <code>p-note</code> should be brief. There is always the opportunity to expand later. This is not a resume (that's what [[h-resume]] is for). This is to introduce people to the author and owner of the site.

=== separate page ===
==== Jeena ====
{{jeena}} on https://jeena.net/about is the main h-card with all the detailed data which shouldn't be on the homepage because it is just too much.

==== Kartik ====
{{kartik}} on https://kartikprabhu.com/about#me is the main h-card with a <code>p-note</code> which reads -

"I think, discover, compute, make, build, code, design, write, paint, photograph, am! 

I study mathematical properties of black holes and their effects on other things in the Universe. I spend my spare time on photography and, sometimes, painting. I write short stories, and haikus on occasion. I am also excited by the wonderful ideas in web design, and play around with the them on this site."

There is a minimal h-card with photo and name in the footer of the site on all pages that links to the full one using <code>u-url u-uid</code>.
