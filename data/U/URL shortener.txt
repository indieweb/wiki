{{stub}}

'''<dfn>URL shortener</dfn>''' is a service that turns a typical longer URL, like a [[permalink]], into a much shorter URL, typically using a [[short domain]], often per-site both for some silos, and several indieweb sites.

== Why ==

* URL shorteners help you make better use of limited characters in editing tools where you would like to share a link but are restricted by a character count.

== Criticism ==

* If you use an external URL shortener, you are beholden to their service being active and working. If the URL shortener becomes inactive, existing URLs created may be broken.
* "Aside from search engines, I canâ€™t think of any other type of website that could disable so many links on so much of the internet in one fell swoop than a URL shortening service." [https://rubenerd.com/urltea-trim-scary/ urlTea now tr.im, this stuff is scary]

== Libraries ==
Open source libraries and implementations to run your own URL shortener:
