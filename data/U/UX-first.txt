'''<dfn>UX-first</dfn>''' is an approach to making a [[projects | software project]] by focusing on [[UX]] first, as opposed to [[plumbing]].

By focusing on UX instead of plumbing, you'd get better experience in the end, the one that is less constrained by what's easy to implement. For example, drag-n-drop for adding an image to the document is easy to use, while being not-so-easy to implement.
