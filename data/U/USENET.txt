'''<dfn>USENET</dfn>''' (or '''<dfn>user's network</dfn>''')  is a non-centralized computer network for the discussion of topics and the sharing of files (binaries) via newsgroups using [[NNTP]]. Many people historically had a USENET feed from their [[ISP]], but this is now uncommon. USENET is historically significant. 

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{cweiske}} uses leafnode to keep a long-term archive of some newsgroups at home.
* {{mat.tl}} is still actively using USENET.

* [[NNTP]]
* [[SDF]] a [[tilde]] service that provides a USENET feed.
* [[BBS]] often provided USENET feeds
* [https://olduse.net olduse.net] a project that resurrects USENET a year at a time from archives, offering users a chance to read the archives in real time.

** On the “extremely high quality of the clients available for Usenet, as opposed to those for current social media” going in on how subscriptions used to work, how threads were natively supported, pick-and-read-mode letting the user chose what to spend time on, and Scorefiles for training the [[reader]] application on what was important for the user.
