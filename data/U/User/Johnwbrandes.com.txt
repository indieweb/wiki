I’m John Brandes. My site is where I keep a running record of what I’m noticing and learning—work, family life, and the small moments that stick with me.

I’ve spent 20+ years around sales and hiring, and I also run SalesBountyHunter. But I try to keep the website human: reflections, practical takeaways, and a few personal stories mixed in.
