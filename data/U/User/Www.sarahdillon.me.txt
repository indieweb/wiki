===Doing===
* Figure out how to integrate microblogging into my posting workflow

===TO DO/ ITCH===
* Figure out how to add h-entry markup for existing posts
* Try checking my site again in indiewebify.me  --> h-card is not being found for my site, even though I have a h-card widget installed, and have inserted the h-card code in my header.

===Done===
* Installed independent publisher child theme from github==> currently reverted to Genesis Frmwk.
* Figured out how to post to Twitter from my site
* Figured out how to remove the visible microformatting code from the author line on the blog posts on my site ==> workaround: decided to change themes which resolved the issue
* Forced my site to load securely via htaccess file
* Tried to figure out Quill - getting a 'not authorised' error sometimes when posting
* Found out my domain host is stripping stuff from my headers that causes authorisation pblms, they won't change this for security reasons. Sidestepping this via Apache is in the "Too Hard" basket for me.
