===Doing===
* Figure out if/how to integrate microblogging via micro.blog into my posting workflow. If I can do it with minimal adjustment to my current website setup, then I'll give it a go. Otherwise, it goes on the backburner.

===TO DO/ ITCH===
* One last pass at figuring out whether it's worth microblogging via my website, using micro.blog. Level of itch on this is not that high.

===Done===
* Installed independent publisher child theme from github==> currently reverted to Genesis Frmwk.
* Figured out how to post to Twitter from my site
* Figured out how to remove the visible microformatting code from the author line on the blog posts on my site ==> workaround: decided to change themes which resolved the issue
* Forced my site to load securely via htaccess file
* Tried to figure out Quill - getting a 'not authorised' error sometimes when posting
* Found out my domain host is stripping stuff from my headers that causes authorisation pblms, they won't change this for security reasons. Sidestepping this via Apache is in the "Too Hard" basket for me.
