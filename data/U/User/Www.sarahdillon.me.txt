===Doing===
* Figure out how to integrate microblogging into my posting workflow

===TO DO/ ITCH===
* Figure out how to add h-entry markup for existing posts

===Done===
* Installed independent publisher child theme from github
* Figure out how to post to Twitter from my site
* Figure out how to remove the visible microformatting code from the author line on the blog posts on my site ==> workaround: decided to change themes which resolved the issue
* Force my site to load securely via htaccess file
* r
