== Hello ==


I'm a complete noob at this, still trying to get my site off the ground but I'm really interested in my website being my very own space on the internet which I can use to experiment, learn and publish.

Update 2 February 2020: Finally after being locked out of indieauth for months, I '''*finally*''' managed to get back in. I think the problem was that my webpage had multiple entries for indieauth authorization endpoints. Some came from the plugin, and I think I had added others to a Custom HTML widget. In anycase, my website now at least has barebones indie web compliance. 

I told you I was a n00b.
