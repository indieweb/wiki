== About My Website == 
My first blog post was hosted on blogspot, back in 2007. During 2010's tried another blogging platform, the likes of Wordpress, and tumblr (bought my own domain too). In 2020's tried to self-host an app using my own server, included writefreely, my first self-hosted app for blogging, until recently, I want more of my website, and decided to learn basic html, css and another programming language. 

Now, I landed on a static site generator, powered by Hugo using my own theme, contains personal notes that might be useful for my own reminder. Still trying to implement Indieweb specs into my website, and still not sure what is. 

Since I've been using Hugo, I decided to make my own Micropub server, and I got my Indieauth and webmention server as well, after many failed attempts of course.
