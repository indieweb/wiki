I am '''Martijn'''. Once upon a time I followed an online lesson in HTML on my grandfather’s computer. Then I built websites on MSN Groups (R.I.P.) and [[GeoCities]] (R.I.P.). From March 2016 to March 2017, I was working professionally with [[PHP]] in the Netherlands. Besides that I work mostly with front-end technologies in my spare time.

Very interested in tools for [https://www.multilingualweb.eu/about-the-project a multilingual web]. I speak Dutch (<code>nl-NL</code>), English(<code>en-GB</code>), and Swedish (<code>sv-SE</code>) fluently. I have a good understanding of German (<code>de-DE</code>) as well. [[accessibility|Accessibility]] and crazy loopholes in specs are hobbies of mine.

You might know me as '''Zegnat''' from [[discuss|the IndieWeb chat]]. In fact, some would say [https://twitter.com/fletcher0xFF/status/877914348449972224 I am the IRC rebel fleet leader]. The explanation behind the name Zegnåt (note the diacritical mark) is [http://wiki.zegnat.net/but-what-does-it-mean available on my personal wiki].

== My [[FAQ#What_is_a_personal_website|personal website]] ==

It is <a href="https://vanderven.se/martijn/"><code>vanderven.se/martijn/</code></a>.
* '''All lowercase.''' This is important because directory names are case-sensitive on the server.
* '''With a trailing <code>/</code>.''' Less important, but [[canonical]]. It is a directory.
* '''Serving [[HTTP]].''' Plans to move to [[HTTPS]] are being discussed.
** The domain will not be moves to HTTPS until it is moved to a new hosting company or Binero offers free certificates.
** As of 2017-12-07 it is hosted at Hetzner and serving HTTPS!

=== History ===

The domain name <code>vanderven.se</code> was first registered in 2006 to bring all of the family’s email under a single provider. Since 2008 information about me has been available on <code>vanderven.se/martijn/</code>. (Though I had a short-lived fling with <code>martijn.vanderven.se</code> as well.)

The website and email were [[web hosting|hosted]] by [https://www.clichehosting.com/ Cliche] (DK) from 2006 until it was moved to [https://www.binero.se/ Binero] (SE) somewhere during 2013.

The content of <code>vanderven.se/martijn/</code> has stayed very static from early 2014 to mid-2017, with only minor iterative presentation changes. During [[2017|IWS 2017]] it was drastically rebuilt both in information contained, its markup, and its presentation.

=== The 2017 Rebuild ===

The rebuild not only tries to do a better job of reconsolidating all my online identities through [[rel-me]] links, but also adds an additional heap of personal information like length, weight, [[pronouns]], and [[relationship status]]. The reasoning behind some of this data is that is was always available to people through other [[silos]], but never through a canonical representation.

<blockquote><span style="font-size:300%;position:absolute;margin-left:-.4em">“</span>Facebook should not contain more information about me than my own homepage.”</blockquote>

As an experiment (almost) all data is added to the [[microformats]] representation of the page, all living within a single giant [[h-card]]. I am always looking for more information I could add.

== My [[feed|activity feed]] ==

Will be published on <a href="https://licit.li/"><code>licit.li</code></a>.

=== History ===

The domain name <code>licit.li</code> was first registered in 2012 to become a [[personal domain]] (minus the use to represent myself).

* As of 2015-06-01 it is hosted by [https://uberspace.de/ Uberspace.de] and development has restarted to join the [[indieweb|IndieWeb movement]].
* As of 2015-07-29 it accepts [[webmentions]] through <code>wm.licit.li</code>.
** This is gone since 2016-09-24 when it moved to a new hosting instance and the subdomain was dropped.
** At some point quickly thereafter it started to point the webmentions to the endpoint on <code>vanderven.se</code>.
* The new system goes live with [https://licit.li/57e7e7a728e78 its first post] on 2016-09-25.
* As of 2016-11-23, posts mention their own [[permalink|permalinks]]. Most [[reader|readers]] will now be compatible with the [[h-feed]].
* The [https://licit.li/583823e38637e first post] using [[tags]] went live on 2016-11-25.
* The [https://licit.li/58518f473dfa6 first checkin post] ([[checkin#Martijn_van_der_Ven|documented on the wiki]]) happened on 2016-12-14.
* The [https://licit.li/593fa571d6b80 first event post] ([[event#Martijn_van_der_Ven|documented on the wiki]]) happened on 2017-06-13.
* As of 2017-11-06 it is hosted on a [[VPS]] at [https://www.hetzner.com/ Hetzner] to give me more control over the tech stack it runs on.
