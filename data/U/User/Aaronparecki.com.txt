== indieweb support ==
See [[p3k]]

=== History ===
* 2012-12 began receiving Pingbacks using [[webmention.io]] (called pingback.me at the time)
* 2013-05-26 added [[webmention]] support
** using a built-in webmention endpoint
** recognizes mentions, replies and likes via [[h-entry]] markup
** sending webmentions automatically for new posts
* 2013-06-23 began displaying count of received comments/likes/mentions on posts

== working on ==
=== specs ===
I'm working on building the following [[building-blocks|building blocks]] of the Indie Web
* [[Webmention]] specification and extensions such as [[private webmention]]
* [[IndieAuth]] specification
* [[Micropub]] specification
* [[WebSub]] specification
* [[Microsub]] specification

=== personal website ===
I'm building indieweb functionality into my personal site, [[p3k]] at [https://aaronparecki.com aaronparecki.com]

=== indieweb community ===
I build and maintain several things used by the IndieWeb community.

* [[this-week-in-the-indieweb|This Week in the IndieWeb]] - an automatically generated weekly newsletter about the IndieWeb community
* [[wiki/|this wiki]] 

==== to do ====
Below is my todo list for the IndieWeb community tools:

* <s>Install auth plugin on etherpad.indieweb.org to use logged-in cookie to set username</s>
* Install [[Calagator]] at events.indieweb.org 
** Update Calagator to prevent adding new events unless logged in (via lasso auth)
** [https://github.com/calagator/calagator/issues/534 github issue to discuss requirements]
* Update chat.indieweb.org
** should know about logged-in users to automatically set the nickname when joining the web chat
** show notifications (red dot in channel name, and/or browser notifications) when your nick is mentioned
** show messages left via a !tell
* <s>update [[2018/Baltimore]] event pages to consolidate schedule/info as discussed after IWC Austin</s>
** <s>2018.indieweb.org/baltimore is canonical event page, wiki has schedule grid and detailed event info, tito registrations embedded on 2018 page</s>

== figured out ==
Things I feel like I've figured out pretty well, have shipped on my own site, can depend on, and am available to help explain to others.
* [[POSSE]], in particular:
** [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSE to Twitter]]
* [[webmention]] and [[pingback]]
* [[IndieAuth]], in particular:
** Building your own [[authorization-endpoint|authorization endpoint]] and [[token-endpoint|token endpoint]]
* [[Micropub]]

== itching ==
Below are some general itches that are before the stage of turning into action items for [[p3k]] or other projects. For a more immediate list of things that will end up in my site soon, see: [[p3k#Itching]]

* Issues
** I sometimes use GitHub issues for projects where there isn't even any code in the repo. I'd like to replace this with a self-hosted version of an issue tracker, that functions much like GitHub issues.
** Should be able to have other people create and comment on issues via Webmention, as well as log in to the site using [[IndieAuth]] to comment in the case they can't post a Webmention comment.
* Events - a community event calendar and/or aggregator. 
** These are kind of two separate things, but related. Calagator is an example of this hybrid approach.
** I plan to use this to run the [https://oauth.net/events/ event listing on oauth.net]
* [[Shoebox]] - a photo/media server, used as a [[Media Endpoint]] and to replace my use of Flickr, and Soundcloud
* Slides / Presentations
** I've been posting slide decks on [https://speakerdeck.com/aaronpk Speakerdeck] because it imports PDFs well and provides a nice interface
** I do host some HTML slides on a subdomain https://slides.aaronparecki.com/2018/ but it could use an improved navigation system
** My [https://aaronparecki.com/presentations presentation] posts could use some improvement to better feature the slides and videos and session descriptions, and I also need an easier way to post those since I didn't post any in 2018 for some reason
* private groups - wanting to communicate privately with some group of people. Since 2014 I have been finding private/secret Facebook groups very useful for certain things. How does this translate onto our individual sites?
* [[mention-app|Mention App]]
* [[kirby-login-app|Kirby login app]] (needs a new name)
* archive to wayback machine
** some time after publishing posts on my site, send a ping to the wayback machine to trigger archiving it
* Hosting my own conference videos that are currently only hosted on YouTube (https://backpedal.tv)
* publish some sort of indicator of activity on private (and public) git repos, so that my day permalinks where I am inside working all day don't look so empty [https://aaronparecki.com/2018/02/02]
* Getting more data out of Apple Health
* Venues
** Venues should get their own URLs on my site so I can see all checkins I've posted at a venue
** Tie my checkins to local venues
** Create "lists" of venues, with tips specific to the entry in the list ([https://foursquare.com/aaronpk/list/portland-highball example])
** Show lists grouped by city, like [[Foursquare]]
** Allow people to subscribe to notifications of my checkins at either particular regions of a map, or particular venues (e.g. let me know when you get to this area during the bar crawl)
* gopher server for IndieNews as a follow-up to http://metatalk.metafilter.com/24019/Direct-your-gopher-client-to-gopher-gophermetafiltercom

=== projects that need to be renamed ===
I've had a bad habit of naming projects after the spec they implement. It has become apparent that this has caused more confusion than it has benefits. The worst case of this is indieauth.com, since it conflates the spec with the service that I run.

* indieauth.com ([https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth.com/issues/138 issue])
** split into two separate services
** 1) indielogin.com [https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth.com/milestone/1 service for developers] to handle [[web sign-in]] 
** 2) myindieauth.com [https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth.com/milestone/2 user delegation tool] as a user, you can use it as your [[authorization endpoint]] for [[micropub]]
* possibly webmention.io ([https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/78 issue])
** receives webmentions for you
** provides an API (and potentially a UI in the future) for displaying webmentions

== private posts ==
Some brainstorming on private posts:

* I want to let people log in to my site, and then they can see things that are not posted publicly.
* Should additional posts appear on my home page once someone is signed in?
* Should there be a separate feed of posts that are visible only to the person who is signed in?
* I want to make some posts visible to groups of people, but might not want them to know which group they're in.
* Need some way to visually indicate that a post is not public, so that people know they should not share it as they would a public post. (screenshot or otherwise)
* Some posts I want to show the context they are posted in (e.g. POSSEing photos of my cat in the #animals channel in the XOXO Slack), but this applies also to public posts

=== Checkins ===
I have been using Foursquare consistently for a number of years now, and it is the authoritative source of every venue I've been. I know that if I have never checked in somewhere before on Foursquare, I actually have never been there before. 

While my Foursquare feed is currently public, I'm reconsidering whether I want my indie checkins feed to be completely public. I may end up being more selective about the checkins I make public instead, and keep my full checkin history private. 

Examples of public checkins often include a short note from me along with the venue for things like checking in to a venue for a public event, or checking in somewhere to say I'm going to be hacking there for a while inviting people to join me. When I check in to lunch two blocks away from my office, it's not that I don't want anyone to know I'm there, it's just that probably nobody cares and there usually isn't anything actionable that would come from them knowing anyway. Usually I'm getting something to go and don't have time to stay and talk anyway.

=== OwnYourSquare ===
Foursquare provides:
* a push API so I can pesos checkins to my site in real time
* lots of my friends still use it
* the app still provides fun tidbits when I check in, like "you've been here 5 weeks in a row", etc
* searching for venues is difficult to implement from scratch, and I'm not entirely happy with the OSM data, so using foursquare venues continues to be highest quality

Really getting annoyed that when Foursquare venues are renamed, merged or deleted, my own history is changed.

* Figure out how to represent a "checkin" on my own site (see [http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/10/22/1/creating-content-on-the-indie-web Creating content on the Indie Web] for more thoughts)
* Figure out how to store venues on my site (venue IDs, nice slugs, ???)
* Build a basic interface for viewing "checkin" data
* Syndicate out to Foursquare and possibly Facebook (although Facebook recently deprecated checkins in favor of attaching venues to notes)
* Repurpose the [https://github.com/tijoinc/Checkie Checkie] app to search my site for venues and post checkins to my site first
* Download all Foursquare history and create checkins on my site retroactively
