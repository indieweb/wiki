Here is a chat user experiment:

{{chat-user|1=Bucci.onl_about.html|2=abucci|3=US/Eastern|4=https://www.bucci.onl/assets/img/blue-feather-100x100.png}}

And a sparkline experiment:
<span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline| http://example.com/your-profile-image.jpg}} [[User:Bucci.onl_about.html|Anthony Bucci]]</span>

So far every iteration of these that I've tried has not worked. What's especially frustrating is that the User: part of the URL that the wiki uses for my username does not work. The issue seems to be that my home page with my h-card is https://bucci.onl/about.html, and that is what I've used to log in. I chose that particular URL because the Jekyll template I'm using does not have a convenient way to edit the landing page--it's almost entirely generated--but editing individual pages like about.html is convenient. The wiki converted this into a username "Bucci.onl about.html" with a space in it. The space appears to be problematic for the chat-user and sparkline templates. 

It seems to me that there should be a "single source of truth" for the username, and that it should be the URL you use to sign in. I should be able to put that URL in any field, and the software backend should take care of whatever processing is necessary to make that work.

I'm also a bit confused about why I am re-entering this information in a wiki page when it is already on the about.html page in h-card format. Shouldn't it be possible to auto-populate most of this information, like the infobox, chat-user, and sparkling, from your h-card?

<div class="p-summary">
