Here is a chat user experiment:

{{chat-user|1=Bucci.onl_about.html|2=abucci2|3=US/Eastern|4=https://www.bucci.onl/assets/img/blue-feather-100x100.png}}

And a sparkline experiment:
<span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline| http://example.com/your-profile-image.jpg}} [[User:Bucci.onl_about.html|Anthony Bucci]]</span>

I'm a bit confused about why I am re-entering this information in a wiki page when it is already on the about.html page in h-card format. Shouldn't it be possible to auto-populate most of this information, like the infobox, chat-user, and sparkling, from your h-card?

<div class="p-summary">
{{Infobox person
|name = Anthony Bucci
|url = https://bucci.onl/abucci.html
|photo_url = https://www.bucci.onl/assets/img/blue-feather-100x100.png
|pronouns = he/him
|summary = Hi, I'm Anthony and I'm a computer scientist
|elsewhere =
|contact =
|chatname = abucci2
}}
</div>
