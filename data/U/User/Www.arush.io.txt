== Itches ==
* Create a more seemless workflow for posting content to my site to help transition from silos
* Create a workflow for mobile that is also accessible so I can post from my phone while using VoiceOver, also to help transition from silos
* Add Microformats 2 support to a Genesis child theme to take advantage of the Genesis framework's built-in accessibility
* Work on backfeeding all my content from still-operating silos

== Working On ==
* Creating a blogroll for my site
* Finding Indieweb community members to follow
* Customizing my site's feeds to separate post kinds and for better syndication to micro.blog
