'''<dfn>Brent Terrazas</dfn>''' has been running various sites like his own personal blog at <a href="https://brentter.com" class="u-url url" rel="me">Brentter.com</a> for over 20 years. His TLDR is: Self-taught programmer, has worked for both traditional advertising agencies as well as interactive/online focused development shops then eventually started working in more traditional tech company environments as a developer and project manager. Became a certified Scrum Master 15 or so years ago because that was the cool thing to do though he has not renewed it since. Preferred languages are Python and Go. Favorite flavor of OS is Debian.
