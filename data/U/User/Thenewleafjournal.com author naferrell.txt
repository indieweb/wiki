== Overview ==

I am the administrator and editor of, and writer for, ''The New Leaf Journal'' - an online magazine I started with a friend dedicated to publishing our interesting content. Most of my work appears on ''The New Leaf Journal''. I also run a [https://buttondown.email/newsletterleafjournal newsletter publication] related to the main site.

== My Content ==

I write about whatever interests me. For that reason, there is no common topic for my 300+ ''New Leaf Journal'' articles. Below, you will find a representative sample of my content, organized into groups. These are not necessarily all of my favorite articles - but rather a selection that offers an idea of what I write about. Within sections, articles are ordered chronologically. I have also organized groups of articles into [https://thenewleafjournal.com/new-leaf-journal-series-hub/ series on my website].

== Itches ==

Below are some priorities I have for improving ''The New Leaf Journal'' (updated 7/10/2021).

* Remove unused shortcodes
* Implement events page
* Test plugin for new glossary page
* Finish drafting and post guest submissions page
* Study new solutions for including on-site microblog to replace outdated implementation of the feature - this includes using RSS feed from external source
* Create sub-categories for organizing photo-based posts
* Completely revamp site tag structure
* Study implementation of other IndieWeb plugins beyond base plugin and determine whether they would work/make sense on site - emphasis on later study of ActivityPub plugin
* Work on external link-building ideas, including separate BuddyPress platform related to main site
* Most important - continue working to publish good content
