I'm currently setting up my website. I have web-sign-in set up, as well as a representative hcard. I've got a nice lil post-making system going. I want to get comments operational and I want to make a infeed backend where I can log in and see a feed of posts from various rss feeds, social media accounts and other indieweb websites.

I had some trouble setting up a websignin, because I don't have an account on github or twitter, and I don't really want to make one just for the sake of websignin. It seemed counter-intuitive to make an account on a silo in order to escape from the very same things. Thankfully I came across [[selfauth]] which is more in-house and works perfectly for my situation.
