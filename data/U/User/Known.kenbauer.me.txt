Ken is this guy who happens to be an associate professor in Computing at the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey in Guadalajara.

I've been lurking in the IndieWeb shadows for years and decided to actually create this page in February 2019. Perhaps my silo-quit announcement on my blog spurred that as well as my recent attempt to move my blogging and micro-blogging to a self-hosted instance of Known.

You can find me at https://known.kenbauer.me
