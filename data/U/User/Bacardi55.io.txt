== Introduction ==

Bacardi55 is a Team Lead and Solutions Architect during the day and a lazy "Dev Sec Ops" at night with a passion for selfhosting and data privacy. Free and Open Source advocate since 2005, I sporadically write (mostly tech related) Blog or Gemlog (mostly [https://geminiprotocol.net/ Gemini] related) posts and share bookmarks on my website: https://bacardi55.io.

== IndieWeb setup ==

My website is a static site managed by [https://gohugo.io hugo] and deployed in a server in my homelab. You can read more details on the [https://bacardi55.io/pages/colophon/ Colophon page] or [https://bacardi55.io/pages/blog-history/ read about its history].
I also wrote about [https://bacardi55.io/2024/01/29/indieweb-adventure-first-steps/ my first steps in the IndieWeb world].
