== Itches ==
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* ✅ Figure out a [[URL design]] for my posts
* Start posting [[notes]] (posts for me) manually at [[permalinks]]
* Continually verify my site in indiewebify.me
* ✅ Add a URL to my article template
* Look into categories for both posts and articles
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site

== Working On ==
* I will add a URL to the article template next
* I will then try to add microblog support (probably with a Clojure micro service)
