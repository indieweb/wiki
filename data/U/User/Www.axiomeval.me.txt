== Itches ==
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* ✅ Figure out a [[URL design]] for my posts
* ✅ Add a category pages mechanism (tags)
* ✅ Add p-category support
* ✅ Start posting [[notes]] (posts for me) manually at [[permalinks]]
* Continually verify my site in indiewebify.me
* ✅ Add a URL to my article template
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site
* ✅ Add Micropub note/post support (probably with a Clojure microservice)
* ✅ Fix my site on mobile (currently no nav bar)
* ✅ Add Micropub support for replies

== Working On ==
* ✅ Add a URL to the article template next
* ✅ Add a category pages mechanism (tags)
* ✅ Add p-category support
* ✅ Add Micropub note/post support (probably with a Clojure microservice)

== IndieWeb and linked web presence progress so far ==
* Used my own old static site creation software (Silk Web Toolkit)
* Added notes support (for some reason I'm calling them posts - probably a mistake)
* Added articles support
* Added micro format support for IndieWebify.me compatibility (minimum compatibility for now)
* Added p-category support in articles and posts
* Added headers to my site for: indieauth (token and authorisation), microsub (via aperture) and the beginnings of micropub (which is what I hope to get into soon)
* Added a primitive category pages mechanism with a javascript client side search for now (there are some bugs - duplicate results etc at the moment)
* Added WebMention to posts and articles
* Made use of Webmention to comment on my own posts when updating (better than update in place)
* Added Micropub support for notes/posts with a Clojure microservice
* Added Micropub support for replies
* I have opted to use brid.gy to post to Mastodon (which for me is a hosted service with my own domain axiomeval.social)
* My brid.gy use is currently manual in terms of publishing to Mastodon
