== Itches ==
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* ✅ Figure out a [[URL design]] for my posts
* Start posting [[notes]] (posts for me) manually at [[permalinks]]
* Continually verify my site in indiewebify.me
* ✅ Add a URL to my article template
* Look into categories for both posts and articles
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site

== Working On ==
* ✅ I will add a URL to the article template next
* I will then try to add microblog support (probably with a Clojure micro service)

== IndieWeb and linked web presence progress so far ==
* Using my own old static site creation software
* Added notes support (for some reason I'm calling them posts - probably a mistake)
* Added articles support
* Added micro format support for IndieWebify.me compatibility (minimum compatibility for now)
* Added headers to my site for: indieauth (token and authorisation), microsub (via aperture) and the beginnings of micro pub (which is what I hope to get into soon)
* I have opted to use brid.gy to post to Mastodon (which for me is a hosted service with my own domain axiomeval.social)
* My brid.gy use is currently manual in terms of publishing to Mastodon
* I have chosen to not integrate WebMention on my site for now
