== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Chris. I've been on the internet since at least 1992 when HTML was the "thing". PHP is my primary web-based programming language, though I'm trying to sharpen my JavaScript skills to better break all the things. 

I helped to start the Los Angeles chapter of the [[Homebrew Website Club]] in 2016 and helped to organize [[2016/LA|IndieWebCamp LA 2016]]. If you're in the area, we're happy to have you join us or help out by volunteering.

== Websites ==
I use a [[multi-site_indieweb|multi-site strategy]]. My primary site ([http://boffosocko.com BoffoSocko.com]) is powered by [[WordPress]] while I also maintain a secondary self-hosted [http://stream.boffosocko.com/ "social stream"] powered by [[Known]]. I'm also running two other [[WordPress]] installs [http://boffosocko.com/publishing Boffo Socko Publishing] and [http://www.boffosockobooks.com Boffo Socko Books] that are indieweb compatible in various stages. I also have experience with [[Drupal]] and a few other PHP-based [[CMS|CMSes]].

I have an open [[Known]] instance at [http://known.boffosocko.com known.boffosocko.com]that Indieweb users are welcome to [http://known.boffosocko.com/account/register create an account] on to try out. This may be particularly useful for either newcomers to HWC or IndieWebCamps who need something to play around with or kick the tires on. It has [[OAuth]] enabled, so users could potentially [[POSSE]] to from their own Known instance.

==== Wiki ====
If you want to add a [[sparkline]] like the following for {{chrisaldrich}}, just copy/paste: <code><nowiki>{{chrisaldrich}}</nowiki></code> into the page where you would like it to appear. (To set up your own, see: [[Template:sparkline#How_to_make_a_small_h-card_template|How to make a small h-card template]]. For more details see also [[wikify#Wikify_yourself]].)

* Play around with other [http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/plugins/community/ community plugins]

== Finished ==
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site
* Added h-card to site (previously only had mf1 hcard)
* Set up an IndieWebCamp outpost with regular HWC meetings in Los Angeles
** [https://indieweb.org/events/2016-07-27-homebrew-website-club First meeting on 7/27/16]
* Introduced IndieWeb concepts at DrupalCampLA at UC Irvine in 2015

=== WordPress ===
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* Updated to more modern responsive theme that is as IndieWeb compatible as possible
* Set up [[Micropub]] endpoint and [[ownyourgram]] to publish photos to my own site.
* Updated [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this IndieWeb Press This] on WordPress site; made some suggestions on GitHub for changes
* 3/25/16 Finished setting up my first [[podcast]] feed by uploading [[audio]] files to [http://www.boffosockobooks.com Boffo Socko Books].
* Configure [https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/ SNAP] and compare it with current set up which simply uses JetPack publicize
** Added in mid-March '16 and seems to work well, particularly with [https://github.com/dshanske/syndication-links Syndication Links]
*** Tumblr certainly has far better support in SNAP than Jetpack
*** Twitter seems roughly equivalent
*** Nice that SNAP allows easy secondary posting later on
*** Facebook will require some tweaking and formatting, but seems workable and has more flexibility
*** Still using JetPack for G+ as it requires paid SNAP pro version; SNAP pro only works without 2-factor authentication turned on.
* Given that [[Bridgy]] seems to be giving [[webmentions]] for my Twitter @username and assigning them to the homepage of my domain, figure out a way to "archive" these comments into a category other than "approved" (so they don't show up on the homepage), or spam or trash (where they'd be automatically deleted/purged.) See https://codex.wordpress.org/Comments_Screen 
** For the moment, I'm assigning them to http://boffosocko.com/twitter-mentions/ (perhaps there's a better answer down the road); created 301 redirect to /mentions in 8/16
* 5/16/16 Streamlined micropub PESOS of Instagram and made modifications to site to allow Bridgy to import comments/likes.
* 5/17/16 Set up PESOS of checkins via [[OwnYourCheckin]]
* Late June: Added Hypothes.is support and plugin for keeping notes.
* 6/16: Finished PESOS of all Instagram data so that I own the entirety of what's in that silo.
* Early July: fixed issues with Instagram PESOS and finalized workflow
* Attended WordCamp OC in early July '16
* Registered for WordCamp LA and submitted IndieWeb session proposal
* 7/14/16 Added documentation to Syndication Links
* 7/19/16 This week got the [https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/4399 sharedaddy JetPack "like" functionality] to filter out of syndicated copies to Tumblr.
* 7/20/16 Added mf2 support for [[recipe]] via [https://github.com/chrisaldrich/jetpack/pull/1/commits/f914ebe3bd573d1d6d42c5b7752bf26c41448a3b JetPack code] which I hope will be [https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/4470 included in the future].
7/29/16: [http://boffosocko.com/2016/07/29/web-based-push-notifications-with-pushpad/ Added] web-based [[push notifications]] for future post updates
* 8/20/16: I've been using POSSE for Tumblr for quite a while now, but I finished importing and displaying of all past Tumblr data, prior to POSSE efforts.
* 12/18/16: [http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/18/rss-feeds-a-follow-up-on-my-indieweb-commitment-2017/ Figure out] how to better segregate content on site and make subsections of it more easily subscribe-able 
** See also https://indieweb.org/publics#IndieWeb_Thoughts
* December (?) 2016: Fix custom code so that auto-posting from [[ownyourgram]] or other services like Woodwind doesn't automatically syndicate out to Facebook, Twitter, et al. via Jetpack in WordPress. This [http://jetpack.me/2013/10/15/ever-accidentally-publicize-a-post-that-you-didnt/ Jetpack] functions.php snippet should work, but I'm having problems with it not triggering things anyway. I suspect it's the e-content microformat not closing early enough in my theme. - Essentially created a functions.php filter that prevents posts to particular categories from auto-emailing and changed my syndication workflow subtly.
* December 2016: Started posting more [[listen]], [[watch]] posts and occasional [[jams]] after reconfiguring a work-in-progress set of bookmarklets for Post Kinds plugin
* 12/31/16: Find better integrated reader to go with WordPress. Play around more with IndieWeb feed readers [[Woodwind]] (as [[Monocle]] "died"), [[WhisperFollow]], and [[PressForward]]. Decided in [http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/31/pressforward-as-an-indieweb-wordpress-based-rss-feed-reader-pocketinstapaper-replacement/ December 2016] to use PressForward as my daily tool.
* Check out Bridgy Publish functionality either in [https://github.com/dshanske/bridgy-publish repo] or [https://wordpress.org/plugins/bridgy-publish/ WordPress.org]
* 1/17: Added [https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-location/ Simple Location] plugin to display maps and location information which moves me closer to better supporting [[checkins]] (6/9/16 {{GWG}} said he will be coming back to this shortly; he revamped in December 2016.)
* 1/26/17 Fix issue of [[backfeed]] of Instagram account to WordPress (from 12/18/16)
* Early 2018 (fixed via plugin update) Comment walker for better separation of likes, comments, etc.
** [https://gist.github.com/miklb/f86ece1431283f1220e2735449678724 Example from miklb] has a facepile for likes
** [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-semantic-linkbacks/tree/seperate-comments-by-type semantic linkbacks branch for separating comments by type]
* Find a better way in WordPress to sort/differentiate between likes, comments, pingbacks, potentially using a facepile set up. {{GWG}} has [https://david.shanske.com/projects/indieweb/semantic-comments/ Semantic Comments] which may do this. He's also made a note that in addition to [https://github.com/dshanske/semantic-comments Github Semantic Comments] some of the relevant code lives in his theme [https://github.com/dshanske/mf2_s mf2_s]; [[Independent Publisher]] theme on GitHub (circa 5/15/16) has a custom comments.php that does an excellent job of doing this.

=== Known ===
* Set up a self-hosted [[Known]] site 
* Set up [[Woodwind]] and configured for use with [[Known]] - wrote about [http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/configuring-the-indieweb-rss-reader-woodwind-for-withknown configuring action urls for use with Known]
* Configure [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.daverix.urlforward URL forward app] to better integrate IndieWeb experience on Android mobile platform
** Played around for a bit and wrote [http://stream.boffosocko.com/2016/sharing-from-the-indieweb-on-mobile-android-with-apps-and post on URL Forward and competitor] - still has to be better way for using mobile and indieweb
* Updated to Known 0.9.2 on 4/30/16
