== Introduction ==
I started working on the web in 1992 as a grad student. One of my first projects, before the ubiquity of search engines, was a site listing and describing the best sites about artificial intelligence. I've been self-hosting cathieleblanc.com for a long time but have only recently begun thinking about self-hosting as a tool to help students change their relationship to knowledge production and consumption. I'm still working on fully articulating these ideas.

== Itches ==
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* Get Bridgy up and working
* Better understand the workflow for POSSE
* Develop mental map (in my head first and then visually for others) of how IndieWeb works

== Working On ==
* Bridgy on my site and in my mental map
