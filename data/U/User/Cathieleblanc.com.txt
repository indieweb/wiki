== Introduction ==
I started working on the web in 1992 as a grad student. One of my first projects, before the ubiquity of search engines, was a site listing and describing the best sites about artificial intelligence. I've been self-hosting cathieleblanc.com for a long time but have only recently begun thinking about self-hosting as a tool to help students change their relationship to knowledge production and consumption. I'm still working on fully articulating these ideas.

== Itches ==
* Better understand the workflow for POSSE
* Develop mental map (in my head first and then visually for others) of how IndieWeb works
* Develop a workflow that allows easy posting of different content types to different pages on my site

== Working On ==
* Using my site for content management for my classes
