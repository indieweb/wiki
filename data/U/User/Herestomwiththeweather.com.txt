== Indie web setup ==

I host [https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb jekyll-indieweb] on netlify and use travis-ci to send webmentions (using the mention-client-ruby gem). I receive webmentions using the built in support (setting webmention to true in config.yml).  I also use https://quill.p3k.io/ which posts to an instance of [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github webpage-micropub-to-github] which takes the incoming micropub request and turns it into a git commit acceptable to jekyll.
