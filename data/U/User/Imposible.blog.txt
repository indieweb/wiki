Hi! My name is Iv√°n E. Mendoza, right now, learning more about Indie Web and happy to join me to the movement. :D

=== Working on ===

* Re-launching my personal blog following IndieWeb principles. I will use this blog for personal topics, like book reviews, creative projects and personal writings. 
* Also, I'm re-launching my first website/blog as a journal, to keep a log of my journey as a web developer. I hope that the blog works as inspiration and reference for other developers on my country.
* Migrating other websites to a brand-new server, doing some improvements during the process.

=== 2023 commitments ===

* Set up my personal blogs to [[POSSE]].
* Start to write about (Indie)Web development and other ways to live our digital lives outside corporate [[silo|silos]].
* Translate to Spanish at least one IndieWeb plugins for WordPress.

=== My IndieWeb Setup ===
Coming soon.

=== About me ===
Web developer from Guatemala. Currently, I work as frontend developer in a private company and, in my free/time, I am volunteer in non-profit organizations that works on social development, education, and nutrition.
