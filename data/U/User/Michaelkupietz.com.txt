Mike has abandoned his presence here for the Indie<sup>2</sup>Web.<!-- the real deal is that within a few days of setting up the page, my own site suddenly plummetted irrecoverably in the Google search results for my own name. I have grown concerned. I don't know if it was a coincidence or not, but seeing as how I'm no longer active in chat or this site I'm going to start by disabling my content here, seeing if it fixes anything, and then, we'll go from there.
