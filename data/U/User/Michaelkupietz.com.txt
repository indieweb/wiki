It is I! This is the intro to the Indieweb.org User page for [https://michaelkupietz.com Mike Kupietz]

== Latest & Greatest* ==
By and large, recent updates appear on my site's [https://michaelkupietz.com/latest-news/ news page]. However, to help maintain my objective corporeal existence and keep my online presence from simply collapsing in on itself under its own concentrated, unary weight like a neutron star, I will occasionally add some new hilights here.  
* As it's December, my [https://michaelkupietz.com/?p=12640 interactive pure CSS holiday lights] are back up on my website. However, this year, they're debuting as a free WordPress plugin for anyone to enjoy on their own site, available on my Github at https://github.com/kupietools/ktwp-wp-plugin-css-holiday-lights/ .
* I recently wrote my 1,000th [https://michaelkupietz.com/literally-hundreds-capsule-reviews/ capsule movie review].
* Slowly having been overtaken by the pernicious influence of the Indieweb hive mind and its fashionable social media bent, I now haz launched a "[https://michaelkupietz.com/blog-feed/ blog view]" of the website, which a chronological feed of all articles, but also containing "blog post" entries, small or timely posts that don't merit being permanently archived in the main site articles. This may be a precursor to more social features like comments, webmentions, and a "buy me a coffee" button. No, just kidding about that last one. Blog posts can also be seen by themselves on their [https://michaelkupietz.com/blog-posts category page].
* I've slowly added [https://michaelkupietz.com/draggable-elements-wordpress-plugin/ draggability] to a few sundry site UI elements as an easter egg. G'head, start tugging on stuff. 
* Demo of  "Big Diffr" ([https://github.com/kupietools/big-diffr Github]) is live: a tool for quickly comparing numerous subsequent revisions if you're working with, say, a tool or coding assistant that is less than entirely reliable about maintaining your code integrity from edit to edit: https://michaelkupietz.com/demos/big-diffr/ 
* I stuck a comprehensive list of CSS units up because I couldn't find a single page that had one: https://michaelkupietz.com/comprehensive-list-of-css-units/
* I turned my "CSS Sun" demo into a live demo of simulating point lighting and dynamic shadow parallax with CSS and javascript. https://michaelkupietz.com/offsite/point-lighting-effect.html
* I made a fun pure CSS blazing August sun in Codepen at https://codepen.io/kupietz/pen/GgpmRoy
* My site is navigable via an "expert mode" command line interface at https://michaelkupietz.com/cli.html
