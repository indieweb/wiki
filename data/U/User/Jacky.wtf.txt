I really enjoy working on software and making it more simple to use for anyone interested. That said, I really like keeping my content on my own terms. You'll see that a lot of sections below might be out of date but will point to parts of my personal site that you can reference for more up to date bits.

At the time of writing, https://jacky.wtf, my personal site is [https://indieweb.org/IndieMark#Level_1 Level 1]. However, work is being done to skip to Level 3 by means of [[Koype]].

= Reasoning for IndieWeb =
I (Jacky) can't remember how I stumbled upon the IndieWeb. My blog posts did show a transition but now it's become something I'm very passionate about. It's potentially the tooling we can use to help remove the heavy corporate influence in social media as well as making for more organic and natural places to be ourselves on this big world wide Web.

= Projects =
I work on a few projects to make my experience of the IndieWeb more pleasing and easier.

* [[IndieMark Scanner]] - stalled on this project
* [[Koype]] and [[Koype Hub]]
* [[Fortress]]
* <code>libindieweb-cpp</code> - Native (Qt/C++) library to talk to IndieWeb sites

= Working On =
You can see what I'm up to right now at https://jacky.wtf/now/.

= Itches =
This is a place for me to drop some itches, ideas and thoughts around IndieWeb building blocks that I'd want to build and/or add to my personal site and projects.

* [[Event]] management site dedicated for IndieWeb members
* IndieWeb compatible (or -first!) [[app store]]
* Native libraries to interact with IndieWeb sites
* Simpler detection of what text formats a site can accept for [[Micropub]]

=== Gitea + IndieWeb Support via Webmention ===


I want to see if I hack the following features into Gitea (and maybe use it as a test bed for other kind of version control projects):

==== Opening Issues via Webmention ====

I'd want to be able to open an issue on a project by sending a Webmention to the repository's URI! This will require a new "issue-of" property / type so I can open them up there.

* TODO: Figure out flow and response.

==== Replying Issues via Webmention ====

Submitting a response should be just as easy!

* TODO: Figure out flow and response.
* TODO: Figure out how to handle idempotent messages. 

==== Submit Patches / Changes to a PR ====

Send changes to a PR that an author has permission to update with the provided patches in the sequential order specified.

* TODO: Figure out flow and response.
* TODO: Maybe leverage [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email '''git-send-email'''].

==== Send Webmentions in Linkable Text Regions ====

Final step would be to receive said mentions whenever a URI of the user or the nickname of the user is mentioned:

* Text in a commit message
* In a comment made in 
** Merge request
** Issue text 

=== Syndicator Detection ===
I'd want to have a way to detect and authenticate with a site that provides [[h-x-app]] information to expose what kind of syndication targets it can provide. The MF2 could look something like:

<pre>
<section class="h-x-app h-syndicator">
  <h3 class="p-name"><a href="https://app.com" class="u-uid u-url">App</a></h3>
  <p class="e-content">This service can retrieve syndication requests to the following sources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" class="u-target p-name">Twitter</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" class="u-target p-name">GitHub</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" class="u-target p-name">Mastodon</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" class="u-target p-name">Newsletter</a></li>
  </ul>
</section>
</pre>

The above would expose to a site in question that the app can syndicate to a particular set of destinations. One could then use these values (<code>u-target</code>) in their syndication endpoint. Ideally, the app would know which user it's coming from based on the host name provided or via a [[webmention]] to determine the user in question.

=== Format Detection ===
A request to one's [[Micropub]] endpoint can give information about the kind of formats in which one can set information to for creating new contet.

==== Determining ====
Another option to [https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#querying query from a Micropub client]. The fields that come back under 'formats' would have the keys:

* '''name''': The name to show to the client
* '''uid''': The unique ID that the [[Micropub]] server would recognize.
* '''help''': Link to help information about formatting options.

If we use common UIDs all around then clients can switch to compatible editors with no problem.

<pre>
GET /micropub?q=formats&for[]=entry

{
  "type": ["h-entry"],
  "formats": [
    {
      "name": "GitHub Flavored Markdown",
      "uid": "markdown+ghe",
      "help": "https://github.github.com/gfm/"
    },
    {
      "name": "Gruber's  Markdown",
      "uid": "markdown",
      "help": "https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
    },
    {
      "name": "Liquid",
      "uid": "liquid",
      "help": "https://shopify.github.io/liquid/"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

==== Posting With it ====
Similar to the [https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#create create flow for Micropub].

<pre>
POST /micropub?h=entry&content[type]=markdown-ghe&content[formatted]=<FORMATTED>
