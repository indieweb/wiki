I'm {{JackyAlcine}}. I really enjoy working on software and making it more simple to use for anyone interested. That said, I really like keeping my content on my own terms. You'll see that a lot of sections below might be out of date but will point to parts of my personal site that you can reference for more up to date bits.

At the time of writing, https://jacky.wtf, my personal site is working towards [https://indieweb.org/IndieMark#Level_2 Level 2].
