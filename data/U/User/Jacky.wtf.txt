I'm {{JackyAlcine}}. I really enjoy working on software and making it more simple to use for anyone interested. That said, I really like keeping my content on my own terms. You'll see that a lot of sections below might be out of date but will point to parts of my personal site that you can reference for more up to date bits.

At the time of writing, https://jacky.wtf, my personal site is working towards [https://indieweb.org/IndieMark#Level_2 Level 2].

== Projects ==

There's [[IndieMark Scanner]] and the following in drafts.

=== Koype ===

A rebuild of my personal website as a IndieWeb site. It'll aim to implement the following things:

* [[IndieAuth|self-hosted authentication via IndieAuth]]
* [[Micropub|self-hosted posts management via Micropub]]
* [[Webmentions|self-hosted web mention support via Webmentions]]
* [[Microsub|self-hosted subscription tooling via Microsub]]

=== Terrific ===
A homage to Mr. Terrific from DC comics, this serves as the native mobile application that'll be a testbed for features mentioned above like [[IndieAuth]], [[scrobbling]] and the likes.
