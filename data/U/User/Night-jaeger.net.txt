== Web Background ==

I created [https://night-jaeger.net night-jaeger.net] around 2002, mainly to house Marvel Comics fanfiction as part of the MV-1 fanfiction project. Pages were made using FrontPage Express 2.0, but over time I learned (through exploring website source code) CSS and some minimal JS.

Once social media became a thing in its current form, I began to lose interest in the Internet as all content was being formed within the scope of what the media wanted, rather than genuinely from scratch. I tried moving over to CMS tools including Post-Nuke and Wordpress but nothing stuck.

I became aware of the IndieWeb in 2025 and fell in love with the human first, semantic nature of the IndieWeb and microformats, so decided to bring back my site (and to find old content and restore it as well).

== Philosophy ==

I believe that tools exist to help humans do what they need or want to do. Tools should not dictate how things are done, or what can be done - hence my resistance to engage with social media or the corporate web.

This is strongly reflected in my teaching, as well, favouring individually-crafted lessons rather than reusing previous lessons or pre-packaged content. The shift to explicit-direct instruction and the use of pre-planned, scripted lessons prompted my shift from primary to secondary teaching at the end of 2025.

== Tokusatsu ==

I love tokusatsu - especially Super Sentai - and this is reflected in most of what I do.
