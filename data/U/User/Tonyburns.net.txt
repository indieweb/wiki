== Setup ==

My main website is tonyburns.net, a [https://gohugo.io Hugo]-based static website using [https://docs.github.com/en/actions GitHub Actions]
* iA Writer → [https://micro.blog/craftyphotons Micro.blog] → [https://twitter.com/craftyphotons Twitter]
* iA Writer → tonyburns.net (via manual export from iA Writer to tonyburns.net Git repository) → Micro.blog (summary) → Twitter (summary)

== Itches ==

* Make tonyburns.net a full website and not just a business card
* Automated POSSE of posts on tonyburns.net to Twitter, Micro.blog, Medium, and Dev
* Multimedia gallery for photos, video, and audio
** Deployed as static site to Netlify
** Maybe a web GUI to manage the content that sits on top of a Git repository
* Personal shortlink service
* Personal bookmark service
* Personal pastebin service

== Working On ==

* Hugo theme for tonyburns.net
* Automated publishing and POSSE pipeline for tonyburns.net
* Micropub implementation on top of Hugo
* Ruby on Rails-based shortlink application to be used as [[eat what you cook]] for personal shortlinks
