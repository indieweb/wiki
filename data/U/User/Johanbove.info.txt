== Itches ==
=== Open Productivity ===
* Publish the status of tasks from within [[TaskWarrior]] on my own site to share with the public as part of the "[https://johanbove.info/plans/9-openproductivity.shtml Open productivity]" mind-set.
** See [https://taskwarrior.org/docs/hooks.html TaskWarrior Hooks]
** Example: [https://noeldemartin.com/now Noel De Martin's now page]

=== Personal Web ===
* Get rid of the [[Facebook]] accounts used by me and my family and replace it with our own sites.
* Make sure the content [[feed]] is working nicely

=== Contribute to Known development ===
* Contribute to the [[Known]] open source project and follow up with Marcus Povey.
* Fix [https://github.com/idno/known/issues issues in Known] and report newly found ones.
* Improve the front-end code in [[Known]] - [[Bootstrap]], [[JavaScript]] structure and organization.
* Figure out how to better integrate [[brid.gy]] - having some issues with how notes and likes are posted to [[Twitter]].
* Filter posts by date - see how Jonathan LaCour (CleverDevil) made his [https://github.com/cleverdevil/CleverCustomize CleverCustomize] hacks.
* Write about [[Content-Security-Policy]] and [[Web_sign-in]].

== Working On ==
=== Personal Web ===
* Show [[webmention]] on my personal homepage. - For offering a way to comment and like content on my static [[Apache]] Server-side-Includes ''powered'' homepage ...
* Add an input form for pasting in a comment URL to conveniently send a manual [[webmention]] - see {{aaronpk}}'s implementation for inspiration - To make it easier for people to send me a manual webmention link
* Fix design issues ([[CSS]]) in my [[Known]] site. Currently I have my own theme, but still need to overwrite a lot of "default" style declarations
* Testing [[Indigenous]] on [[iOS]] and [[Android]] - Getting in touch with the developers Eddie Hinkle and Kristof De Jaeger
* Trying out other apps for [[reader]]: [[Monocle]]

=== Promoting the IndieWeb ===
* Getting more people in my circles interested in the IndieWeb
* Keep [https://social.johanbove.info my Known site] running and full of content and links

== More Plans ==
I also keep [https://johanbove.info/plans/ my plans] on my personal plans page.

But here are a few more ideas:

* Attend an [https://indieweb.org/Events IndieWeb Bootcamp event] - some day, some where, either IRL or remote
* Try to motivate the [https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/ Gothenborg Bit Factory] team to blow new live into TaskWarrior, Taskserver and holidata.net as part of the IndieWeb movement (?)

== Done ==
* Complete my IndieWeb Profile with more itches and plans
* Complete the steps in https://indiewebify.me/ on my personal site at https://johanbove.info
* Create an account on IndieWeb.org
* Set up Known as my social platform
* Set up webmention for my personal site through https://webmention.io
* Set up feed channels in [[Aperture]]
* Create a wiki sparkline {{johanbove}}
