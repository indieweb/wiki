== Plans ==

I keep [https://johanbove.info/plans/ my plans on my personal plans page].

But here are a few more ideas:

* Complete my Indieweb Profile with more plans
* Attend an Indieweb Bootcamp
* Try to motivate the Gothenborgbitfactory.org guys to blow new live into TaskWarrior, Taskserver and holidata.net
