== Plans ==

I keep [https://johanbove.info/plans/ my plans on my personal plans page].

But here are a few more ideas:

* Complete my Indieweb Profile with more plans
* Attend an Indieweb Bootcamp - some day, some where.
* Contribute to the [https://github.com/idno/known Known] open source project.
* Try to motivate the [https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/ Gothenborg Bit Factory] team to blow new live into TaskWarrior, Taskserver and holidata.net as part of the IndieWeb movement
