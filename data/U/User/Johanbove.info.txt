== Itches ==
=== Open Productivity ===
* Publish the status of tasks from within TaskWarrior on my own site to share with the public as part of the "[https://johanbove.info/plans/9-openproductivity.shtml Open productivity]" mind-set.

=== Personal Web ===
* Get rid of the Facebook accounts used by me and my family and replace it with our own sites.

=== Contribute to Known development ===
* Contribute to the [https://github.com/idno/known Known] open source project.
* Fix bugs in Known
* Improve the JavaScript organisation in Known
* Figure out how to better integrate https://brid.gy

== Working On ==
=== Personal Web ===
* Show webmentions on my personal homepage.

=== Promoting the IndieWeb ===
* Getting more people in my circles interested in the IndieWeb
* Keep [https://social.johanbove.info my Known site] running and full of content and links

== Plans ==
I also keep [https://johanbove.info/plans/ my plans] on my personal plans page.

But here are a few more ideas:

* Complete my IndieWeb Profile with more itches and plans
* Attend an IndieWeb Bootcamp - some day, some where.
* Try to motivate the [https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/ Gothenborg Bit Factory] team to blow new live into TaskWarrior, Taskserver and holidata.net as part of the IndieWeb movement
