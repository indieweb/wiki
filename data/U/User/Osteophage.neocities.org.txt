== Wiki Editing Notes ==

[[Getting Started]] page: 

* The page title and intro set up expectation of sequential steps for getting started, and then what appears next on the page is not actually formatted or composed in terms of sequential steps. The page content and the page intro should be brought more into line with each other. 
 
* The Videos & Articles section should be reduced to a one-line pair of links to their respective wiki pages or removed entirely.

* Too many subheaders and single-line bullet points are about as detrimental to readability as not having any headers or formatting at all; these need to be pruned down in the Get Your Own Site section.

* Join The Community appearing so early on the page makes it look like it's high in importance, as if this is a necessary step before you can do anything else (especially given the expectations set by the intro). This section should either be relocated to a later part of the page or reduced to a set of links in the intro.

* The IndieWeb Self-Starters section feels like it could use a different header. Regardless, some of this information seems like "get your own site" information (like web hosting) that should go in the previous section, and some of it does not really seem necessary (a person inclined to add links to their social media accounts does not need to be instructed to do that).

* By definition, "optional bonus steps" are not getting started steps. If we have wiki pages on those other steps, then those wiki pages can be linked instead.

* If the tutorials in the Historical section are outdated, then they should be removed or moved to a different page.
