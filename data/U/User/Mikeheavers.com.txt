I'm '''Mike Heavers''', a Senior Design Technologist on the Future Products team at Mozilla. 

I've been designing, strategizing, prototyping and coding for the web for almost 20 years. 

I'm driven to tell compelling stories with data, make disparate technologies talk to one another, and make technology more accessible and useful to non-coders. I'm learning strategies and frameworks for better understanding human behavior and how that relates to creating more relevant & necessary technological experiences, specifically as that relates to the preservation of the natural world.

In my spare time you might find me hacking, building, climbing, riding, running, repairing, and learning - hopefully with other amazing humans.
