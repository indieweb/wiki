Hi, I’m {{nsmsn}}, a designer based in the U.S. You can find me at [https://nicksimson.com nicksimson.com]

I built my website with [[Eleventy]] (previously on [[Jekyll]]). I have been interested in static sites for a while, and I want to add more support for IndieWeb protocols to my personal site. I’ve owned my domain name since 2008.
