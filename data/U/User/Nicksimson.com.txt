Hi, Iâ€™m {{nsmsn}}, a designer based in the U.S. You can find me at [https://nicksimson.com nicksimson.com] where I blog about books, music, the web, and a bunch of other topics. I also use [https://nicks.im nicks.im] for shorter links.

I am currently running my website with [[WordPress]] (previously on [[Eleventy]] and [[Jekyll]] before that). I've had my domain name since 2008.
