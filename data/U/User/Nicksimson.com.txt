Hi, I’m {{nsmsn}}, a designer based in the U.S. You can find me at [https://nicksimson.com nicksimson.com]

I am currently running my website with [[WordPress]] (previously on [[Eleventy]] and [[Jekyll]] before that). My site currently supports microformats and IndieAuth. I want to add more support for IndieWeb stuff to my personal site. I’ve owned my domain name since 2008.
