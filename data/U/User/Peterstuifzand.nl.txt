I wrote a WebSub hub, the allow me to use the websub protocols. My publog website uses microformats and supports Micropub. I can syndicate notes to Twitter and bookmarks to Pinboard. I have posted messages with Omnibear, Micropublish.net and Quill. I also assembled a DIY screenshot tool that uses Micropub to send screenshots to my publog.
