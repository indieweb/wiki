== Indie Web Construction Kit ==

I'm currently using [[Jekyll]] for IndieWeb publishing with [[GitHub]] as the underlying platform at [http://blog.wrk3.com blog.wrk3.com]. I began by using [[Known]], a great platform, but I decided I wanted to wanted to learn more about Indie Web technologies and because I prefer a flat site design rather than one that uses databases. My first attempt used Pelican, but after my move from Southern California I was forced to mothball the server which provided Pelican. I switched to Jekyll because it's native to Github and allows me to simply upload markdown files either through the web interface or using [http://workingcopyapp.com/ Working Copy] from my iPad or iPhone.
