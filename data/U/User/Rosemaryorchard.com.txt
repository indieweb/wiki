Please feel free to borrow/steal/expand on the project and session ideas below!

== Project Ideas ==
* Bridgy support for Reddit
* Support for multi photo posts on WordPress
* Support for collection posts on WordPress
* Video/cartoon intro to Indie Web (2-minute video for YouTube, what is it and why is it important?)
* Make an about page (with a proper h-card)
* Posting to my website and syndicating elsewhere ([[PESOS]], especially syndicating notes to Facebook pages)
* Improving my feeds - want to link all of them in my <head>
* Publishing data from TripIt and publicising it automatically when each event should end
* Recreating Glympse functionality on my own website (generate a random URL, which shares my current location via Compass for a pre-determined time period)
* The "blue Aaron dot"
* Sharing media consumption
** Books
** TV (Trakt and Netflix)
** Don't necessarily want to publicise everything!
* Replying to webmentions

== Session Ideas ==
* POSSE vs PESOS, who is doing what, where, and why?
* Shortcuts (iOS app) interactions with MicroPub
* A comprehensive hcard
