Please feel free to borrow/steal/expand on the project and session ideas below!

== Project Ideas ==
* Bridgy support for Reddit
* Support for multi-photo posts on WordPress - first photo (or only photo) could optionally be marked and understood as featured. https://indieweb.org/featured
* Support for collection posts on WordPress
* Video/cartoon intro to Indie Web (2-minute video for YouTube, what is it and why is it important?)
* Make an about page (with a proper h-card)
* Posting to my website and syndicating elsewhere ([[PESOS]], especially syndicating notes to Facebook pages)
* Improving my feeds - want to link all of them in my <head>
* Publishing data from TripIt and publicising it automatically when each event should end
* Recreating Glympse functionality on my own website (generate a random URL, which shares my current location via Compass for a pre-determined time period)
* The "[[blue dot]]" (https://aaronparecki.com/2017/05/19/18/still-here)
* Sharing media consumption
** Books
** TV (Trakt and Netflix)
** Don't necessarily want to publicise everything!
* Replying to web mentions
* Add maps to my check-ins
* A Reader purely for a read it later channel (related to IndiePaper), consistent formatting, etc. Would allow you to save the contents offline.
* Dark mode for my website
** Support for OS dark/light mode (https://css-tricks.com/dark-modes-with-css/)
* About page: A comprehensive h-card
* Getting an overview of travel formats per week/month/year
* Change my post excerpts for location containing posts to contain a map if there is no picture, and to include the location name data
* Add theming to Indigenous for iOS
* Fix h-card on my website (Prettify in sidebar, add hidden one in the header)
* Improve microformats in my WP Theme
* Add [https://help.micro.blog/2018/tagmoji/ tagmoji] to all micro posts with a format
* Import my Nintendo Switch playing time as posts: https://eddiehinkle.com/2019/03/13/5/code/

* Static site based on WordPress data? (Based on what Charlie, sonniesedge.net, is thinking of from her intro in Berlin 2019)

== Session Ideas ==
* Shortcuts (iOS app) interactions with MicroPub
* A comprehensive hcard
* Location data! 
** Sharing for a specified period of time
** Still here
** Mapstr alternative
** https://sebastiangreger.net/2018/05/self-hosting-maps-control-privacy-ux/
* Replacing Facebook groups, private options! https://micro.blog/zachphillips/3450968

== Previous Sessions ==
* POSSE vs PESOS, who is doing what, where, and why? [[2019/Berlin/syndicall]]

== Issues I want to solve ==
* I would love to be able to have different channels in Aperture (Microsub) post to different categories in WP. As tags which match category names are auto "translated" into categories, this might be as simple as adding "preferred tags" to microsub channels, which are included in the micropub?

== Events Attended ==
* [[2019/Berlin]]
* [[2018/Nuremberg]]
