I started blogging in 2004, and did it off and on under several different domains until about 2021. For a while I still had the domains, but the sites were down. 

Mastodon got me interested in it again, at [swduncan.com](https://swduncan.com). It reminded me that writing and putting stuff on the web can be fun. 

So I'm getting back on the web. First via Wordpress, but I'm getting more interested in a simpler approach with a static site, once I figure out all the moving parts. Currently I'm fiddling with Pelican, and trying to get to a decent workflow using Ulysses. Next will be incorporating ActivityPub and ultimately I'd like to have the same mobile posting capability I had with Wordpress.
