== Hi, I’m Luke ==
I'm a builder, tinkerer, and long-time web person living in Japan.

I care about owning my corner of the web, shipping imperfect things, and learning in public.  
Most of what I do lives somewhere between "useful" and "probably a bad idea, but interesting".

I'm here because:
* platforms decay
* feeds disappear
* and personal websites are still the most honest interface we have

== What I'm into ==
* Personal websites as living systems, not portfolios
* IndieWeb principles (own your data, publish first, syndicate second)
* WordPress (deeply), CSS frameworks, animation (GSAP), tooling
* Experiments that may or may not survive first contact with reality
* Writing that doesn't try to sell anything

== My corner of the web ==
* '''Website''': https://ekul.me
* '''Monster Energy Tracker''': https://ekul.me/monster
* '''Code''': https://github.com/Ulprus

== Projects ==
* Core Framework — CSS framework for WordPress builders
* Motion.page — animation tooling powered by GSAP
* Client and personal sites focused on clarity and performance
* Internal tools that probably won't launch

== Experiments & failures ==
* Products I over-engineered instead of shipping
* Automation ideas that sounded brilliant at 2am
* Social posting experiments that proved owning the source matters
* "Quick features" that turned into rewrites

Failure is documentation.

== Tools & stack ==
* React / TypeScript
* Convex (literally in love with it)
* WordPress Custom Dev
* Bricks Builder / Oxygen Builder
* PHP, JS, CSS
* VPS + Cloudflare
* GitHub

== Why IndieWeb ==
Because I don't want my writing trapped inside someone else's business model.

Because a personal website can be a logbook, a lab, and a place to think slowly.

== Now ==
Currently refining my site as a long-term knowledge base, experimenting with publishing workflows, and trying to ship smaller things more often.

This page will probably change without notice.
