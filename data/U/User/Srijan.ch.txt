== ToDo / Itches ==

* Notes filtering by kind in /notes
* Prev/Next navigation links
* h-cite in interactions (like/reply)?
* Staging/Test site to test new features?
* Site search functionality
* Lightbox and simple gallery for images in a post
* Explicit cover image selection for articles instead of taking the first image
** Also display cover image in this case at the top of the article
* Add GPG key based indieauth login
* Should I enable moderation for webmentions and fediverse replies?
* Use an image proxy for gravatar and fediverse images?
* Update to Kirby 4 (rc1 is out as of 2023-11-11) - some plugins not compatible yet
* Figure out about indieauth.com vs indielogin.com. Do I need to switch to indielogin?
* Self indieauth instead of 3rd party? (https://github.com/sebastiangreger/kirby3-selfauth)

== Implementation Design ==

Using https://getkirby.com/ with some indieweb plugins:
* https://github.com/mauricerenck/indieConnector
* https://github.com/mauricerenck/komments
* https://github.com/sebastiangreger/kirby3-micropublisher

=== IndieWeb Features ===

* Indieauth
* Receive webmentions (via webmention.io)
* Send webmentions
* Display webmentions on posts
* Integrate with fed.brid.gy to act as a fediverse instance @srijan.ch@srijan.ch
* h-card on home, h-entry on posts, and h-feeds
* Microsub via aperture
* Micropub

=== URL Design ===

* Top level pages:
** / - Has an h-card, and recent list of articles + non-reaction notes
** /about - About page
** /notes - Lists all notes
** /blog
** /feed
* Note slugs are of the format: Y-m-d-<counter>, e.g: 2023-11-09-001
** Full notes URL: /notes/2023-11-09-001
* Blog posts (articles) have a keyword-based slug
** Full URL for blog posts don't have the /blog prefix.
* Tag pages are on /tags/<tagname> and list notes+articles filtered by the tag

=== Feeds ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! h-feed !! RSS feed !! Description
|-
| /feed/all || /feed/all.xml || All notes+articles
|-
| /feed/notes || /feed/notes.xml || All notes
|-
| /feed/blog || /feed/blog.xml || All blog articles
|}

== Notes ==

* Looks like indiewebify.me and the parser at https://waterpigs.co.uk/php-mf2/ do not detect an h-card's u-photo if additional classes are added to the image. To fix this, I had to add manual styling in a style attribute instead of using tailwind classes.
