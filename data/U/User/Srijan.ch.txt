== ToDo ==

* Migrate blog posts from old domain to new
* The main h-card on my homepage did not work as expected. I've put a workaround for now, but need to debug further.
* Figure out about indieauth.com vs indielogin.com. Do I need to switch to indielogin?
* Should I enable moderation for webmentions and fediverse replies?
* Use an image proxy for gravatar and fediverse images?

== Implementation Design ==

Using https://getkirby.com/ with some indieweb plugins:
* https://github.com/mauricerenck/indieConnector
* https://github.com/mauricerenck/komments

=== IndieWeb Features ===

* Indieauth
* Receive webmentions (via webmention.io)
* Send webmentions
* Display webmentions on posts
* Integrate with fed.brid.gy to act as a fediverse instance @srijan.ch@srijan.ch

=== URL Design ===

* Top level pages:
** /
** /about
** /notes
** /blog
** /feed
* Note slugs are of the format: Y-m-d-<counter>, e.g: 2023-11-09-001
** Full notes URL: /notes/2023-11-09-001
* Blog posts (articles) have a keyword-based slug
** Full URL for blog posts don't have the /blog prefix.
* Tag pages are on /tags/<tagname> and list notes+articles filtered by the tag

=== Feeds ===
