== Server Environment ==

Gregsplace.net is hosted on a 4 GB Dedicated instance in a Linode data center located in Frankfurt, Germany and has the following specifications:

* 2 CPUs
* 4 GB RAM
* 80 GB Storage
* Dual-stack IPv4 & IPv6

The server uses the following software components to provide its current functionality:

* Ubuntu 22.04.2
* Apache 2.4.5.7
* MariaDB 10.8.8
* PHP 8.2.1.6
* Wordpress 6.2.2

== Working On ==

This is a list of items that currently have priority when it comes to my website's design & functionality:

* Complete the [https://gregsplace.net/welcome Welcome] and  [https://gregsplace.net/about-me About Me] pages for the website
* Continue testing out both the [https://indieweb.org/Together Together] and [https://indieweb.org/IndiePass IndiePass] clients for desktop and mobile use respectively

== Itches ==

The following items are things that I'd like to have done on my website, but aren't at the top of my priority list at the moment:

* Figure out a list of categories to sort content into
* Come up with a coherent and non-complicated privacy policy plus create a page on the website for it
