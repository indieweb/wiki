I've had a personal website since my college days, later moving from the student web space to [https://hyperborea.org Hyperborea.org]. I've never stopped blogging there, so in a sense my site's been IndieWeb in spirit forever, but I finally got around to setting up an actual IndieWeb identity at [https://kvibber.com KVibber.com].

== So Far ==
* Adapted one of my blogs, [https://hyperborea.org/les-mis/ Re-Reading Les Mis], to include the requisite metadata. It's built in [[Eleventy]], and it was surprisingly easy to add the tags to my templates.
* Set up my main, self-hosted [[WordPress]] blog, [https://hyperborea.org/journal/ K-Squared Ramblings] (which I've been POSSEing to various extents since before I knew there was a term for it), to use the IndieWeb plugin and theme support, though I need to get back to improving some of the metadata.
* Decided not to implement WebMentions anywhere except maaaaaaybe the blog, because I get so few comments as it is that it wouldn't be worth the spam maintenance.

== To Do ==
* Inspired by the [[garden and stream]] metaphor, move blog posts that would be better in collections than in a chronological stream. I'm building a mini-site of troubleshooting posts with Eleventy, to hash out additional features that I didn't need on the Les Mis blog.
* Decide how to handle feedback on those pages.
* Clean up the 11ty templates once they're functionally complete and publish them as a git repository.
* Add metadata to other pages where relevant.
* Set up a photo gallery combining my publicly-shared photos at Instagram, Pixelfed, Mastodon, Twitter etc. PESOS to start with.

== Someday ==

* Set up a notes archive.
* Add my Filckr archives to the gallery. It's, um, gonna be big. And it'll probably require external storage.

== Silo Status ==
* Currently active: Flickr, plus Mastodon and Pixelfed (if you can call them silos)
* Occasionally: Twitter (also I syndicate my blog and Pixelfed to it)
* Inactive: Instagram (2019), Facebook (2018), Tumblr (2019). I've also drastically pared down my Instagram and Tumblr posts.
