I've had a personal website since my college days, later moving from the student web space to [https://hyperborea.org Hyperborea.org]. I've never stopped blogging there, so in a sense my site's been IndieWeb in spirit forever, but I finally got around to setting up an actual IndieWeb identity at [https://kvibber.com KVibber.com].

== So Far ==
* I've adapted one of my blogs, [https://hyperborea.org/les-mis/ Re-Reading Les Mis], to include the requisite metadata. It's built in 11ty, and it was surprisingly easy to add the tags to my templates.
* I've also set up my main, WordPress-powered blog, [https://hyperborea.org/journal/ K-Squared Ramblings], to use the IndieWeb plugin and theme support, though I need to get back to improving some of the metadata.

== To Do ==
* Decide how much I want to use things like webmentions.
* Add metadata to other pages on my site where relevant.
* Set up a combined gallery of my publicly-shared photos at Instagram, Pixelfed, Mastodon, Twitter etc. Start as PESOS, eventually move to POSSE.

== Someday ==

* Decide how to handle notes and such. I don't want to clutter the blog.
* Mirror my Flickr account on my own site. It's, um, gonna be big.

== Silo Status ==
* Currently active: Mastodon, Flickr and Pixelfed
* Occasionally: Twitter (plus I syndicate blog & Pixelfed to it)
* Inactive: Instagram (2019), Facebook (2018), Tumblr (2019). I've also drastically pared down my Instagram and Tumblr posts.
