I've had a personal website since my college days, later moving from the student web space to [https://hyperborea.org Hyperborea.org]. I've never stopped blogging there, so in a sense my site's been IndieWeb in spirit forever, but I finally got around to setting up an actual IndieWeb identity at [https://kvibber.com KVibber.com].

== So Far ==
* Adapted one of my blogs, [https://hyperborea.org/les-mis/ Re-Reading Les Mis], to include the requisite metadata. It's built in [[Eleventy]], and it was surprisingly easy to add the tags to my templates.
* Set up my main, self-hosted [[WordPress]] (now [[ClassicPress]]) blog, [https://hyperborea.org/journal/ K-Squared Ramblings] (which I've been POSSEing to various extents since before I knew there was a term for it), to use the IndieWeb plugin and theme support, though I need to get back to improving some of the metadata.
* Inspired by the [[garden and stream]] metaphor, I've been building collections of troubleshooting posts and [[review]]s, consolidating not just my blog entries but app store reviews, stackexchange answers, etc. I'm building both minisites with [[microformats]] and ATOM feeds, and using [[IFTTT]] to automatically POSSE new articles to Mastodon and Tumblr.
* Released an early version of [https://codeberg.org/kvibber/indies-eleven Indie's Eleven], a super-light (but responsive!) starting template for Eleventy that includes Microformats2 along with other metadata types, based on what I learned building new sections of my site and rebuilding existing ones. I've re-based both the tech and review minisites on this code.
* Written a tool to [https://hyperborea.org/tech-tips/combine-feeds/ combine all the feeds] into one, and add ''all'' the new posts from every section on my home page(s).
* Moved my main Fediverse profile to a self-hosted [[GoToSocial]] instance.

== To Do ==
* Refine that 11ty template!
* Update my website's old hand-coded photo gallery so I can make it responsive, interconnected, and expandable.
* Import more silo archives (selectively!) to my website/blog.
* Decide how to handle feedback on static pages. Webmentions seem to be a lot of overhead considering how few comments I get.
* Integrate the tag archives for the site's various subsections.

== Someday ==
* Host my own copies of my FOSS projects. Maybe a Gitea instance, maybe just static pages with zips of the source.
* Self-hosted photo gallery, including Flickr and the good photos from Instagram/Pixelfed (most of which are also on Flickr anyway).
* Sort out what I want to move to kvibber.com and what I want to keep at hyperborea.org.

== Tabled/Abandoned ==

* Self-hosted gallery of publicly-shared photos from "social" platforms like Instagram, Pixelfed, Twitter, etc.

Why? I've gone back and forth between wanting to preserve ALL THE THINGS! and letting the ephemeral be ephemeral, and I've finally come down on the side of preserving what I think is ''worth'' preserving, and letting the rest, if not expire, at least be expendable.

Instead, I'm going to step up what I've been doing occasionally anyway: Take the more interesting posts from silos and either cross-post or expand them on my website. Sort of a curated PESOS strategy.

As for photos, the "good" photos are already getting cross-posted to Flickr, so the "interesting" ones can go to my blog (where they would have been in the pre-Twitter days anyway!).

== Silo Status ==
* Currently active: Flickr. Also Mastodon, Pixelfed and [[BookWyrm]] (if you can call them silos). Occasionally checking in on [[Bluesky]].
* Inactive: Tumblr (2019), Twitter main (2023). I've stopped posting to these and deleted most of my archives. I'm still in the process of importing some of the still-interesting posts to my website.
* Deleted: Twitter alts (2020/2023), Reddit (2023), Instagram (2020/2024), Facebook (2018/2024)
