I've had a personal website since my college days, later moving from the student web space to [https://hyperborea.org Hyperborea.org]. I've never stopped blogging there, so in a sense my site's been IndieWeb in spirit forever, but I finally got around to setting up an actual IndieWeb identity at [https://kvibber.com KVibber.com].

== So Far ==
* Adapted one of my blogs, [https://hyperborea.org/les-mis/ Re-Reading Les Mis], to include the requisite metadata. It's built in [[Eleventy]], and it was surprisingly easy to add the tags to my templates.
* Set up my main, self-hosted [[WordPress]] blog, [https://hyperborea.org/journal/ K-Squared Ramblings] (which I've been POSSEing to various extents since before I knew there was a term for it), to use the IndieWeb plugin and theme support, though I need to get back to improving some of the metadata.
* Inspired by the [[garden and stream]] metaphor, I've been building collections of troubleshooting posts and reviews, consolidating not just my blog entries but app store reviews, stackexchange answers, etc. I'm building both minisites with ATOM feeds, and  using [[IFTTT]] to automatically POSSE new reviews to Twitter, Mastodon and Tumblr.
* Released an early version of [https://codeberg.org/kvibber/indies-eleven Indie's Eleven], a super-light (but responsive!) starting template for Eleventy that includes Microfotmats2 along with other metadata types, based on what I learned building new sections of my site and rebuilding existing ones.

== To Do ==
* Refine that 11ty template!
* Host my own copies of my FOSS projects. Maybe a Gitea instance, maybe just static pages with zips of the source.
* Decide how to handle feedback on static pages. (Webmentions seem to be a lot of overhead considering how few comments I get.)
* Set up a photo gallery combining my publicly-shared photos at Instagram, [[Pixelfed]], [[Mastodon]], Twitter etc. PESOS to start with.

== Someday ==

* Set up a notes archive. Maybe Known, maybe a super-light WordPress theme, maybe something else. Or maybe just import pieces I think are worth keeping to the blog.
* Add my Flickr archives to the gallery. It's, um, gonna be big. And it'll probably require external storage.
* Sort out what I want to move to kvibber.com and what I want to keep at hyperborea.org.

== Silo Status ==
* Currently active: Flickr, plus Mastodon, Pixelfed and [[Bookwyrm]] (if you can call them silos)
* Occasionally: Twitter (also I syndicate my blog, reviews and Pixelfed to it)
* Inactive: Instagram (2019), Facebook (2018), Tumblr (2019). I've also drastically cleaned out a lot of my old Instagram and Tumblr posts.
