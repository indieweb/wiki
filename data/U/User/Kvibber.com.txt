I've had a personal website since my college days, later moving from the student web space to [https://hyperborea.org Hyperborea.org]. I've never stopped blogging there, so in a sense my site's been IndieWeb in spirit forever, but I finally got around to setting up an actual IndieWeb identity at [https://kvibber.com KVibber.com].

So Far:
* I've adapted one of my blogs, [https://hyperborea.org/les-mis/ Re-Reading Les Mis], to include the requisite metadata. It's built in 11ty, and it was surprisingly easy to add the tags to my templates.
* I've also set up my main, WordPress-powered blog, [https://hyperborea.org/journal/ K-Squared Ramblings], to use the IndieWeb plugin and theme support, though I need to get back to refining some of the metadata. (I want to keep both the author archives and the link to my IndieWeb profile, and I haven't decided the best way to do that.)


To Do:
* Figure out to what extent I want to use things like webmentions.
* Set up a combined gallery of my publicly-shared photos at Instagram, Pixelfed, Mastodon, Twitter etc. Initially I'd like to build the archive and PESOS the new ones back, but eventually I want to start there and selectively POSSE the photos out.
