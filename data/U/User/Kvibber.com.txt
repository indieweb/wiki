I've had a personal website since my college days, later moving from the student web space to [https://hyperborea.org Hyperborea.org]. I've never stopped blogging there, so in a sense my site's been IndieWeb in spirit forever, but I finally got around to setting up an actual IndieWeb identity at [https://kvibber.com KVibber.com].

== So Far ==
* Adapted one of my blogs, [https://hyperborea.org/les-mis/ Re-Reading Les Mis], to include the requisite metadata. It's built in [[Eleventy]], and it was surprisingly easy to add the tags to my templates.
* Set up my main, self-hosted [[WordPress]] blog, [https://hyperborea.org/journal/ K-Squared Ramblings] (which I've been POSSEing to various extents since before I knew there was a term for it), to use the IndieWeb plugin and theme support, though I need to get back to improving some of the metadata.
* Decided not to implement WebMentions anywhere except maaaaaaybe the blog, because I get so few comments as it is that it wouldn't be worth the spam maintenance.
* Inspired by the [[garden and stream]] metaphor, I've been building collections of troubleshooting posts and reviews, consolidating not just my blog entries but app store reviews, stackexchange answers, etc., as well as rebuilding some of my existing pages to implement more use cases in my metadata-friendly 11ty layout.

== To Do ==

* Decide how to handle feedback on static pages.
* Clean up the 11ty templates once I've tackled enough use cases to they're functionally complete and publish them as a git repository.
* Set up a photo gallery combining my publicly-shared photos at Instagram, Pixelfed, Mastodon, Twitter etc. PESOS to start with.

== Someday ==

* Set up a notes archive.
* Add my Flickr archives to the gallery. It's, um, gonna be big. And it'll probably require external storage.
* Sort out what I want to move to kvibber.com and what I want to keep at hyperborea.org.

== Silo Status ==
* Currently active: Flickr, plus Mastodon and Pixelfed (if you can call them silos)
* Occasionally: Twitter (also I syndicate my blog and Pixelfed to it)
* Inactive: Instagram (2019), Facebook (2018), Tumblr (2019). I've also drastically pared down my Instagram and Tumblr posts.
