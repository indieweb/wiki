Hi! I am {{Evan Boehs}} & I'm writing stuff @ [https://boehs.org boehs.org]

My website is built with the [[11ty]] [[static site generator]], and is hosted at [[netlify]]

My spark is <code><nowiki>{{Evan Boehs}}</nowiki></code>

== Involvement in the indieweb movement + [[itches]] ==

My website is marked up using [[microformats2]], and it is automatically generating [[Atom]] feeds. I am growing a [[digital garden]], and am obviously inherently indiewebby due to my resistance to the [[corporate web]]. I plan to begin using more indieweb protocols soon, including [[webmention]] and [[micropub]].

On the wiki, I have created and made substantial edits to the following pages

* [[CSS Naked Day]]

Off wiki, I am committed to empowering people to write.

* I am developing a command line tool to help people get into web development the correct way, providing gentle scaffolding, a devserver, and help with git.
* I am developing tools to selfhost indieweb endpoints ([[User:Boehs.org/symetre]])
* I am interested in founding a coop that designs websites for people interested in beginning to blog on their own domain (if you are too, please reach out)
