}}

Iâ€™m an artist and designer, making things for web and print. I use paper, card, paint, pixels, HTML, CSS and music. I talk about and make art, [[comics]], websites, [[zine]]s, photography, music, books, stationery, TTRPG stuff and sometimes cups of tea.

I love working both digitally and with pen and paper, the most satisfying part of my work is being able to combine analogue and digital in interesting ways to create something a bit unique.

I've been blogging in some form since the early 2000's, back in the days of [[LiveJournal]], now I use [[Wordpress]] and am busy rediscovering my love of blogging.

I have made websites for artists, educators, and researchers, been part of many self published anthologies and am generally enthusiastic about communicating important ideas through words and pictures.
