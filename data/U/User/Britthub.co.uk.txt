}}

Iâ€™m an artist and designer, making things for web and print. I use paper, card, paint, pixels, HTML, CSS and music. I talk about and make art, [[comics]], websites, [[zine]]s, photography, music, books, stationery, TTRPG stuff and sometimes cups of tea.

I love working both digitally and with pen and paper, the most satisfying part of my work is being able to combine analogue and digital in interesting ways to create something a bit unique.

I've been blogging in some form since the early 2000's, back in the days of [[LiveJournal]], moving to [[Blogger]], I currently use [[WordPress]] and am busy rediscovering my love of blogging.

I have made websites for artists, educators, and researchers, been part of many self published anthologies and am generally enthusiastic about communicating important ideas through words and pictures.

Rediscovering a love for the web. Kind of feels like returning home. Remembering that I'm allowed to play with my website and even sometimes break things, it's not essential infrastructure.

Thinking about ways to connect small web shops for discoverability and reviews. Perhaps an indieweb makers market.
