''Currently in the process of rebuilding / restoring my website on a new compute instance after several upstream incidents over the past few months.
''
== Itches ==
* Streamline bare metal recovery for rebuilding VPS.
* IndieAuth authorization server.
* Webmentions automation.
* "De-monolithing" my custom CMS and factoring out services / features into individual micro services.
* Custom Lightweight ActivityPub server on own domain, integrated into CMS.
* Local search.

== Works in Progress ==
* 100 Days Project (Haiku)
* Curating aggregating related micro posts into long form posts and new narratives.
* Cleaning up CSS stylesheets and standardizing usage and naming conventions across sections, i.e., posts, micro posts, etc.
* Refining IndieAuth server prototype. Fortunately, it worked good enough to allow me to log in and edit my user page here ü§™Ô∏è
* ActivityPub server prototype does Likes. That's enough for now.

== Completed Projects ==
This might actually be a pipe dream.
