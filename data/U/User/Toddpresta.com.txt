* Investigate [[webmention]] capabilities, and possibly adding authorization / token endpoints.
* Incorporate [[microformats]] sitewide.
* Investigate tools and/or options to root out and vanquish legacy, unused CSS cruft caused by cowboy coding :)
* Add capabilities to homegrown CMS to render only updated content instead of rebuilding entire sections that utilize paged navigation.
* Enable nested content (micro posts) inside of longer form posts.
* Create alternative view options (grid based) for now current vertical format galleries.
* Explore sitewide dark mode toggle capability.
