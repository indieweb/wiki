=== Website Itches ===
* Explore sitewide dark mode toggle capability.

=== Working On ===
* Merging inbound [[webmention]]s with custom [[CMS]] posts and rendering on-the-fly.
* Search integration (still experimental).
* Refining [[microformats]] &mdash; still a bit confused on these.

=== Would Like To ===
* Proxy inbound [[webmention]] requests to external endpoint when sent from on-page HTML form.

=== Completed ===
* Enabled nested content (micro posts) inside longer form posts.
* Outbound [[webmention]] capabilities in custom [[CMS]].

=== Perpetual ===
* Eradicating CSS cruft caused by constant experimentation and shameless cowboy coding.

=== Stalled ===
* Custom inbound [[webmention]]s. Using (https://webmention.io) instead &mdash; the web hook feature is awesome!
