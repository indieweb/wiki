您好, my name is '''William Hale''', however, most people know me as '''Salt'''. I am a Seattle local who owns a web development firm and an event bartending service, graduated from the University of Washington, and lead the Greater Seattle Linux Users Group from 2007 through 2015.

My focus is on free/libre/open software and culture, information security, and entrepreneurship. Other hobbies include: urban hiking (walking), dancing (east coast swing, folk, blues, tango), windsports (windsurfing, kiteboarding, sailing), boffering, cooking, driving, gaming, programming, public speaking, reading, robotics, skiing, and travel.

While there are numerous ways to contact me, I prefer synchronous communication and thusly like to hold conversations on IRC or in-person. For IRC, the network I check most frequently is FreeNode. In person, I am very approachable and will always be found wearing a kilt.
