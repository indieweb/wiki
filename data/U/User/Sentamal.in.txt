== Introduction ==

Good day, all y'all, I'm {{Don Geronimo}}. Flight attendant. Furry. General geek with many hats. I've been intending to have my own site and domain for a long while by virtue of I got tired of having to broadcast myself in various places.

When I first started getting on social networks, one of my first experiments (due to me being lazy) is "How can I share something once and have it share to other places automatically?" At first I went with the tools provided by each network, then followed by using IFTTT to do the sharing for me. Other tools and things were eventually added in piecemeal until, well, those started to break and I got too lazy to maintain things that I can't trust to continue working. Eventually, my "participation" (or consumption) of social media essentially stopped, save for conversations with friends.

Truth be told, I don't utilize my silos that often (which is why I've opted to not list them on this page), and even now I've kept my social media accounts just to claim my username, occasionally see what some friends are up to, or have a way to message people that only communicate on a social network. As such, it's been an easy move for me thus far to get my own site up and running and syndicating my content to networks my friends are on whenever I want/need to!

== My Tools ==

I'm a minimalist at heart (or, perhaps, by circumstance/profession) so the things I carry with me to create, update, and maintain my site are few:

=== All Platforms ===
* Hugo
* Git
* Vim
* Keybase

=== Linux (Fedora) ===
* Visual Studio Code

=== Android ===
* Termux

=== Javascript and Web Services ===
* Leaflet
* Mapbox
* Brid.gy
* Webmention.io
* Aperture
* Telegraph
* IndieAuth.com

== Itches ==

* Add "Previous Post" and "Next Post" links to each single page post on my site.
* Sort out Nested Webmentions for my pages' comments.
* Add a mentions count for each entry in my site's feeds.
* Pagination: The home page feed is growing large; should I paginate? I've already finished the pagination on a local topic branch; it's just a matter of merging to enable it. However, this will currently break some u-syndication links present on the canonical post URL that describes the places on my site where it's been syndicated.
* Automation: Every step done on my site right now is essentially manual via command line. I need to add some automation—if only to save me the costs of time for sharing content. I could probably cron some of my tasks on my home computer, for example.
* Posting on Mobile: Right now that's done by Termux in exactly the same process I do at home on Linux. It's good in that I post the same way no matter what device I'm using. It's not so good in that the time cost for posting that way is significantly higher than posting at home.

=== Flight Logs ===

[https://my.flightradar24.com/sentamalin MyFlightradar24] is the only silo—if it can be counted as one—that I'm still dependent on. Considering the (self-professing) data-driven nature of my site at its heart it should be easy for me to implement this on my site and step out of that service. My brainstormed actionable steps at the moment include:

* Create an Archetype in Hugo for Flights, ergo creating a new Section (Type on my site)
 <nowiki>---
title: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}" # Create title from file name
date: {{ .Date }} # Probably should use the flight's departure here
draft: true
airline: # Enum taking either ATA, ICAO, Callsign, or Full Airline Name
flight_number: # Flight number without the Airline Code
departure_airport: # Enum taking either ATA or ICAO of airport
departure_datetime: # Datetime should be local to the airport
arrival_airport: # Enum taking either ATA or ICAO of airport
arrival_datetime: # Datetime should be local to the airport
flight_duration: # Number of seconds?
aircraft_type: # Enum of ICAO Code (A20N), IATA Type Code (32N) or Aircraft Name (A320neo)
aircraft_registration: # Like N720FR
flight_class: # Enum of First, Business, EconPlus, Economy, or Private
flight_seat_type: # Enum of Window, Middle, or Aisle
flight_seat_number: # Like 13F
flight_reason: # Enum of Leisure, Business, Crew, or Other
tags: # Like other Types, flights can be tagged to be put in various tag taxonomies
  - furry
  - eurofurence
  - firstclass
  - inflightmeals
syndicated_links: # Like other types, this can be POSSE'd
  - https://twitter.com/sentamalin/3987500323804 # This is a fake link
  - https://social.librem.one/@sentamalin/87508082323 # Another fake link

Personal notes, summaries, or anything else to describe this flight goes here. Hugo allows this section to be formatted _in Markdown_!</nowiki>
* Create new data for all enums in Archetype
** This is to further separate data from the Archetype front matter.
** This also allows other information in the future to be added without having to re-edit single flights
* Create its single page template, using the data from content (inherited from Flights archetype) and relevant data
** Use Mapbox to grab a static image of the flight plan as a fallback/preview
** Use Leaflet to show an interactive map with the specific flight plan visible
** Decide on using [[h-entry]] or [[h-event]] as a method to describe the flight, or both
* Deviate from my normal list template to create a custom list template for flights
** Use Mapbox to grab a static image of all flights taken as a fallback/preview
** Use Leaflet to show an interactive map with all flights visible
** Underneath this show the list of flights

It's not necessary for me or my job, but it would be also nice if I do some research and add a raw format of flight logs as associated in Pilot Logs and a method of accepting digital signatures. I'm 95% sure that software requires some compliance certification/verification, but an ability for pilots to Own Their Logbooks would be nice because the best option is, alack, paper for that purpose.
