Hello, my website is a personal wiki where I write down and improve upon my thoughts and projects. I produce it by using [[TiddlyWiki]] to create and link pages together and generate a [[static site]].

I try to/want to use the main pages of the website as "canonical pages," pages that I refine over time with more definitive statements about their respective topics. In short: they change and improve (hopefully).

There are other pages on the site that I call "[https://tacticaltypos.net/Journal.html Journal entries]", which do not change much once they've been published. These are pretty much blog posts: I write whatever I'm thinking about regarding a specific topic at a specific time and link the post to the canonical page for the topic it's about. Each canonical page also includes links to all the Journal entries that have been posted about it.

Everything is nicely linked together.
