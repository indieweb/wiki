I run my own site on a Raspberry Pi at [[http://www.donaldmcintosh.net|www.donaldmcintosh.net]] Running my own website is something I enjoy and gives my an internet presence without depending on social media silos.

There is much I still want to add to my website including webmentions and RSVP.  I decided to write my own software to run the site so I need to build everything.  Which is good... but slow.

I can upload photos and do PESOS posts, which is pretty cool.
