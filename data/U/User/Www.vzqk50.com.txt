Hi, I'm Apis Necros, and I run my blog at <a href="https://vzqk50.com" rel="me">vzqk50.com</a>. Here I write about whatever comes to mind, mostly cyber security stuff and philosophical stuff. I also post prototypes of JavaScript projects here.

I care very heavily about the success of the IndieWeb. Having seen and noticed most of the internet die around us, I'm relieved to have a found a community focused on building it back up again.
