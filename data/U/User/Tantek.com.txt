== my indie web setup ==
* http://tantek.com is my primary home where I post:
** [[notes]] and auto-[[POSSE]] them (auto-abbreviated if necessary) to:
*** [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/t which then automatically cross-posts to:
**** [[Facebook]] - default private to me, I optionally manually change to friends-only
** [[articles]] and auto-POSSE their name/title and permalink to:
*** [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/t which then auto-cross-posts to:
**** [[Facebook]]
** [[replies]]+[[RSVP]]s and auto-POSSE them (abbreviated if necessary) to:
*** [[Twitter]] - with destination threading to help the Twitter user's experience.
*** [[Facebook]] RSVPs via [[Bridgy]] Publish
** [[like]]s, then POSSEd per silo target, e.g. automatically to [[Twitter]] via Bridgy Publish, but manually to Facebook, Instagram, other silos.
** [[jam]]s
** [[photo]]s & [[video]]s manually [[PESOS]]ed from [[Foursquare]] (posted via [[Swarm]]) and then auto-POSSEd to [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Twitter]] with Bridgy, and manual POSSE to Instagram

All auto-POSSEing also automatically adds syndication links to my posts. For manual POSSE copies, I have to edit my posts to add syndication links.

=== silo posting ===
In general I treat [[silos]] as building blocks for my own indie web architecture. They're just another [LEGO] brick in the wall as it were.

However there are some content types that I still post to silos, and am using a [[PESETAS]] architecture with two destinations as a stopgap / copying mechanism.
* [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/t_silos - secondary [[PESETAS]] destination
** [[Shazam]] - occasional "saving" of songs I'm hearing / listening to
* [[Last.fm]] - still connected on my laptop and [[Scrobbling]]
* [[Movescount]] - auto-syncs [[running]]/[[yoga]]/[[bicyling]] data from my [[Suunto]] watch, and then auto-cross-posts it to [[Strava]] 

My hope is that by aggregating my silo posting into just two destinations like that, especially Tumblr with a [[microformats2]] supporting theme, that as I add support for content types like [[photos]], [[video]], metrics, jams to my own site, it will be easier to port over past content to my site for historical reference.

Silos I'm using without a copy destination (in alphabetical order):
* [[Foursquare]] - I treat my Foursquare [[checkins]] as semi-private to friends on that silo, and thus I don't have a public PESETAS setup for it. I'm hoping to skip the PESETAS/PESOS step with checkins and implement native checkins directly on my site, and POSSE them out to Foursquare (as Ben Werdmuller does with [[idno]]).
* [[GitHub]] - I use GitHub for both some of my own open source projects, and to contribute to others. I have a redirect url of http://tantek.com/github setup for now just so I can use URLs with a domain I control. This solution has restrictions/limitations, yet is still a stepping stone:
** I am dependent on github's URL design for now - whatever they put after /tantek, I have to support after /github on my site.
** I can delay design of my own non-vendor/silo-specific path (e.g. /source instead of /github) until the point in time when I feel like doing so.
** I should eventually host my own source/issues/gists etc for all the usual reasons [[why]]
** At that point, I can figure out the [[URL design]] of a generic source path (e.g. /source instead of /github), and implement the redirects from /github to /source (or whatever).
* [[PBWorks]] - I have a wiki (AKA PBWiki) hosted there via redirect URL of http://tantek.com/w/ - and again, hope to skip the PESETAS/PESOS step and directly switch to [[wiki]] pages on my own site.

Past silos, which I either no longer post to, or have not really bothered with in a while:
* [[Tumblr]] - http://tantek.tumblr.com - primary [[PESETAS]] destination, has a [[feed]], and I've customized it with [[microformats2]] [[h-entry]] and [[rel-author]] support. As of [http://tantek.com/2013/183/t2/pesetasing-tumblr-stopgap-ownyourdata 2013-182 I'm PESETASing] from:
** ... no silo regularly
* [[Nike+]] - (nearly) daily fitness activity/metrics, e.g. walking/running. Stopped using in 2016-12 when their iOS app would repeatedly just crash on launch. Caused me to switch to [[Strava]] which I've been using instead as of 2017-01.


__TOC__

== my indie web projects ==
Stuff I've written to advance the Indie Web (and runs live on tantek.com) some of which you may be able to re-use hopefully for your own IndieWeb site!
* [[CASSIS]] - http://cassisproject.com/ ([http://twitter.com/cassisjs @cassisjs]) open source Javascript/PHP hybrid framework that runs natively in both. Where I write and keep common functionality for everything else.
* [[Falcon]] - http://tantek.com/w/Falcon ([http://twitter.com/falcon @falcon]) personal site publishing
* [[Whistle]] - http://tantek.com/w/Whistle - personal URL shortener

== need help with ==
Things I'm either stuck on, have been unable to make progress on, or appear to be taking me too long to get to that I'd welcome help with.
* '''everything [[#indieweb_community]]''' - if you see something in the "indieweb community" list below you think you could help with, go ahead and let me know on [[IRC]] (<kbd>!tell tantek ...</kbd>) that you're working on it and go for it - no need to ask, just give me a heads-up and start (maybe add it to your own User page too per [[wikifying]]). Thanks!

== itches ==
These are roughly ordered itches, which may/often translate into specific working on items, but may also be large/challenging enough to generate a number of building block working on items.
# Taking [[photos]] with time/[[location]] information (optional manual location) captured/created offline, optional later posting to own site syndicating elsewhere (COOLPOSSE)
## Adding notes to such photos, at the time of taking, or later, both offline.
# Taking [[notes]] with time/location information (optional manual location) same COOLPOSSE.
# Tracking [[running]] with a series of times/locations (optional manual location) same COOLPOSSE
# Tracking [[venue]] arrival/departure semi-automatically, with optional manual [[checkin]] offline, like COOLPOSSE
# '''[[Falcon#Itches|Falcon: Itches]]'''

== working on ==
Rough order I'm trying to follow when working on things:
# Things to wiki
# Things to blog
# Things to design
# Things to code
to enable others, myself

Particular things I'm working on for IndieWebCamp and my own site. As well as '''<span id="Itches">Itches</span>'''.

=== personal site functionality ===
'''Personal''' indieweb site functionality (adding to tantek.com) using my own personal content publishing software '''[[Falcon]]'''

High level goals: 

* '''Replace all usage of [[Twitter]] with using my own website instead'''
** This means implementing all [[Twitter#Features]] that I commonly use, in a simplified form, faster, and better, in [[Falcon]]
** '''[[Falcon#Working_On|Falcon: Working On]]'''

* '''Replace all usage of [[Facebook]] with using my own website instead'''. Key use-cases:
** [[event]] posts and POSSE - including [[backfeed]] of all interactions
** [[RSVP]] to / [[reply]] comments on FB events - including [[backfeed]] of all interactions
** [[Falcon#Private_Groups|private groups]]
* Then similarly replace all other [[#silo_posting]].

=== indieweb community ===
'''Community''' things I'm working on - which I welcome help and collaboration on, up to and including taking charge, though I'd like to at least contribute

* updated [[POSSE#Background|POSSE diagram]] in an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Age_%28design%29 Atomic Age design] style, perhaps based on https://33.media.tumblr.com/avatar_4e23d9db292d_128.png <br/>could even use different colored nucleons to represent different post types.

* blog post about [[2015-commitments]]
* goal: document how to use your indieweb site instead of your Tumblr
** fully document all explicit [[Tumblr]] post types (from their UI) and then:
*** indie web equivalent [[posts]] - pages specific to those post types
*** "How to Markup" for each such post type
*** "How to POSSE" for each, listing Tumblr with instructions how to explicitly use correct Tumblr post type
** document How to Import from [[Tumblr]] into specific (implied?) indieweb post types with markup fidelity per "How to Markup" instructions for each.
** How to backfeed interactions on your Tumblr POSSE copies back to your indie posts (including Bridgy option / github issue)
* continue documenting [[vouch#In_Progress|vouch]]
* document seamless [[reply-interface]] (UI) needs and plan: indie-action [[webaction]] markup, [[indie-config]], [http://voxpelli.com/2014/10/indie-config-overview/#try-it-out], web component, x-tag etc. from [[2014/UK|IndieWebCamp UK 2014]]
* fix [[location]] wiki page definition, add h-entry p-location h-geo p-latitude (p-longitude) example markup
* iterate on [[IndieMark]], at least detail specification of Level 3 (every axis), since more people are now pointing at IndieMark[https://twitter.com/LanceCoyote/status/601769426438868992]
** '''[[2013/UK/Indiemark]]''' - complete updating [[IndieMark]] accordingly
* create [[geo-tagging]] wiki article with at least a stub and link to [[location]]
* document [[2014/Cambridge/Demos|IndieWebCamp 2014 Cambridge demos]] similar to [[2014/UK/Demos]] 
** and then blog IndieWebCamp 2014 Cambridge Hack Day demos similar to [http://tantek.com/2014/259/b1/indiewebcampuk-hack-day-https-webactions IndieWebCampUK 2014 Hack Day demos]
* process [[h-card#Issues]] - blocking several indieweb community member personal use-cases
* read <cite>[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/the-return-of-upcomingorg/posts/1010515 Open Source, Teamin' Up, The Stack, and Looking Forward]</cite> (including comments) and:
** contribute/respond from an IndieWeb perspective accordingly to [[Upcoming]], and [https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming/wiki/Use-Cases-and-Feature-Requests Upcoming github wiki use-cases]
* expand [[invitation]] based on [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-10-20#t1413860150589 brainstorm in IRC] re: POSSEing, backfeeding, proxying etc.
** incorporate / bi-directional merge appropriately with [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-event-brainstorming#Invitations microformats h-event invitations brainstorm]
* Document [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-10-23#t1414105046134 using dated permalinks] (from IRC) for both archive.org search enabling (recovering 404d links), and longevity, perhaps on [[permalink]] design.
* Add slides, video, etc. links of PdF IndieWeb talk to https://pdf14.hackpad.com/Save-the-Internet-Keynotes-Zb58Z1QFrJq
** Add anything else relevant IndieWeb related to https://pdf14.hackpad.com/
* IndieWebCamp '''[[2014]]''' NYC - blogging about it afterwards.
* '''[[CASSIS]]''' - update all NewBase60 code to be cc0 (it's good enough, and Will Norris needs it for his Go port!)
* '''[[projects]]''' - continue significant update per [[projects#About_This_Page]]
** update based on projects from [[micropub#IndieWeb_Examples]] because micropub enabled projects are much more powerful
* '''[[reply]] vs [[comments]]''' - split reply permalink vs. comments display under a post.
* '''[[link-preview]]''' - something standard for [[silos]] to implement (in addition to all their variant site-specific approaches) when providing link previews of my permalinks
* '''[[code-of-conduct]]''' - fairly done, worth reviewing/iterating periodically. Keeping here in this list until indiewebcamp shows consistent diverse participation.
* review and simplify [[comments-presentation#How_to_display|comments presentation display]] to remove conditionals that overlap/wrap in odd places (collected 2014-049)
* add some test examples for ellipsizing here: https://github.com/tantek/cassis/issues/14 (collected 2014-049)
* [[social web map]]

And these too which need to get integrated by priority order into Falcon Working On / Itches sections:
* '''[[citation]] UI''' - to provide simple copy/paste UI for citing posts (articles (done), notes, other) from my site.
* '''[[webactions]]''' - to achieve and exceed UX parity with [[Twitter]]'s UI on notes on my own site
* '''[[wiki]]''' - I'd like to implement static-file based wiki-like editing/versioning functionality on the static pages on my site, perhaps with explicit "save" edits posted to my updates as [http://tantek.com/w/Whistle#design d - diff, edit, change] [[posts]].

* [[2017/site-refresh]]
* ... adding more here
* [[to-do]] - help with other IndieWeb community to-do items

== community projects ==
Other community projects that I contribute to to help enable the Indie Web and everyone owning their own data.
* http://microformats.org/ - data formats for the rest of us
** http://microformats.org/wiki/to-do#Tantek - my to do list there

=== previously ===
I used to contribute to these too:
* http://activitystrea.ms/ - formats for sharing "activities", largely defunct except for a low value mailing list (google group). See [[ActivityStreams]] on this wiki for latest thinking.
* http://federatedsocialweb.net/ - community/forum for discussing how to federate among indie web (and other) sites. Started a slow death after W3C took it over. Now just a noisy W3C mailing list populated mostly by armchair architects.

* http://www.google.com/search?nfpr=1&q=site:tantek.com+ownyourdata

== skills ==
I am comfortable with the following indieweb [[creator]] skills:
* coding (HTML, microformats, CSS, some javascript/PHP)
* information architecture (taxonomy, hierarchy)
* URL design
* interaction design

I am working on learning better:
* copywriting
* typography
* visual design

== want to work especially with ==
* visual designers - especially those who have an indieweb presence and want to discuss coding and information architecture improvements.
* UX designers - can never work with too many UX folks.
* good writers/bloggers
* type nerds. who doesn't?

== figured out ==
Things I feel like I've figured out pretty well, have shipped on my own site, can depend on, and am available to help explain to others.
* [[POSSE]], in particular
** [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSE to Twitter]]
