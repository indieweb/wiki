I am working on re-establishing my web presence after not doing anything with my site in quite a while.


== Working On ==
* [[WordPress]] plugin for bookmarks to replace my use of Pinboard. Not quite ready for others to use as I have made some major breaking changes but it's getting there, available on Github: [https://github.com/davidized/wp-bookmarks davidized/wp-bookmarks]
* WordPress plugin to post various metrics like weight, steps/activity, reading logs, etc. Source is not available yet as I keep breaking things as I'm trying to get things up and running.

== Itches ==
* Dig through old backups and bring back previous content that has been lost from my site over the years through switching hosts and CMSes.
