Subscribe if you’re interested in application security, self-hosting, programming, and, of course, AI. I cover various topics like tools, concepts, experiments and others. Get the articles into your inbox once in a while™.

This blog is intended for exploration, learning and sharing - part “portfolio” and part knowledge base. I pursue topics that interest me, mostly related to application security and programming. I will not stick to a schedule - some topics take weeks, some are done in a day. In the end, I’d like to deliver content I’d like to read - and not writing content for content’s sake.

You'll find the email subscription form, I solemnly swear not to abuse your inboxes. If you prefer [https://blog.miloslavhomer.cz/rss RSS], I've got that set up as well.

Sometimes I speak at meetups at conferences. If you'd like to hear one of these topics in a talk, or if you have a general question, hit me up on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/miloslav-homer/ LinkedIn], [https://github.com/ArcHound/ Github] or [http://mailto:blog@miloslavhomer.cz email], happy to talk.
