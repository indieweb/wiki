== Itches ==

* More markup, styling, feeds, etc for what already exists
** mobile layout
** learn more CSS? (probly nah)
** archives, category/tag view
* profile pic
* More automation in posting
** most of this can be thru git hooks tbh
** elisp to auto-populate buffers with metadata and correctly name files
*** maybe auto-export .org files at site gen rather than rely on exporting prior to commit?
** maybe proper CI/CD setup once things get more complicated?
* Webmentions
** self host endpoint
** moderation queue
** eventual integration into content repo -> directly embedded in static site
*** javascript-dependent view of mentions that have hit the endpoint but not got collected by integration job
* Media upload independent of git repos
** sync'd on devices
* XMPP bot for automated note/media posting
