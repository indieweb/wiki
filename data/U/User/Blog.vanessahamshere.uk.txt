I work as a manager in an outsourcing company and my current role does include some technical elements.  

Mostly I prefer to be defined by my hobbies rather than my day job: musician, photographer, crafter.  I play quite a range of instruments: keyboards (piano, organ, piano accordion), guitars (plus mandolin and ukulele), flute. No brass or read-based woodwind.  I enjoy taking photographs and I knit, sew, crochet, bead, do calligraphy - I'll have a go at making most things.

My Indieweb site is [https://blog.vanessahamshere.uk blog.vanessahamshere.uk] which is powered by WordPress. I have other blogs currently hosted on 10Centuries.org - [https://hazardwarning.me.uk hazardwarning] for longer blogging and [https://mydnyghtrose.com mydnyghtrose] for craft-related posts. 

I'm still on the silos: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, but find myself using them less and less, particularly Twitter.  Most of my social engagement is via [https://Micro.blog Micro.blog], [https://social.10centuries.org 10C Social], [https://Plurk.com Plurk] and various Slack groups.


== Working On ==

At the moment I'm still at the stage of refining my blog so it can do the things I want it to. I use it as at short post stream which feeds across to Micro.blog and pulls in replies to my posts as comments.  My current itch is getting micropub working fully, if that's possible.  

I would like to be able to pull in rss feeds that I follow, possibly into a private area, just for me. Ditto Goodreads, though maybe not private.  I have set up a new menu item which displays just "Read" categories.  I hope to add more over time - experimenting with this at the moment.
