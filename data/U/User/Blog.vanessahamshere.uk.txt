I work as a manager in an outsourcing company and my current role does include some technical elements.  

Mostly I prefer to be defined by my hobbies rather than my day job: musician, photographer, crafter.  I play quite a range of instruments: keyboards (piano, organ, piano accordion), guitars (plus mandolin and ukulele), flute. No brass or read-based woodwind.  I enjoy taking photographs and I knit, sew, crochet, bead, do calligraphy - I'll have a go at making most things.

My Indieweb site is [https://blog.vanessahamshere.uk blog.vanessahamshere.uk] which is powered by WordPress. I have other blogs currently hosted on 10Centuries.org - [https://hazardwarning.me.uk hazardwarning] for longer blogging and [https://mydnyghtrose.com mydnyghtrose] for craft-related posts. 

I'm still on the silos: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, but find myself using them less and less, particularly Twitter.  Most of my social engagement is via [https://Micro.blog Micro.blog], [https://social.10centuries.org 10C Social], [https://Plurk.com Plurk] and various Slack groups.


== Working On ==

At the moment I'm still at the stage of refining my blog so it can do the things I want it to. I use it as at short post stream which feeds across to Micro.blog and pulls in replies to my posts as comments.  Inspired by the 2019 summit, I managed to get micropub working, after sorting out Indieauth, which seemed to have stopped working (looking at you, Dreamhost). The instructions provided when running the Indieauth script were spot on; it just took me a couple of goes to get it right on my site. Now this has been fixed, I am trying out microsub/pub using existing servers/apps. I don’t think running my own server is something I’m ready for yet, though never say never.

I would still like to be able to pull in rss feeds that I follow, possibly into a private area, just for me. Ditto Goodreads, though maybe not private.  I have set up a new menu item which displays just "Read" categories.  I hope to add more over time - experimenting with this at the moment.
