Hello, World!

My name is Nathan DeGruchy, and I am the owner of my personal blog at https://degruchy.org.

I am a technologist and Open Source enthusiast living and working in Florida. Often, I can be found playing board games with my family, video games by myself or breaking technological things in order to fix them "better".
