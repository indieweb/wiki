Hello, World!

My name is Nathan DeGruchy, and I am the owner of <a href="https://degruchy.org/" rel="me">degruchy.org</a>.

Right now, I'm sort of "in between" moments in my life where I want to blog and have all the trappings, and wanting to eschew complexity.

My home page is an [[h-card]] and has a small, experimental [[h-feed]] with [[h-entries]] in it for more than 500-character works (longer than a Mastodon "toot").
