== My Code ==

All of the code for my website is available at [https://github.com/jacobwhall/jacobhall.net github.com/jacobwhall/jacobhall.net]

In 2022, I completely rewrote my website in [https://racket-lang.org Racket].

== Future Plans ==

I'm building a set of IndieWeb services so that I can interact with other personal sites socially:
* [https://indieweb.org/Webmention Webmentions]
* [https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers Micropub server]
* [https://indieweb.org/Microsub Microsub server]
* [https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth IndieAuth]

I've begun work on a h-card "contacts directory" that interfaces with each of these services. As I implement each of these, I will update the Examples sections of the corresponding wiki pages (linked above) with a description of my site's functionality.

== Contact ==

The best way to reach me is by email: [mailto:email@jacobhall.net email@jacobhall.net]

There are a few other platforms I use listed on my website, and I'm looking to launch my own [https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/ synapse server] so that I may chat with my friends on [https://matrix.org/ Matrix].
