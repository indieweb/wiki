<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn class="h-card">[https://jacobhall.net Jacob Hall]</dfn>''' is currently a geology undergrad at William & Mary. He's been slowly building his website into an online home, where he can post about what he's learning, interact with his internet friends, and organize the content he wants to keep.</span>

== Future Plans ==

The next thing on my to-do is build a database of all of my posts.
I'd kinda like to do this by hand, but I might look into some of the plug-and-play micropub implementations.
After that, I'll do the following things (roughly in this order):

* Create an RSS feed of my posts
* Implement webmentions on my website so that I can interact with other IndieWeb sites
* Create an automatically-updated feed of content from the sites I follow
