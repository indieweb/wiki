== My Code ==

Al of the code for my website is available at [https://github.com/jacobwhall/jacobhall.net github.com/jacobwhall/jacobhall.net]

== Future Plans ==

I'm building a set of IndieWeb services so that I can interact with other personal sites socially:
* [https://indieweb.org/Webmention Webmentions]
* [https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers Micropub server]
* [https://indieweb.org/Microsub Microsub server]
* [https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth IndieAuth]

I've also begun work on a h-card "contacts directory" that interfaces with each of these services. As I implement each of these services, I will update the Examples sections of the corresponding wiki pages (linked above) with a description of my site's functionality.

Someday, I want to make this project available as a template for others to use. The building blocks will all be open-source and customizable, from the database schema to the HTML. As the different pieces mature, I'll likely break them into different projects, and link them together with [https://indieweb.org/Composer composer] or similar.

After that, I'll experiment with creating a tilde community that hosts customizable personal sites for people using these IndieWeb building blocks. The idea is that we'll be able to use, maintain, and improve the same tools together on the same server. Over time, we'll make it easier for less technical users to join and use our tools to express themselves freely. I've started to draft my plan for this community here.

The best way to reach me is by email: [mailto:email@jacobhall.net email@jacobhall.net]

There are a few other platforms I use listed on my website, and I'm looking to launch my own [https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/ synapse server] so that I may chat with my friends on [https://matrix.org/ Matrix].
