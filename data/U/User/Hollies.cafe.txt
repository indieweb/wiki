== Introduction ==
Hello! I'm new, and very much a beginner at all this. I used to make websites using HTML and basic CSS (anyone remember Dreamweaver?) in the early 90's, but by the early '00s I was chasing a couple little kids around, and I moved into other hobbies. In the spring of '22 I discovered this site, and my interest in blogging was fired up again. I'm here to learn, and hopefully to someday be helpful to other new folks.
