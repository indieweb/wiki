[https://taskboy.com Taskboy.com] has long been the repository for the creations of Joe Johnston, a developer, writer and game designer living in Massachusetts.

On most sites (including IRC), my username is taskboy3000.

My interest in Indie web comes from my growing uneasy at the transition of the Internet into a mall.  Commerce has its place on the web, but I no longer wish to be the product.
