== Who am I ==

Welp, im an lazy author and coder. Mostly coding in golang and rust but if you subtracted twenty some years you'd see me hacking away on vrml in hotdog pro web editor. I loved the freedom of just messing around with ideas in html and javascript but decided I could learn more on the backend. That took me down all sorts of fun adventures.

=== What im working on ===

Currently im just trying to get up to speed with indieweb and start getting my blog to post to all the things when I add posts. So im probably going to end up doing a lot of those things via webworkers or some other lamda system. I really want my website to remain static with all its pieces working independently from vultr, cloudflare or some other 'small' container/FaaS services.

Always soooo much to do, when all I really want to do is drink coffee and write.
