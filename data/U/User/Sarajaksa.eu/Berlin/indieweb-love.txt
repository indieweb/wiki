I like discovering new websites through the IndieWeb and the diverse approaches people have to their own websites + the way they express themselves there and what they express. I am also delighted by new people joining the community and asking question; learning more about the web and how to make it their own. I like that people with different expert-knowledge help eachother where they want.

I'm excited for the future, especially seeing all the new popups and other collaborative events we have started this year, such as the carnivals, that are open to a wide range of people with different interests and fields of expertise.




I love James' excitment about every new idea that he hears. No matter what kind of idea it is. It makes the entire IndieWeb space more welcoming and nice to anybody there.




I am excited about seeing what knew things will people show on their websites. I think that in the last couple of years, we have been seeing a shift in creativity being shiftet from the mostly tehnical space more and more into design, content and collaboration space. I am interested in seeing us going more and more in this direction - as I think this will make IndieWeb community (and not only personal websites) more interested in the people, who have no interest in tech.
