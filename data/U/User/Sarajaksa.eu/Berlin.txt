In the IndieWeb Camp Berlin 2024, I want to try an experiment in the collaborative creating. It is mostly writing, though you are allowed to add anything, that the editing software allows you to.

Feel free to add, edit or remove anything for this pages. You can participate and much or as little as you want. Anybody can participate, regardless of whenever you are here at the camp, or don't participate in the today's camp at all. 

I will keep them open form now to at least the end of the IndieWeb Camp, which will be around 17:00. 

If you have a topic, you want us to try as well, set up your own page and link it in the list below.
