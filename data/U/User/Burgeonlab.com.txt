== Introduction ==
Hello there, thanks for dropping by. I'm Naty and I run a personal blog called BurgeonLab. It's built using [[hugo|Hugo]] and deployed via [https://sourcehut.org/ SourceHut Builds CI]. For more information, see my site's [https://sr.ht/~eclecticpassions/burgeonlab/ README].

Most of the content I write is technology-related, but I've got about ten [https://burgeonlab.com/weeknotes/ weeknotes] under my belt (as of 2025-01-11), so expect some rambles about my other non-tech hobbies, or mundane, daily-life content. Inspired by the many sites in the [[IndieWeb Webring]], I am hoping to expand BurgeonLab into more than just a "tech blog"; but make it into my own personal online hub.

I actually manage two other sites: [https://aperture2iris.com/ one] is still under construction, and the [https://eclecticpassions.net/ other] doesn’t get much attention because I’ve been focused on growing my Hugo static site. Maybe one day I'll combine all of them, but it's undecided. [https://burgeonlab.com/blog/blogging-with-hugo-and-wordpress/]

== Discovering IndieWeb ==
I don't remember exactly when I learnt about the IndieWeb; maybe around late-2024, a while after joining the Fediverse (Mastodon) in mid-2023. After educating myself on the concept of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification enshittification] and becoming much more privacy-aware, I really want to '''own my content''' and stop ''(or greatly reduce)'' using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech Big Tech] services with walled-gardens.
