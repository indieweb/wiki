== Introduction ==
Hello there, thanks for dropping by. I'm Naty and I run a personal blog called Burgeon Lab. It's built using [[hugo|Hugo]] and deployed via [https://sourcehut.org/ SourceHut Builds CI]. For more information, see the site's [https://sr.ht/~eclecticpassions/burgeonlab/ README].

Most of the content I write is technology-related, but I've got 15 [https://burgeonlab.com/weeknotes/ weeknotes] under my belt (as of 2025-02-15), so expect some rambles about my non-tech hobbies, or daily-life content. Inspired by the many sites in the [[IndieWeb Webring]] and different [https://burgeonlab.com/blogroll/ small web directories]; I want Burgeon Lab to grow from “just another tech blog” into my central online personal hub. I plan to publish not only typical blog articles and slash pages, but use [[Micropub]] to replace Big Tech social media style content, and write evergreen notes as a [[digital garden]] that brings all my hobbies together in one place.

I actually have two other sites: a [https://aperture2iris.com/ photography blog] which is ''still'' under construction, and the [https://eclecticpassions.net/ other] doesn’t get much attention because I’ve been focused on growing my Hugo static site. Maybe one day I'll combine all of them, but it's undecided. [https://burgeonlab.com/blog/blogging-with-hugo-and-wordpress/]

== Discovering IndieWeb ==
I don't remember exactly when I learnt about the IndieWeb; maybe around 2024, a while after joining the Fediverse (Mastodon) in mid-2023. After educating myself on the concept of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification enshittification] and becoming much more privacy-aware, I really want to '''own my content''' and stop ''(or greatly reduce)'' using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech Big Tech] services with walled-gardens.

== Itches ''(items not prioritized)'' ==
* Test syndicated publishing of [https://burgeonlab.com/notes/ notes] (aka microblogs) to Mastodon using [https://getindiekit.com/plugins/syndicators/mastodon Indiekit's syndication plugin]
* Create [[now|/now]] and [[ideas|/ideas]] pages
* Import photos and captions from Instagram JSON export to my [https://burgeonlab.com/photos /photos] page
* Investigate if I want to display [[Webmentions]] publicly
* Create a custom endpoint for manual Webmentions submission instead of relying on [https://webmention.io/burgeonlab.com/webmention webmention.io's endpoint]
* Implement auto sending of Webmentions instead of scanning each post with [https://telegraph.p3k.io/ Telegraph]
* Improve content / feed structure 
** Should evergreen notes such as topic lists be under content/pages?
** What is the best way to split content into different RSS/Atom feeds? Should my weeknotes or #personal posts go into the main feed? (Right now, only weeknotes/photos/notes (microblogs) contain "personal", i.e., non-tech content. What if I want to write an article (blog post) that's more personal—should that go into the Main feed or a dedicated feed?
*** [https://pupontech.com/too-much-personal-stuff-2/ AY] recently asked a similar question on their site
* Create an /explore page that acts as a comprehensive overview of all content types
** Currently, there's only an "Explore" drop-down menu in the top nav and a simple list of post types on the [https://burgeonlab.com/about/ /about page]
** Examples of /explore: [https://chrisburnell.com/explore/ Chris], [https://joelchrono.xyz/more/ Joel], [https://flamedfury.com/#explore fLaMEd]
