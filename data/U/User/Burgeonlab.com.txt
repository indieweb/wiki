== Intro ==
Hi, thanks for dropping by. I'm Naty and I run a personal blog called BurgeonLab. It's built using [[hugo|Hugo]] and deployed using [https://sourcehut.org/ builds.sr.ht] CI. For more info, see my site's [https://sr.ht/~eclecticpassions/burgeonlab/ README].

I actually manage two other sites: [https://aperture2iris.com/ one] is still under construction, and the [https://eclecticpassions.net/ other] doesn’t get much attention because I’ve been focused on growing my Hugo static site. Maybe one day I'll combine all of them, but it's undecided. [https://burgeonlab.com/blog/blogging-with-hugo-and-wordpress/]

== Discovering IndieWeb ==
I don't remember exactly when I learnt of the IndieWeb; but it is probably not long after I discovered the Fediverse in mid 2023. After educating myself about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification enshittification] and becoming much more privacy-aware, I really want to '''own my content''' and stop (or greatly reduce) using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech Big Tech] services with walled-gardens.
