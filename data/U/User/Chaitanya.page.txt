== Introduction ==
Hello there! My name is Chaitanya. I started using Weebly, Wix and Wordpress.com around the age of 12. Soon, I was hooked to self-hosted Wordpress. In January 2019, I experimented with [[Micro.blog]] and finally settled with it in June 2020.

Just copy/paste: <code><nowiki>{{chaitanya}}</nowiki></code> into the page where it should appear.

== My Sites ==
=== Active Sites ===
* üå± [https://chaitanya.page/ chaitanya.page] is my only active site since early 2019. It is powered by [[WordPress]] with IndieWeb principles, styled with SemPress and custom CSS. Hopefully, it lasts longer than myself. Previously hosted at Github Pages (till May 2020) and Micro.blog (till August 2020).
