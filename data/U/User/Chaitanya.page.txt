== Introduction ==
Hello there! My name is Chaitanya. I started using Weebly, Wix and Wordpress.com around the age of 12. Soon, I was hooked to self-hosted Wordpress. In January 2019, I experimented with [[Micro.blog]] and finally settled with it in June 2020.

Just copy/paste: <code><nowiki>{{chaitanya}}</nowiki></code> into the page where it should appear.
