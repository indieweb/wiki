== Introduction ==
Hello there! My name is Chaitanya. I started using Weebly, Wix and Wordpress.com around the age of 12. Soon, I was hooked to self-hosted Wordpress. In January 2019, I experimented with [[Micro.blog]] and finally settled with it in June 2020.

Just copy/paste: <code><nowiki>{{Chaitanya}}</nowiki></code> into the page where it should appear.
== Active Domain ==
(https://chaitanya.page/) is my only active domain. It is hosted on [[Micro.blog]]. Hopefully, it lasts longer than myself.

== Defunct Domains ==
* chaitanyajosen.com
* chtny.in
* chutneychutney.com
* cricket.fyi
