I'm currently working on better ways to consume content from around the internet via [https://1feed.app/ 1Feed], a [[feed reader]] with ease-of-use as the top priority. It can also read content from [[silos]] such as [[Twitter]]. The main difference between 1Feed and most other feed readers is than instead of showing a feed of articles/links, it shows a feed of people/sites. Sites that have posted more recently show closer to the top. To access previous articles, users can swipe to the right or use the arrow buttons on desktop.

I have implemented [[webmentions]] on my site via [[webmention.io]].
