== Introduction ==
Hi, I'm John. I'm a retired astronomer. I've been involved with websites at work
and at home for a while, and now have time to play with the sites I'm responsible for.
My early sites were all hand coded, initially html only until I discovered css, but in
recent years I've been using cms tools.

== Websites ==
My primary site ([https://www.marwynandjohn.uk marwynandjohn.uk]) now runs on Wordpress. I am still
trying to decide how best to use my old site ([http://www.marwynandjohn.org.uk marwynandjohn.org.uk])
which is basically hand coded (though editable using tools like Bluefish) 
and basically now an archive. I have also set up [https://www.gm8oti.uk gm8oti.uk] as
my new amateur radio blog site.

== Itches ==
* Sort out the sound and video sections of the main website
* Finish shifting Facebook blog posts to the main website
* Look at publishing individual articles from the main website to here
