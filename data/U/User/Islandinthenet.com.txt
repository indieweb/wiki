__NOTITLE__
= Khürt Williams = 

I’m an [https://www.linkedin.com/in/khurt-williams information security professional] with a background in technology R&D. I enjoy exploring wildlife photography.

== Website ==

My website, <span class="h-card">[https://islandinthenet.com Island in the Net]</span>, is a space where I share thoughts and musings on topics like technology, photography, coffee, craft ale, diabetes, and everyday life. 

Over the years, I’ve experimented with various platforms, including <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">UserLand Manila</a>, Blogger, MoveableType, and WordPress.com, before settling on self-hosted WordPress in 2003. My domain has been part of my online journey for over two decades. These days, my website also incorporates modern web standards like [[RSS]], [[Webmention]], [[posts|Post Kinds]], [[Syndication Links]], [[ActivityPub]], and [[IndieAuth]], thanks to [https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Plugins IndieWeb WordPress plugins].
== Background ==

I’ve worked across various fields, including electrical engineering (R&D), open-source software, system integrations, and cybersecurity. Before 2014, I focused on full-stack web development, using tools like Linux, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Perl, PHP, and JavaScript. Over time, my interests shifted toward systems and application security, which led me to information security architect in 2013.

== Itches ==

Create a custom microformats 2 compatible WordPress theme for my site.

== Working On ==

Nothing at this time.

== WordPress ==

I’ve been using the WordPress platform since 2003, though my blogging journey started long before that. In 2005, I transitioned to self-hosting my WordPress site, giving me greater flexibility and control. I discovered the IndieWeb movement in 2017, which inspired me to integrate modern web standards like Webmentions, Post Kinds, and Syndication Links into my website.
