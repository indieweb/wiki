__NOTITLE__
= Kh&uuml;rt Williams = 
I am an [https://monkeyhill.us information security professional], a former web developer, avid photographer, and technology geek. I am also a craft ale and coffee fanatic.

== Website ==
The <span class="h-card">[https://islandinthenet.com Island in the Net]</span> website is where I share my incoherent random thoughts and rants about technology and photography geekery, coffee, craft ale, diabetes, and life.

I hosted websites on <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">UserLand Manila</a>, Blogger, MoveableType, and WordPress.com before I settled on self-hosted WordPress in 2003. Iâ€™ve had my domain for over 20 years. My website supports [[RSS]] and uses [[Webmention]], [[Semantic Linkbacks]], [[posts|Post Kinds]], [[Syndication Links]] and [[IndieAuth]] via [https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Plugins IndieWeb WordPress plugins].

== Background ==

I have a background in engineering, open-source web development (but I last developed software professionally in 2014), systems integrations, and cyber-security. I am an independent information security architect and risk management consultant with a website, [https://monkeyhill.llc/ Monkey Hill, LLC], hosted on [[Micro.blog]].

== Itches ==
* Create a custom microformats 2 compatible WordPress theme for my site.

== Working On ==

=== WordPress ===

I've used the WordPress platform since 2003 (WordPress), but I was blogging years before that. I started self-hosting my WordPress in 2005. I discovered the IndieWeb movement in 2017. My website supports Webmentions, Post Kinds and Syndication Links.
