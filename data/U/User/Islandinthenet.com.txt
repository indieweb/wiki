__NOTITLE__
= Khürt Williams =

I’m an [https://www.linkedin.com/in/khurt-williams information security professional] with a background in technology R&D. I enjoy exploring wildlife photography and capturing nature through my lens.

== Website ==

My website, <span class="h-card">[https://islandinthenet.com Island in the Net]</span>, is where I share thoughts on technology, photography, coffee, craft ale, diabetes, and everyday life.

Over the years, I’ve experimented with platforms including <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">UserLand Manila</a>, Blogger, MoveableType, and WordPress.com before settling on self-hosted WordPress in 2005. My domain has been part of my online journey for over two decades. Today, it incorporates modern web standards like [[RSS]], [[Webmention]], [[posts|Post Kinds]], [[Syndication Links]], [[ActivityPub]], [[WebSub]], [[Micropub_for_WordPress|Micropub]], and [[IndieAuth]], thanks to [https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Plugins IndieWeb WordPress plugins].

== Background ==

I’ve worked across electrical engineering (R&D), open-source software, system integrations, and cybersecurity. Prior to 2014, I focused on full-stack web development using Linux, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Perl, PHP, and JavaScript. Over time, my focus shifted toward systems and application security, leading to my role as an information security architect in 2013.

== Itches ==

Created a custom Microformats 2-compatible WordPress theme for my site, which I’ve open-sourced: [https://github.com/khurtwilliams/cornerstone Cornerstone on GitHub].

== Working On ==

Nothing at this time.

== WordPress ==

I’ve been using WordPress since 2003, though my blogging journey started earlier. In 2005, I transitioned to self-hosting, giving me greater control and flexibility. I discovered the IndieWeb movement in 2017, inspiring me to integrate modern web standards like Webmentions, Post Kinds, and Syndication Links.
