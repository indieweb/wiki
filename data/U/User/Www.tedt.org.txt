= My IndieWeb Setup =
https:/www.tedt.org/ is my primary home where I post all my stuff via [[micropub]] or Jekyll files to [[github]].
* [[Bridgy]] Monitors Social Media
* [[OwnYourSwarm]] for checkins
* Quill
* [[OwnYourGram]] for some media pieces.  But I hate Instagram and Facebook so this might be temporary.  
* I am using https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github to get micropublishing into Github.
