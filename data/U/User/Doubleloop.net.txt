== Setup ==

I am running my site on [[WordPress]] with the indieweb [[WordPress/Plugins|plugins]].

=== Posting ===

I use [[Indigenous_for_Android|Indigenous for Android]] as a mobile [[Micropub]] client.  

I use the [[Omnibear]] extension in Firefox to [[bookmark]] and [[like]] posts, and also to write new [[notes]].

I sometime use [[shpub]] to post notes from the command line.

For post types that I can't currently post via Micropub (e.g. [[read]]s, [[jam]]s), I will post from the WordPress interface, with all the heavy work done by the [[Post_Kinds_Plugin|post kinds plugin]].

==== POSSE ====

Currently I only [[POSSE]] to Mastodon.  I use the [https://github.com/simonfrey/mastodon_wordpress_autopost Mastodon Autopost] WP plugin, and I added a simple [[syndication_targets|syndication target]] to my theme functions.php ([https://gist.github.com/ngm/20d98e724f7452912942cc4dc401a761 gist here]) so I can syndicate when using Micropub.

=== Reading ===

I use a hosted [[Aperture]] account at [https://aperture.p3k.io aperture.p3k.io] to manage (currently a small number of) [[Microsub]] subscriptions.  I [[reader|read]] them with [[Indigenous_for_Android|Indigenous]].

=== Display ===

I use a [https://github.com/ngm/doublepress customised version] of [https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress SemPress].

== Fixes ==

* Some of my post types don't display very well (e.g. bookmarks, likes)
* My replies sent via webmention are a mess on the receiving site (e.g. my reply here: https://barryfrost.com/2018/07/gumtree)
* Possibly change my theme to a child theme, so I keep up to date with latest SemPress updates

== Itches ==

* Get [[Syndication_Links|syndication links]] working for when I POSSE to Mastodon.
* Figure out a way to play my [https://doubleloop.net/kind/jam jams page] as a streaming playlist
* [[POSSE]] [[bookmark]]s to [[Wallabag]] (or [[PESOS]])
* Filter out likes/bookmarks from my homepage stream, but still have an 'All' page (like barryfrost.com)
* PESOS my parkrun times to my own site
