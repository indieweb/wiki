== Fixes ==

* Some of my post types don't display very well (e.g. bookmarks, likes)
* My replies sent via webmention are a mess on the receiving site (e.g. my reply here: https://barryfrost.com/2018/07/gumtree)

== Itches ==

* Figure out a way to play my [https://doubleloop.net/kind/jam jams page] as a streaming playlist
* [[POSSE]] [[bookmark]]s to [[Wallabag]] (or [[PESOS]])
* Filter out likes/bookmarks from my homepage stream, but still have an 'All' page (like barryfrost.com)
* PESOS my parkrun times to my own site
