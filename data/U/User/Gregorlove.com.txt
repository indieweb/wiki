My name is gRegor Morrill and I have been blogging on https://gregorlove.com since about 2002. By day I am a software developer, primarily using [[PHP]], [[MySQL]], and open source CMS software like [[ProcessWire]].

I first encountered the IndieWeb in 2013 when I came across federated commenting.[https://gregorlove.com/2013/04/federated-comment-thread/] Since then, I've attended several IndieWebCamps; helped organize [[Homebrew Website Club]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Bellingham]]; and helped organize [[2017/Bellingham|IndieWebCamp Bellingham 2017]].

== Contributions ==
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/ProcessWire-Webmention Webmention module] for [[ProcessWire]]
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/ProcessWire-IndieAuth IndieAuth module] for ProcessWire
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention Webmention plugin] for [[Nucleus]] CMS
** As of 2015-07-12 I am no longer using Nucleus CMS on my site or maintaining this plugin.

== My site ==
I was using [[Nucleus]] CMS on my site from 2002 until 2015. The extensibility of it attracted me and served me well for a long time. I contributed to the Nucleus core code and several plugins over the years. I implemented a [[webmention]] plugin [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention] and a plugin for posting [[notes]]. Unfortunately, official development has stopped. After using the [[ProcessWire]] framework professionally for several sites, I migrated my site to that in 2015.

Here are some notes on my implementations:

* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/webmention|webmention implementation]]
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes|notes implementation]]

== Interests ==
Newer items are added at the end. This list is not prioritized.

I am interested in:

* Work on better microformats test coverage in [[php-mf2]]
* Work on upgrading h2vx.com with mf2 support.
* Integrate one or two latest notes (non-replies) on homepage
* Composite feeds
* Feed filtering (don't include likes / most @-replies)
* Set up more [[PuSH]] buttons for article feeds.
* Link posting activity visualization to (new) archive pages.
* Work on a [[ProcessWire]] "IndieWeb Site Profile" that can be easily installed.
* Strip [[EXIF]] from photos posted on my site. Reference http://stackoverflow.com/a/38862429
* Brainstorm [[calendar]] on my own site, including private events.
** Brainstorm a "when is good" page that let's people inquire if I ''might'' be available at a certain datetime.
* Consider option to filter silo responses from fully-IndieWeb responses on https://gregorlove.com/responses/
** Consider additional notification options for these responses as well; I've overlooked some recently like {{cdevroe}}'s response to https://gregorlove.com/2017/05/podcasts-i-am-listening-to/
* Improve reply-contexts when avatar (or other parts) missing from source URL. e.g. https://gregorlove.com/2017/06/im-attending-the-2017-indieweb/
** Fallback to <title> when no mf2
* Default avatar when replying to someone that doesn't have a photo/logo in their h-card
* Bug fix: {{chrisaldrich}} original link doesn't show up for this mention: https://gregorlove.com/2017/12/my-project-for-todays-indiewebcamp/
* Bug fix: ProcessWire Webmention extractURLs() method trimming trailing slash on URLs, causing problems with webmentioning {{Zegnat}}
* Fix utf8 => utf8mb4 mysql encoding for the rest of the site database
* Work on non-JS support of "and X others" link for collapsed likes.
* 2019-06-18: Update reply posts to use `u-in-reply-to` instead of `p-in-reply-to`
