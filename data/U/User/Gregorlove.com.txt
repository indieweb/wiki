My name is gRegor Morrill and I have been blogging on https://gregorlove.com since about 2002. By day I am a software developer, primarily using [[PHP]], [[MySQL]], and open source CMS software like [[ProcessWire]].

I first encountered the IndieWeb in 2013 when I came across federated commenting.[https://gregorlove.com/2013/04/federated-comment-thread/] Since then, I've attended several IndieWebCamps; helped organize [[Homebrew Website Club]] in [[Chicago]], [[Bellingham]], and [[San Diego]]; and helped organize [[2017/Bellingham|IndieWebCamp Bellingham 2017]].

== Contributions ==
* [[ProcessWire Webmention]] module
* [[ProcessWire IndieAuth]] module
* [[indiebookclub]]

=== Previously ===
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention Webmention plugin] for [[Nucleus]] CMS
** As of 2015-07-12 I am no longer using Nucleus CMS on my site or maintaining this plugin.

== My site ==
I was using [[Nucleus]] CMS on my site from 2002 until 2015. The extensibility of it attracted me and served me well for a long time. I contributed to the Nucleus core code and several plugins over the years. I implemented a [[webmention]] plugin [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention] and a plugin for posting [[notes]]. Unfortunately, official development has stopped. After using the [[ProcessWire]] framework professionally for several sites, I migrated my site to that in 2015.

Here are some notes on my implementations:

* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/webmention|webmention implementation]]
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes|notes implementation]]

== Interests ==
=== IndieWeb Projects ===
* Improve [[php-mf2]] test coverage, especially mf1 backcompat
* Migrate [[indiewebify.me]] to a modern framework: https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82

=== Personal Site ===
This list is not prioritized.

* Update archive page to include all post types
* Add back posting activity [[visualization]]
* Strip [[EXIF]] from photos posted on my site. Reference http://stackoverflow.com/a/38862429
* Consider option to filter silo responses from fully-IndieWeb responses on https://gregorlove.com/responses/
** Consider additional notification options for these responses as well; I've overlooked some recently like {{cdevroe}}'s response to https://gregorlove.com/2017/05/podcasts-i-am-listening-to/
* Improve reply-contexts when avatar (or other parts) missing from source URL. e.g. https://gregorlove.com/2017/06/im-attending-the-2017-indieweb/
** Fallback to <title> when no mf2
* Default avatar when replying to someone that doesn't have a photo/logo in their h-card
* Bug fix: {{chrisaldrich}} original link doesn't show up for this mention: https://gregorlove.com/2017/12/my-project-for-todays-indiewebcamp/
* Bug fix: ProcessWire Webmention extractURLs() method trimming trailing slash on URLs, causing problems with webmentioning {{Zegnat}}
* Work on non-JS support of "and X others" link for collapsed likes.
