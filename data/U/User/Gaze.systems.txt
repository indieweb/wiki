<span class="h-card">[https://gaze.systems dusk] does stuff</span>

=== todos ===

* try to actually send proper cache headers, for posts, log etc. and invalidate them properly
* add comment support to posts (probably extend guestbook server to support different "namespaces" and just reuse the UI code)
* subscribe to own rss feed to detect changes for syndication and webmentions
* implement webmentions pushing (maybe just use https://webmention.io/)
* add indieauth support (probably just host indielogin)

=== work done ===

* use dark visitors for some analytics, also serve dark visitors auto robots.txt
* show links on log entries to any syndicated silo posts (which is just bsky for now)
* implemented syndication to bsky from the in-website microblogging
* write an actual about me: wrote some stuff, go me!
