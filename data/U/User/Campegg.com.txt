== Introduction ==

👋🏻 Hi, I'm Cam. I'm a digital product and strategy guy who has been messing about on the web since 1996.

== Current Setup ==

The current iteration of my site runs on [[Django]], but given that my coding skills are—at best!—pretty average, it is mostly held together by duct tape and wishful thinking.

== Itches ==

* <del>Re-enable webmentions</del> ✅
* Fix all the microformats that I busted (🤦🏻‍♂️)
* Add support for [[ActivityPub]] federation
