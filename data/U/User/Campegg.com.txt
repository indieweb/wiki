== Introduction ==

👋🏻 Hi, I'm Cam. I'm a digital product and strategy guy who has been messing about on the web since 1996. (Yes, I'm old.)

== Current Setup ==

The current iteration of my site runs on [[Micro.blog]], but I previously used [[Django]], with a few other Python scripts running in the background that pulled my data down from various silos (Strava, Pocket, Twitter), but given that my coding skills are—at best!—pretty average, it was mostly held together by duct tape and wishful thinking.

== Itches ==

* Decouple API data-fetching from old site and keep it running in the background
* Set up personal wiki-like object
* Create custom Micro.blog theme
