== Introduction ==

👋🏻 Hi, I'm Cam. I'm a digital product and strategy guy who has been messing about on the web since 1996. (Yes, I'm old.)

== Current Setup ==

The current iteration of my site runs on [[Django]], with a few other Python scripts running in the background that pull my data down from various silos (Strava, Pocket, Twitter), but given that my coding skills are—at best!—pretty average, it's mostly held together by duct tape and wishful thinking.

* (Maybe?) Start thinking about some kind of tagging system for my [https://campegg.com/notes/ notes] / [https://campegg.com/posts/ posts]

=== Currently Scratching ===
* Trying to set up [[ActivityPub]] and make my site a full-fledged member of the Fediverse
