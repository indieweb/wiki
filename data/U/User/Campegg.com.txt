== Introduction ==

👋🏻 Hi, I'm Cam. I'm a digital product and strategy guy who has been messing about on the web since 1996.

== Current Setup ==

The current iteration of my site runs on [[Django]], but given that my coding skills are—at best!—pretty average, it is mostly held together by duct tape and wishful thinking.

== Itches ==

* Work out a better way handle incoming webmentions (esp. from Bridgy Fed)
* Bring back reading list
* Fix all the microformats that I busted (🤦🏻‍♂️)
* <del>Re-enable webmentions</del> ✅
* <del>Add "time-of-day" theme switcher</del> ✅
* <del>Bring back Strava activities</del> ✅
* <del>Bring back blogroll</del> ✅
* <del>Add support for [[ActivityPub]] federation</del> ✅
