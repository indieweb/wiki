== Introduction ==

üëãüèª Hi, I'm Cam. I'm a digital product and strategy guy who has been messing about on the web since 1996. (Yes, I'm old.)

== Current Setup ==

The current iteration of my site runs on [[Django]], with a few other Python scripts running in the background that pull my data down from various silos (Strava, Pocket, Twitter), but given that my coding skills are‚Äîat best!‚Äîpretty average, it's mostly held together by duct tape and wishful thinking. If you're interested, I keep a (kinda/sorta) running list of updates going in my [https://campegg.com/about/changelog/ changelog].

== Itches ==
* Add [[Micropub]] support to [https://campegg.com campegg.com] ''(Has anyone done this with Django? Hit me up, please!)''
** Need to wrap my head around how the auth process works first
** Is it even possible (reasonable?) to build something compatible with IA Writer (tool of choice)?
* Add [[POSSE]] to Twitter/Mastodon
* Properly sort out [[webmentions]]
** Receiving works (yay!), but need to figure out how best to display them
* General improvements & tidying-up of current [[microformats]]
* (Maybe?) Start thinking about some kind of tagging system for my [https://campegg.com/notes/ notes] / [https://campegg.com/posts/ posts]
* What does/could minimal, privacy-aware analytics look like?
** More than an old-school hit counter, less than GA, Fathom, Matomo, etc
*** Every solution out there is ''way'' too over-engineered... probably needs to be something custom
** What are the things that I want to know/things that matter to me?
*** Visits ++
*** Page views ++
*** Visitors/sessions --
*** Pathing --
** Could it be built into the Django admin?
** More importantly, why do I want/need analytics?
