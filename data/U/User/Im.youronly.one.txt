This is the beginning of your User profile in IndieWeb.org

== Webmention Setup ==

* Endpoint: [https://webmention.io Webmention.io]
* Script: [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js Webmention.js]
* Backfeeder: [https://brid.gy Brid.gy] (I may use for publishing later)
* Sender: [https://webmention.app Webmention.app] (to setup)

=== Webmention enabled sites/blogs ===

As of 2022-05-02, only 'receive' is implemented and h-card is not complete yet. In addition, though not IndieWeb related, these sites are SchemaOrg JSON-LD enabled, which I initially thought webmention supports.
