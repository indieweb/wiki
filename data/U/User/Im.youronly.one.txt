== Webmention Setup ==

* Receiver: [[webmention.io]]
* Backfeeder: [[brid.gy]]
* Display: [[webmention.js]]

=== Webmention enabled sites/blogs ===

As of 2022-05-02 06:51+0800, only 'receive' is implemented and h-card is not complete yet. In addition, though not IndieWeb related, these sites are SchemaOrg JSON-LD enabled, which I initially thought webmention supports.
