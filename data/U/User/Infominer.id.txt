[https://infominer.id Infominer] is an independent web-worker, committed to making information more accessible; with public domain content, on static sites, and syndicating curated content through various channels.

I have a few Indieweb Static Site themes that I'm learning to use on different sites, as I get to know the specifications which enable them.

  ''The following classes are used to mark up the author bio for Indieweb parsing: h-card, u-photo, p-name, u-url, rel=me, p-locality, p-country-name, u-email, p-note. I’ll be exploring these classes more thoroughly, soon.''

  ''The IndieWeb Community is largely based on principles (AKA tenets) such as own your data, scratch your own itches, build tools for yourself, selfdogfood, document your stuff, open source […] remember to have fun!''
* [https://web-work.tools/indieweb/indiewebcamp-specifications/ Indiewebcamp - Specifications]
   '' The IndieWebCamp community develops several widely implemented specifications, including IndieAuth, Webmention, and Micropub. Additional specifications (like Vouch) are in development. Lastly, IndieWebCamp also makes heavy (re-)use of microformats specifications.''

  ''What I’m hoping for is that folk in the DID community will consider integrating with IndieAuth. This would enable easy adoption for website owners, and make the logical connection between DID and IndieAuth.''

A deploy of [https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb Jekyll Indieweb], that I'm using to organize decentralized-web histories.

A deploy of [https://github.com/dumaurier/pwa_jekyll  PWA Jekyll]

 ''Like all systems involving goals, resources, and actions, computation can be viewed in economic terms. This paper examines markets as a model for computation and proposes a framework–agoric systems–for applying the power of market mechanisms to the software domain. It then explores the consequences of this model and outlines initial market strategies.''
