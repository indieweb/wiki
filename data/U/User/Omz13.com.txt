in alphabetical order:

* avoiding link rot because things on the net have a tendency to [[site-deaths|disappear]] (especially when in a [[silo]]) so some kind of archiving
* avoiding the micro and looking more towards the macro
* [[plurality]] because diversity and interoperability are good
* [[privacy]]

== Working On ==

Making my own [[building blocks]] and sticking them together with gaffer tape and cyanoacrylates to build an Indieweb-friendly website and service.

So far:
* a [[microformat]]-oriented [[cms]] whose content can be updated using [[micropub]] (for use by its built-in editor of external clients like [[Quill]]) or [[wordpress]] api (for use by external clients such as [[MarsEdit]] or [[Author]]).
* [[indieauth]] client and server
* [[micropub]] client and server
* [[webmention]] sending and receiving
* and some other things...

For public use:
* Toolbox[https://toolbox.imoxia.com] a hosted web-app (with an [[IndieAuth]]-gated [[login]]) that offers developers, a way to:
** check that various metadata can be successfully discovered and parsed, including:
*** homepage [[profile]]
*** various IndieWeb [[endpoint]]s
*** authorization server metadata (rfc8414 [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414])
*** blog api using (really simple discovery [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Simple_Discovery]).
** retrieve [[protected]] resources manually by providing a [[bearer_token|Bearer Token]].
