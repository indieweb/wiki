== Itches ==

in alphabetical order:

* avoiding link rot because things on the net have a tendency to [[site-deaths|disappear]] (especially when in a [[silo]]) so some kind of archiving
* avoiding the micro and looking more towards the macro
* [[plurality]] because diversity and interoperability are good
* [[privacy]]

== Working On ==

Making my own [[building blocks]] and sticking them together with gaffer tape and cyanoacrylates to build an Indieweb-friendly website and service.

So far:
* a [[microformat]]-based repository
* [[indieauth]] client and server
* [[micropub]] client and server
* [[webmention]] sending and receiving
* and some other things...
