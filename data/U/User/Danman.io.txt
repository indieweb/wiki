Hello! My name is Daniel Placencia, you can call me DanMan or DanielTheManiel. My website is DanMan.io (give us a visit!) it is my online journal for my never-ending journey on improving my IT skills. I wanted to learn more about how websites work and are managed, so I took it upon myself to build and manage my own. I will be using this site as a blogfolio, Iâ€™ll post my thoughts, personal projects, work projects, and some info about the indie web/self-hosting.
