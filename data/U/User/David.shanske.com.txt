== WordPress for Indieweb == 

One of the smallest yet largest issues is how to integrate Indieweb concepts into WordPress. WordPress has its own way of doing things, and one of the hardest things is to plan things out so they neatly integrate into the system. While WordPress is designed to be extensible, replacing large amounts of core functionality creates implementation issues in the long term.

The challenge, which I and others continue to refine, is to come up with ways to add Indieweb functionality in the least invasive way possible, so that a current user of WordPress could easily add support to their site.

== Working On ==

* Periodically performing bug fixes and minor enhancements to active plugins based on filed issues. Sometimes I get an itch to just knock some issues out of the Github list.

* Travel and Location - Long term...Each step below is necessary before moving on to the next step.
** add better UI support for searching for [[venues]]
** add [[event]] support
** add [[flight]] support

== Hoping to Get to Someday ==
* Continuing to refine the plugins created for WordPress and add more functionality for myself and others.
* Better Support for media posts...read, watch, listen, jam...needs improvement in display
* Event posting
* Link reviews of places to venue page.
