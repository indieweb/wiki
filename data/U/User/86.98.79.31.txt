I’m a podcaster based out of Dubai, UAE. I run the [https://amaeya.fm AMAEYA.FM] podcast network with 4 active shows, with more in development for 2018.

The continuing frustrations at the way social network & platforms have been run over the last few years caused me to look at the progress of the IndieWeb really closely. Recent changes at Medium (the current edition of my blogs and publications at the time) reaffirmed that I needed to get out and it didn’t take long to pick Micro.blog and directly support what is already a fairly mature platform built on the right principles.

Some thoughts:
* [https://www.chirag.biz/2018/07/12/social-media-actually.html Why owning what you publish is so important]
* [https://www.chirag.biz/2018/07/24/free-podcasting-and.html Why the concept of free podcasting makes me increasingly uncomfortable]
