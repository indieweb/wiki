== Working On ==

== Worked On ==
Things I've figured out (or someone's figured out for me) that I can help other people with.
* automatically mark images posted on WP with u-photo to allow for proper cross-posting to Twitter
* (Independent Publisher WP theme) figured out how to stop my avatar from being cross-posted to Twitter
* changing some of the labels in the Post Kinds plugin (eg. changing "Reply to" to "In reply to" - just a personal preference)
* implemented functionalities to allow for categories and post kinds to be pre-selected via URL when loading up the WP post page - this allows for quicker "reply" and "bookmark" post made via mobile
* get site linked to Bridgy
* get Webmentions to work

== Itches ==
