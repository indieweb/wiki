Hey, folks. Sorry to barge in. Most likely I won't be staying. Just had some example links to add on a page, and figured it's just what wikis are for. Hope this helps!

Now, if I were to pick just one IndieWeb spec to keep, it would be [[rel-me]]; it's widely supported already and has many uses, like the link verification on [[Mastodon]] profiles.
