== hi ==

I'm dylan harris, [https://dylanharris.org/ arts & ego] is my identity website. It's been online, in one form or another, since 1996. It's currently got 47G of content, including ... oh, I won't bore you with that.

I visited last year's [https://indieweb.org/2018/Berlin indieweb camp in berlin], and came away fired up to introduce webmentions. I promptly translated the site, badly, into four languages, instead. That summerises how it's been built: if it were a house, it'd have 7 wings, secret passages, fake ghosts, real cobwebs, naughty kitties, and a cellar running a cloud data centre, backwards.

More than once, I've looked at the various CMSs, and more than once I've rejected them for not providing me the precise control & freedom of layout that I want. In consequence, everything is laid out entirely to my own sensibility, a bizarre combination of strange ideas and ancient mistakes. It certainly shows off my own ignorance of standards.

The site is static for two reasons: (i) i don't want to have to waste my time chasing down and clearing out crap from conmen, & (ii) no one likes me (which took years to achieve).

== to do ==

[https://dylanharris.org/ arts & ego] is built with hand-coded compiled shtml, running on apache under [https://www.openbsd.org/ openbsd], on the [https://pcengines.ch/apu2.htm PC Engines APU 2] sitting next to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophytum_comosum spider plant] (note to self: remind the dog to be more careful next time he's watering the plant). I will, at some point, move the site to [https://man.openbsd.org/httpd httpd], the native openbsd web server.

In the longer term, I'll replace my existing bash & python check & build suite with something written in a slightly faster language: 47G of content does have consequences. As interesting as it is to have the time to tour the world by balloon while linkchecker's doing its business, I think I'd prefer a utility that gave just about enough time to give the cat a quick cuddle. I know what to do to build it in [https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ C++], I just need the time to ... oh, ****, have to go, the balloon's boarding.

Most of my time, though, is spent adding content. For example, I like photographing things that don't exist, without photoshopping anything, it's much more fun that photographing the things people usually see. That's why, when I was in Paris last week giving a poetry reading (hey, it ''is'' called arts & ego, what did you expect?!), I nipped over to [https://dylanharris.org/fr/foto/190319k/index.shtml la d√©fense] and took some reflection shots. It's beautiful photography there. The same goes for [https://dylanharris.org/nl/foto/foto/utrecht.shtml utrecht], which is why i hope to visit [https://indieweb.org/2019/Utrecht that forthcoming indieweb camp].
