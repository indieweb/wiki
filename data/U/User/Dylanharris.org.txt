== hi ==

I'm dylan harris, [https://dylanharris.org/ arts & ego] is my identity website. It's been online, in one form or another, since 1996. It's currently got 47G of content, including ... oh, I won't bore you with that.

I visited last year's [https://indieweb.org/2018/Berlin indieweb camp in berlin], and came away fired up to introduce webmentions. I promptly translated the site, instead, into four languages, badly. That summerises how it's been built: if it were a house, it'd have 7 wings, secret passages, fake ghosts, real cobwebs, naughty kitties, and a cellar running a cloud data centre, backwards.

More than once, I've looked at the various CMSs, and more than once I've rejected them for not providing me the precise control & freedom of layout that I want. In consequence, everything is laid out entirely to my own sensibility, a bizarre combination of strange ideas and ancient mistakes. It certainly shows off my own ignorance of standards.

== to do ==

[https://dylanharris.org/ arts & ego] is built with hand-coded compiled shtml. It runs on [https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf.5 httpd], the native [https://www.openbsd.org/ openbsd] webserver, on an [https://pcengines.ch/apu2.htm PC Engines APU 2]. I build it on an elderly Mac Mini with a dreadfully slow home made bash & python suite. My long term goal is to rewrite the suite in C/C++.

I intend to visit [https://indieweb.org/2019/Utrecht the forthcoming Utrecht indieweb camp], mostly for the exchange of ideas, but partially because I love [https://dylanharris.org/nl/foto/foto/utrecht.shtml photographing the city].
