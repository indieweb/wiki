Hi, I'm <span class="h-card">[https://unrelenting.technology Greg]</span>! My [[IRC]] nick is unrelentingtech (used to be myfreeweb).

== unrelenting.technology current status ==

Built with (a very mild fork of) [[Zola]] and uploaded to [[Amazon S3]] in [[GitHub]] Actions CI, served via [[Cloudfront]], [[webmention.io]] used for mentions for now, with a tiny [[Glitch]] app to convert the wmio webhook into a GitHub Actions rebuild command.

WIP: Python app running in [[AWS Lambda]] providing [[authorization-endpoint]], [[token-endpoint]], TODO: [[Micropub]], eventually take over webmentions too, maybe [[Microsub]].

== Projects ==

[[sweetroll]] 1 and 2 were the engines that used to power [https://unrelenting.technology unrelenting.technology] in the past.
A bunch of libraries were written for sweetroll 1 and 2, check the sweetroll page for links.

[https://github.com/unrelentingtech/micro-panel micro-panel] is a client side entry editor for [[Micropub]].
