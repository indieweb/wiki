Hi, I'm <span class="h-card">[https://unrelenting.technology Greg]</span>! My [[IRC]] nick is myfreeweb. [http://my.pronoun.is/they/them my.pronoun.is/they/them].

== Projects ==
[[sweetroll]] is the engine that powers my website, [https://unrelenting.technology unrelenting.technology].

I wrote the following libraries that are used in Sweetroll:
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/magicbane a small Dropwizard-like Haskell "framework" based on Servant]
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/http-link-header a parser for the HTTP Link header]
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/microformats2-parser a parser for Microformats 2]
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/indieweb-algorithms indieweb-algorithms], implementations of algorithms like [[authorship]]
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/pcre-heavy pcre-heavy], a regular expressions library
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/hs-duktape hs-duktape], bindings to [http://duktape.org duktape], a small JavaScript interpreter
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/indieweb-components a collection of lightweight Web Components] for [[webactions]] / [[indie-config]], [[fragmentions]] (used in Sweetroll).
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/micro-panel a Web Components and Micropub based admin panel]
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/mf2sql a PostgreSQL schema for Microformats2 storage]

[https://myfreeweb.github.io/foxshare/ FoxShare] was a tiny web page for adding anything (e.g. [[Micropub]] clients such as [[Quill]] and [https://micropublish.herokuapp.com Micropublish]) to (R.I.P.) [[Firefox Share]].
