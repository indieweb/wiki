Hi!

I'm alan.

It's Dec. 2020 and I'm new here.

My brain's been spinning on the idea of the IndieWeb for a while. Just setup my webmentions. Was way easier than I thought. So cool. 

I'm doing the Digital Garden thing with my site. Just started a couple weeks ago. I haven't had this much fun working on my site in 20 years. 

my site is at: [https://www.alanwsmith.com/ alanwsmith.com]

and I'm on twitter at: [https://twitter.com/TheIdOfAlan TheIdOfAlan]

and twitch with the same username: [http://twitch.tv/theidofalan TheIdOfAlan]
