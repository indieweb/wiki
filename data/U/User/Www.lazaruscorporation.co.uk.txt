== A Quick Introduction ==
I am a visual artist - primarily working in drawing, photography, and printmaking. 

In my day job I've been a Front End/<abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> developer, a development team manager, and I am now working as a solution architect (for the past 8 years or so).

== My Website ==
My website is at https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/ where you can find more [https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/artists/paul-watson about me] or read my blog [https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook The Artistâ€™s Notebook]. 

My site is focused on my artwork and my writing about my artistic practice. There is some artwork and writing by other artists and writers archived on there as well, but these days it is all about my artwork and writing.

=== Technologies ===

My site is hand-coded <abbr>PHP</abbr> on a lightweight third-party <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr> framework. No third-party <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> or <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> libraries are used. No analytics packages (apart from server-side logs) are used.

I've implemented [[microformats]] on many pages now, but I'm sure there are still some missing.

I maintain a changelog for my site at https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/info/version

=== Things I've done this past few weeks (and will likely be doing over the next few weeks) ===
* Continued work on implementing a back-end CMS (work-in-progress)
* Continued work on implementing ActivityPub protocol for my blog (work-in-progress)

=== Itches ===

* Ability to follow my artwork using ActivityPub e.g. on Mastodon, PixelFed, etc.,

== Other Projects ==

* Back in 2014 I led the development of https://schema.org/VisualArtwork released in schema.org v 1.93 in February 2015 ([http://blog.schema.org/2015/02/schemaorg-v193-visualartwork-invoices.html launch blog post])
