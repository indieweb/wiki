== A Quick Introduction ==
I am a visual artist - primarily working in drawing, photography, and printmaking. 

In my day job I've been a Front End/UI developer, a development team manager, and I am now working as a solution architect (for the past 8 years or so).

== My Website ==
My website is at https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/ where you can find more [https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/artists/paul-watson about me] or read my blog [https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook The Artistâ€™s Notebook]. 

My site is focused on my artwork and my writing about my artistic practice. There is some artwork and writing by other artists and writers archived on there as well, but these days it is all about my artwork and writing.

=== Technologies ===

My site is hand-coded PHP on a lightweight third-party MVC framework. No JS or CSS libraries are used. No analytics packages (apart from server-side logs) are used.

I've implemented [[microformats]] on many pages now, but I'm sure there are still some missing.

I maintain a changelog for my site at https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/info/version

=== Things I've done this past week ===
* Implemented an initial version of [[dark mode]]
* A few more CSS improvements and tweaks to the whole of the website

=== Things I'm planning to do in the forthcoming week or two ===
* Investigate implementing [[Bridgy]] with my basic POSSE Posts setup
* Something fun with my 404 page

=== Itches ===

* Ability to follow my blog using ActivityPub e.g. on Mastodon, PixelFed, etc.,
* Ability to follow my artwork using ActivityPub e.g. on Mastodon, PixelFed, etc.,
* Display responses to blog posts received via Webmentions and PingBacks.
* Move my Notes from various social media platforms to self-hosted and then feed them to the external platforms [[POSSE]]-style (in progress!)

== Other Projects ==

* Back in 2014 I led the development of https://schema.org/VisualArtwork released in schema.org v 1.93 in February 2015 ([http://blog.schema.org/2015/02/schemaorg-v193-visualartwork-invoices.html launch blog post])
