Hi, I’m Adam Buice, and my home base on the web is '''[https://adambuice.com/ adambuice.com]'''.

This site is mostly personal: short notes on family life, gratitude, and the small moments that keep me grounded. I’ll occasionally share a work-related perspective too, but I try to keep things human-first.

== A little about me ==
* I’m married to Meghan, and we have three daughters: Reagan, Emmy, and Grace.
* I’m based in North Georgia.
* Before what I do now, I spent about 10 years in commercial banking (my mom — a Realtor — nudged me toward residential lending).

== What I write about ==
* Family, perspective, and everyday routines
* Community + relationships
* Lessons I pick up along the way (sometimes from work, sometimes from life)
