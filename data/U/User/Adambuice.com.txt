Hi, I’m Adam Buice, and my home base on the web is '''[https://adambuice.com/ adambuice.com]'''.

I’m a mortgage loan officer with [https://migonline.com/ Mortgage Investors Group], and I help people make homeownership (or refinancing) feel clear and doable — especially when the process feels confusing or stressful.

== What I’m focused on ==
* Purchase + refinance loans
* Helping buyers get prepared (and staying steady all the way to closing)

== How I got here ==
Before mortgages, I spent about 10 years in commercial banking. My mom (a Realtor) encouraged me to apply what I learned there to residential lending — and that push changed my career path.

== A little more personal ==
When I’m not working, I’m usually with my wife, Meghan, and our daughters (Reagan, Emmy, and Grace).

== Writing ==
I publish articles and mortgage advice here:
