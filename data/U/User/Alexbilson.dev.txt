Alex Bilson is a U.S. Navy vet with over a decade in technology as a software engineer and consultant. He's a combination business and technical liaison who delights to solve complex, disorganized problems with collaborative exploration and coaching. His interest in the IndieWeb began when he sought out how to interact with others on the Internet without a Facebook account.
