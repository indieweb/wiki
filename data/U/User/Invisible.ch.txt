Old timer on the web, blogging since late 1990s, resurrected my blog beginning of 2019 and discovered IndieWeb while browsing Hugo templates. IndieWeb resonates incredibly with me, so set out to get my new blog theme IndieWebified.

== My Indieweb Setup ==
* '''Main''' Site using [[hugo]] - [https://invisible.ch invisible.ch]
** Fully marked up h-card and h-entry (I hope)
** Hugo Theme "Chaschper" with various IndieWeb parts available [https://github.com/jcfischer/chaschper on GitHub]
** Hosted on Netlify
** Using [http://webmention.io webmention.io] as webmention endpoint
** Backfeed with Brid.gy

== Itches ==
* Investigate the use of Lambda functions to handle various dynamic aspects of the IndieWeb
* Ideas 
** Post via web (and commit into Repo that hosts site, which will trigger a redeploy)
** Endpoint for Webmentions
