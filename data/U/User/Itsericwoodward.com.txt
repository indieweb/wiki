== Current IndieWeb Setup ==

As of 2018-07-22, my IndieWeb setup consists of the following components:

+ https://itsericwoodward.com serves as my primary h-card profile, and is used for logging in via [[IndieAuth]]. It's on the [[indiewebring | üï∏üíç]] at [https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/1Ô∏è‚É£üñ≤  1Ô∏è‚É£üñ≤].
* https://blog.itsericwoodward.com hosts my blog, running [[Known]] v0.9.9 (with some extra special plugins). 
* https://www.itsericwoodward.com - My personal site, consisting of static pages built by [[Node]] Gulp.
* https://git.itsericwoodward.com - My git repos, running [[Gitea]] v1.4.3.

== Previous IndieWeb Setup ==

Between 2016 and 2017, I used a custom-built blogging platform called `orfeus`, which used the Harp.js library to build static pages (with full [[mf2]] support). In 2018, the code stopped working, so I migrated to a fresh web site and started re-using my old blogging site for posting updates.

== Itches ==
* Implement [[reacji]]s in [[Known]].
* Implement quotes in Known.
* I like Known, but I'd really love to move all of my posts to something that uses static text for its backend (to improve reliability).
* Try checking my site in indiewebify.me
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site
* More to come
