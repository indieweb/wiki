== My IndieWeb Setup ==

https://itsericwoodward.com serves as my primary h-card profile, and is used for logging in via [[IndieAuth]]. Additionally, it contains the links to my other sites:

* https://blog.itsericwoodward.com - My blog, running [[Known]] v0.9.9 (with some extra special plugins).
* https://www.itsericwoodward.com - My personal site, consisting of static pages built by [[Node]] [[Gulp]].
* https://git.itsericwoodward.com - My git repos, running Gitea v1.4.3.

== Itches ==
* Implement [[reacji]]s in [[Known]].
* Implement quotes in Known.
* I like Known, but I'd really love to move all of my posts to something that uses static text for its backend (to improve reliability).
* Try checking my site in indiewebify.me
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site
* More to come
