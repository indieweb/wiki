Howdy. I am <span class="h-card">[https://jmac.org/ Jason McIntosh]</span>. I live in New York City. I get paid to write about databases. I don't get paid to write about other stuff, but I do it anyway.

On [https://chat.indieweb.org IRC] and elsewhere, I go by <strong>jmac</strong>.

My personal domain is [https://jmac.org jmac.org], and I also keep a separate, general-interest blog at [https://fogknife.com fogknife.com].

I am especially interested in IndieWeb's potential for revitalizing the concept of the personal blog. My favorite IndieWeb technology is [[Webmention]].

== IndieWeb tech I've made ==

* I created [[Whim]], a command-line program and Unix daemon for receiving, sending, and displaying [[webmentions]].
* I maintain two Indieweb-related programming libraries for Perl: [[Web::Mention]] and [[Web::Microformats2]].

== Fediverse stuff ==

I am an admin on [http://masto.nyc masto.nyc], a regional Mastodon server for New York City. I post there as [https://masto.nyc/@jmac @jmac@masto.nyc].
