Howdy. I am <span class="h-card">[https://jmac.org/ Jason McIntosh]</span>, an independent creative and software professional who lives in New England.

On IRC and elsewhere, I go by <strong>jmac</strong>. You may call me whatever you like.

I am very interested in IndieWeb's potential for revitalizing the concept of the personal blog, and I wish to study this further through experimentation by way of my own blog software.

I publish <a href="https://fogknife.com">a weekly-ish blog called <em>Fogknife</em></a>. Since 2014 it has run on [[Plerd]], a static-site generator of my own design (as well as a free and open-source project). I have again and again sought ways to integrate comments or other feedback mechanisms into Fogknife, and hadn't found any that impressed me -- until early 2018, when another blog I regularly read started using IndieWeb magic to make comments and replies from across the internet, including silos like Twitter and Facebook. It seemed impossible, but there it was.

I want some of this for myself. If, after all my experimentation and hackery, it ends up seeming worthwhile, then I'll also want to help make this easier for other self-publishing writers to accomplish.

But, first things first.

== Itches ==
* Add [[Web::Mention]] to [[Webmention]]'s list of official implementations.
* Release version 2.0 of [[Plerd]], including complete Webmention support.
** Add a webmention moderation tool of some sort to Plerd.
** Meaningfully document why anyone should care about this stuff.
** I actually snuck in Webmention support as of version 1.6 (August 2018), but it still needs the above.
* Add [[Micropub]] support to Plerd.
* Retire Twitter as the base of my online presence, focusing more on posting to my own website(s) and syndicating as appropriate.

== Scratched itches ==
* Finish fixing up my personal websites with [[h-card]] and [[h-entry]] stuff and so on. (Finished late April, 2018; see [http://fogknife.com Fogknife])
* Share any [[microformats2]] or Webmention-specific libraries I create with <a href="https://metacpan.org">the CPAN</a>, for other Perl hackers to use. (Accomplished (which is not to say "finished") April 2018; see [[Web::Microformats2]] and [[Web::Mention]])
* Updated [[Plerd]] to automatically and protocol-correctly send meaningful [[webmentions]] when publishing new or updated posts. (Accomplished May 2018, in a public experimental branch.)
* Updated [[Plerd]] to receive and meaningfully render webmentions. (Accomplished May 2018, in a public experimental branch.)
