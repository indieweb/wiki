Howdy. I am <span class="h-card">[http://jmac.org/ Jason McIntosh]</span>, an independent creative and software professional who lives in New England.

On IRC and elsewhere, I go by <strong>jmac</strong>. You may call me whatever you like.

I am very interested in IndieWeb's potential for revitalizing the concept of the personal blog, and I wish to study this further through experimentation by way of my own blog software.

I publish <a href="http://fogknife.com">a weekly-ish blog called <em>Fogknife</em></a>. Since 2014 it has run on <a href="https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd">Plerd</a>, a static-site generator of my own design (as well as a free and open-source project). I have again and again sought ways to integrate comments or other feedback mechanisms into Fogknife, and hadn't found any that impressed me -- until early 2018, when another blog I regularly read started using IndieWeb magic to make comments and replies from across the internet, including silos like Twitter and Facebook. It seemed impossible, but there it was.

I want some of this for myself. If, after all my experimentation and hackery, it ends up seeming worthwhile, then I'll also want to help make this easier for other self-publishing writers to accomplish.

But, first things first.
