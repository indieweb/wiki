Howdy. I am <span class="h-card">[https://jmac.org/ Jason McIntosh]</span>, a writer in New York City.

On [https://chat.indieweb.org IRC] and elsewhere, I go by <strong>jmac</strong>. On some online spaces, particularly gaming-focused ones, I am also known as <strong>halstrick</strong>.

My personal domain is [https://jmac.org jmac.org]. Other domains I run:

* [https://fogknife.com fogknife.com], a general-interest blog that I started in 2014. I still update it with longer-form public writing occasionally.
* [https://venthuffer.com venthuffer.com], an audio zine about the Steam Deck video game console.

== IndieWeb tech I've made ==

* I created [[Whim]], a command-line program and Unix daemon for receiving, sending, and displaying [[webmentions]].
* I maintain two Indieweb-related programming libraries for Perl: [[Web::Mention]] and [[Web::Microformats2]].

== Fediverse stuff ==

I am an admin on [http://masto.nyc masto.nyc], a regional Mastodon server for New York City. I post there as [https://masto.nyc/@jmac @jmac@masto.nyc].
