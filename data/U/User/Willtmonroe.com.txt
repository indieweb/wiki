== Introduction ==



== Website ==
[https://willtmonroe.com My website]

== Working On ==
* '''Using mobile bookmarklets'''--see [https://boffosocko.com/2017/01/10/browser-bookmarklets-and-mobile-sharing-with-post-kinds-plugin-for-wordpress/ Chris Aldrich's post]--to work reliably as I post from my phone to my Wordpress site.
* Wrapping my head around '''how Categories and Post Kinds can be used''' on my WordPress site.  Ton Zylstra has  some helpful posts describing [https://www.zylstra.org/blog/wordpress-set-up/ how he configured his website], his use of [https://www.zylstra.org/blog/feeds/ feeds], Categories, and a plugin called:  [https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-category-excluder/ WordPress Ultimate Category Excluder].

== Itches ==

*'''Highlighting & Quotes'''. Copy the highlight and quote formatting approach [https://indieweb.org/highlight#Chris_Aldrich described] and [https://boffosocko.com/2018/06/21/some-thoughts-on-highlights-and-marginalia-with-examples/ reflected upon] by Chris Aldrich.
*'''WordPress Child Theme Modifications'''.  Modify [https://github.com/pfefferle/Autonomie Autonomie ] WordPress theme by [https://notiz.blog/ Matthias Pfefferle] to clean up the display of some icons, Category and Post Kind descriptions, and other changes.
