== Itches ==

- '''Highlighting & Quotes'''. Copy the highlight and quote formatting approach [https://indieweb.org/highlight#Chris_Aldrich described] and [https://boffosocko.com/2018/06/21/some-thoughts-on-highlights-and-marginalia-with-examples/ reflected upon] by Chris Aldrich.

- '''Hum URL Shortener'''.  Investigate the uses for a WordPress-based URL shortener like [https://wordpress.org/plugins/hum/ Hum].  Is this plugin consistently maintained?  Will it get along with the other Indieweb [[WordPress/Plugins]]?
