Christin Wixson is a librarian at Plymouth State University. 

I am very interested in how big tech impacts the way people search for, bump into, and interact with information and what alternatives exist to this warped reality.

My other interests include information/digital/media literacy, copyright, open licenses, personal learning networks, and as of quite recently, digital gardens.  I have no web development background which makes me feel like an imposter in some of those spaces, but I want to explore how these things interact and how conversations about these topics can be brought to students (and anyone really) with limited technical experience. 

I have a standard wordpress blog, [[Odd Blog|http://christinwixson.com/]], but I donâ€™t post frequently.  Even though I just discovered digital gardening in March of 2021 I have a pretty large TiddlyWiki (technically Stroll).  It is currently unpublished as I figure out both how to put a TW on the web and what kinds of things I want share publicly for feedback vs what kind of space I want for private processing.
