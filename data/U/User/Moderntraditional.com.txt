Hello :-)
I've set up my IndieWeb on [https://moderntraditional.com moderntraditional.com]
You can find me on Mastodon @webmatron@moderntraditional.com

You can visit my personal blog at [https://ironwynch.com/scrolls IronWynch.com/scrolls] and subscribe to that on Mastodon @nicole@ironwynch.com

ModernTraditional.com is a project I started in about 1996 to share information about my cultures and assist others in sharing theirs with the world as well. We've developed over the years into a group of friends and associates who come from many different backgrounds but share a common dream of a peaceful and sustainable future for humanity.

The site covers a wide range of topics and I have had to compartmentalize a bit and open quite a few domains to cover that range in an organized manner. I both create and curate content. As to curation, the way things work is that people let me know they're interested in being featured, or I find someone interesting and post about them. The site is supported by donations from people who've benefited from the promotion or from some blessing they found because of it.

We don't shy away from the hard topics, and believe in historical accuracy and un-romanticized cultural representation. We go deep, and just to be clear, we are LGBTQIA+ welcoming and often centering. We respect tradition and even some nostalgia, but bigotry is not something we wish to perpetuate. Also, it needs to be made more clear that not all traditional cultures were or are bigoted.

So visit the site, explore, and if you find someplace you can contribute, feel free. If you're doing something interesting, and you want us to feature you, let us know. It's free. You can donate if it does something for you.
