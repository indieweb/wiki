Generation X Web 1.0 former web developer and newbie archivist, now tinkering on my personal site for fun. In the past I've been involved in a number of communities and special interest groups encouraging diversity and inclusion in technology, including LinuxChix, Women in Drupal, Drupal Rainbow, and LGBTQ in Technology.

I was a professional Drupal and WordPress developer for a few years but now that I've changed careers I've returned to the simplicity of static websites – currently using [[Hugo]]. I built my first websites in the 1990s on [[GeoCities]] and on my university student web space (can't remember which came first). I've used '''claudinec''' as my primary nick since around 2001 and '''claudinec.net''' as my primary domain since 2010, but have not been diligent about keeping URLs permanent across the various iterations of my self-hosted sites. It's not great archiving practice but I'm resolved to do better now.

== Itches ==

* own my [[acquisition]]/consumption lists/[[personal library]], a possible use case for [[Hugo]] [https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/ data templates]
** [[books]] – I have [[LibraryThing]] and [[Goodreads]] accounts which I haven't touched for years
** film and TV [[viewing]] – currently sort of using JustWatch
** music – [[Last.fm]] (automated [[scrobbles]] from multiple sources; could be used to compile my own weekly/monthly/yearly recaps)
** [[coffee]] – I track coffee beans and brews with the [https://beanconqueror.com/ Beanconqueror] phone app which can export JSON and Excel data
