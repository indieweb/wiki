Generation X Web 1.0 former web developer and newbie archivist, now tinkering on my personal site for fun. In the past I've been involved in a number of communities and special interest groups encouraging diversity and inclusion in technology, including LinuxChix, Women in Drupal, Drupal Rainbow, and LGBTQ in Technology.

I was a professional Drupal and WordPress developer for a few years but now that I've changed careers I've returned to the simplicity of static websites. I built my first websites in the 1990s on [[GeoCities]] and on my university student web space (can't remember which came first). I've used '''claudinec''' as my primary nick since around 2001 and '''claudinec.net''' as my primary domain since 2010, but have not been diligent about keeping URLs permanent across the various iterations of my self-hosted sites. It's not great archiving practice but I'm resolved to do better now.

== Current setup ==

* [[static site generator]]: [[Hugo]], source code in [[git]]
** private [[gitolite]] repo on private home network with lots of abandoned drafts and experiments
** public repo on [https://github.com/claudinec/www.claudinec.net GitHub] for published <code>main</code> branch as well as thinking/drafting in public
* [[web hosting]]: [[NearlyFreeSpeech]] (✅ 2024-04-01 expand these pages with more info about NFSN)
* [[deployment]] workflows:
** develop/test locally, preview with <code>hugo server</code> or <code>hugo build</code>
** deploy to production:
*** push code to [[GitHub]]
*** SSH to web host and pull from GitHub
*** run <code>hugo build</code> on web host

== Itches ==

* own my [[acquisition]]/consumption lists/[[personal library]], a possible use case for [[Hugo]] [https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/ data templates]
** [[books]] – I have [[LibraryThing]] and [[Goodreads]] accounts which I haven't touched for years
** film and TV [[viewing]] – currently sort of using JustWatch
** music – [[Last.fm]] (automated [[scrobbles]] from multiple sources; could be used to compile my own weekly/monthly/yearly recaps)
** [[coffee]] – I track coffee beans and brews with the [https://beanconqueror.com/ Beanconqueror] phone app which can export JSON and Excel data
