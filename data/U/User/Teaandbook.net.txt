I used to make websites using HTML and basic CSS (anyone remember Dreamweaver?) in the early 90's, but by the early '00s I moved into other interests. I recently discovered this site, and it renewed my interest in learning how to manage my own self-hosted WordPress site. Here to learn, and hopefully be able to help others someday.
