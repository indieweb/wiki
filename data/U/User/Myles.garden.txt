Hey, I’m [https://myles.garden myles], a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦. I spend my days building systems on the web and my evenings tinkering with side projects, photography, and whatever catches my curiosity.

== Myles' Garden ==

I built my site using [[Astro]] and it’s currently hosted on [[Vercel]] (I hope to move away from Vercel soon). I sometimes [https://myles.garden/tags/colophon write about the development of the site], keep a [https://myles.garden/roadmap public roadmap], and collect development notes in [https://grimoire.myles.garden/projects/myles-garden Myles' Grimoire].

=== Satellites ===

Satellites are subdomain sites I run that support my main site.

* [https://data.myles.garden Myles' Dataset]: a Datasette powered interface over a [[SQLite]] database of my site's content.
* [https://grimoire.myles.garden Myles' Grimoire]: my [[commonplace book]]/[[digital garden]]/[[wiki]].
* [https://registry.myles.garden Myles' Registry]: a personal registry inspired by (and mildly parodying) [https://www.factoryrecords.org/periodic-table-of-factory-records.php Factory Records' catalog system].
