Colin Morris has been web coding since 1995.

=== My setup ===

I used WordPress for some time until the plugin and main query started grating and I coded my own blogging tool in PHP. It converts Markdown committed to a .git repository into HTML of various templates. It currently runs on a Golang translation of the same logic, and the Twitter syndication has been replaced with a Markdown syndication (POSSE). Indieweb logic is automatically incorporated into template outputs.

Many thanks to the Brid.gy author for making web mentions much easier to utilise.
