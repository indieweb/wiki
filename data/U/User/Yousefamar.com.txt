Howdy folks! I write about tech projects and sometimes horticulture at https://yousefamar.com/memo/log/. Also on [[Gemini]] at gemini://yousefamar.com/.

I am a strong believer in protocols over platforms and '''independence''' as a general overarching theme. A lot of my interests (e.g. self-sufficiency, permaculture, automation, entrepreneurship) stem from this core value.
