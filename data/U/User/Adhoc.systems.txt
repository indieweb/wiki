== Booth ==
My site is running my custom built CMS that I call Booth. Right now it has simple support for [[micropub]] that includes notes and replies. I plan to implement other IndieWeb building blocks such as:
* Webmentions
* a Micropub client
* Micropub server/client

I have long term plans to add [[ActivityPub]] support, too.
