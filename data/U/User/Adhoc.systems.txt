= [https://adhoc.systems Zachary Dunn] =

I'm Zachary Dunn, a software developer in Greenville, South Carolina. For work, I prefer web development but also work with Java. I'm in the process of learning Rust, which I'm using to build my site. My site is running a custom built CMS that I call Booth. Right now it has simple support for [[micropub]] that includes notes and replies.

<div class="p-summary">
