[https://cjwillcock.ca/ CJWillcock.ca] was set up on 2018-May-31. I've had the domain for awhile. The site is the minimal HTML to login with IndieLogin.com to this wiki, and begin a little indie web adventure.

= Motivation =
I stopped publishing original content online, other than some code, years ago. This includes all the social media stuffs, whether in silos or otherwise. I lately was reacquainted with the '''F'''earfully '''B'''ig one, to be an outreach channel for community organizations I enjoy (Rotary, and a Makerspace). My experience with that was disheartening -- everyone online but so few autodidacts! What are you guys doing with your time on here?!?! So &hellip; I was on hold for awhile. 

I have more time lately and will do some in-the-open stuff again now. I'm reading terms of service for silo A, news about silo B and &hellip; no, just no. My pleasure is to produce original content on my own terms. Starting ''from scratch'' more or less (because it's hard lol). I'm very glad to find the IndieWebCamp community here.
