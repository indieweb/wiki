= Working On =
* HWC Summerside in Prince Edward Island, Canada, second meeting is 05/02. Event is at the Makerspace, and I'm trying to get Makerspace members to come out. Two so far! I'm doing no-charge webhosting deal on my own servers for Makerspace members. I don't have a business or service that offers this, but rather am sharing my own stack. I'm going to propose the Makerspace cover cost of domain registration for members that want to own their own domain at the next member's meeting. I know it's not quite owning your own domain, but I've heard the domain fee is cost prohibitive for the members that are already doing a $30 / mo. membership fee there.
