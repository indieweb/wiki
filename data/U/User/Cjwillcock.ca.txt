= Tier-2 Itch =
* is there any activity around extending the HTML spec to include a _meta_ global attribute for elements? Anything similar (or previously shot down)? My specific use case: for the exclusive purpose of including machine-readable data. Contrast this with the current _class_ global attribute, which may or may not have machine-readable data there.

= Motivation =
I stopped publishing original content online, other than some code, years ago. This includes all the social media stuffs, whether in silos or otherwise. I lately was reacquainted with the '''F'''earfully '''B'''ig one, to be an outreach channel for community organizations I enjoy (Rotary, and a Makerspace). My experience with that was disheartening -- everyone online but so few autodidacts! What are you guys doing with your time on here?!?! So &hellip; I was on hold for awhile. 

I have more time lately and will do some in-the-open stuff again now. I'm reading terms of service for silo A, news about silo B and &hellip; no, just no. My pleasure is to produce original content on my own terms. Starting ''from scratch'' more or less (because it's hard lol). I'm very glad to find the IndieWebCamp community here.
