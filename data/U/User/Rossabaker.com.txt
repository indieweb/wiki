<span class="h-card">[https://rossabaker.com/ Ross A. Baker]</span> is an Indieweb enthusiast.  He had a personal website in the late 90s and took a couple decades off, but events of the early 2020s reminded him why it was both fun and important.  He is learning a lot from this wiki and intends to give back during his journey.
