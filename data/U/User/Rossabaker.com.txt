<span class="h-card">[https://rossabaker.com/ Ross A. Baker]</span> is an Indieweb enthusiast.  He had a personal website in the late 90s and took a couple decades off, but events of the early 2020s reminded him why it was both fun and important.  He is learning a lot from this wiki and intends to give back during his journey.

== Itches ==

* Finish descriptions on all my pages.
* Post my Twitter and Facebook archives.
* Automate synchronization of notes.
* Clean up tags, particularly from Mastodon archives.
