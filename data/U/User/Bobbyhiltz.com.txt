== About my site ==
Hello. My name is {{bbbhltz}}. I'm from Nova Scotia, Canada. I've been a professor in France since 2006.

My site is a personal blog for sharing my interests in technology and education. It is made with [[Hugo]], hosted on [[Codeberg_Pages]], and the domain is registered through [https://www.infomaniak.com/goto/en/home?utm_term=67af344eb9273 Infomaniak].

While I have known about the IndieWeb for some time, as of March 2025 my site has only recently been "IndieWebified." There is still work to be done.

=== Work in Progress ===
* <del>adding different microformats, like [[h-feed]].</del>

== Itches ==
* something something webmentions???
* create bookmark page on site
* make site multilingual
