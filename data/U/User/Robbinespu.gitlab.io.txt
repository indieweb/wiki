== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Robbi Nespu Mohamad, you can just call me Rob or Robbi. As IT person, I love to explore (and break thing ðŸ”¨).

== Websites ==
My primary site ([http://robbinespu.gitlab.io http://robbinespu.gitlab.io]) is powered by [[Hugo]] static site generator.

= Think about it =
Hey, have you ever thouht about deleting your old content? Especially on centralize social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and many more.. which we are well aware that they will track, analyze and use your personal content (and metadata inside) for a certain purpose that only benefit for them self only.

Social network is not likely same as when you start register on they website. This is what you should expect anyway. They put you on free trial mode and let you lurk around and catch you connection, likes, post and more. After a certain period, you won't notice they does not care much about us connecting with friends, it just want us to consume content as much as possible on their platform - while generating ad revenue. No matter what social media you use, they want you to be addict to they social network.

Lucky enough, now we have decentralize / interconnected social media such as Mastodon, PixelFed,  Diaspora, Friendica and more as alternative. But will you spent some money for this (hosting, domain, storage etc)? or you will use public instance that available for you? But what happen if they taking down services suddenly? Take you time and think about it.

TLDR; Indieweb have potential as solution on what I said above. That why I take a part to explore, involve and contribute to it.
