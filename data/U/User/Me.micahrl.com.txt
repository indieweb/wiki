== Itches ==

* Owning my own infrastructure. Even if I do let plenty of services host it for me, I never get so tied into them that I can't take it back myself.
* Hosting my own content, or being annoyed that I don't (lol Twitter).

== Working on==

* [https://me.micahrl.com/projects/interpersonal Interpersonal], an [[IndieAuth]] endpoint and maybe in the future a [[Micropub]] server that commits to GitHub on the backend
* Probably getting distracted and starting some new [https://me.micahrl.com/projects/ project]
