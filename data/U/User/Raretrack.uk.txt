Hi, I'm <span class="h-card">[https://raretrack.uk/ Rob]</span>. I'm a big believer in the concepts behind the indieweb movement, particularly in owning and controlling your own data. I got interested when [[User:Kevinmarks.com|Kevin Marks]] talked about it on [https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google/episodes/266 TWiG (This Week in Google)] on 11 September 2014. 

Silos are attractive and entice you as they tend to work out of the box. So I'm here to find alternatives so I don't give in to temptation... :)

Although I'm tech-savvy and can do basic (excuse the pun!) HTML, CSS, VBA and VB.NET, when it comes to indieweb I'm really an end-user and feel very much like a newbie.
