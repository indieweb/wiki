== Introduction ==

Hello. I'm Vincent Pickering a Service Designer from the UK, based in Wellington, New Zealand .
I've been working in the industry for nearly 20 years building websites at scale.
I love pulling apart complex things and working out new ways to view or combine them.

== My site ==

My site is a static site built on [https://www.11ty.dev/]. The code is hosted on [https://github.com/vipickering/vincentp Github] and deployed to [https://www.netlify.com Netlify]. IndieWeb content is managed via Microservices built on Node.JS which are hosted on [https://heroku.com Heroku]

[https://github.com/vipickering/mastr-cntrl] - The Micropub Service
[https://github.com/vipickering/mc-syndication] - Syndication Service
[https://github.com/vipickering/mc-webmention] - Webmention Service

'''Content'''
The basic model to update content is to push in to the Github API. This triggers Netlify to build and deploy the site. At that point a variety of things can happen.

'''Receiving Webmentions''' 
Webmention.io posts to the Micropub service. Webmentions are formatted and posted in to a JSON file via the Github API. This triggers a rebuild on Netlify and displays the webmentions.

'''Sending Webmentions''' 
On publish I create an RSS feed of source/target pairs to send. The Webmention service checks this feed periodically for new items and when found passes them to Telegraph for sending.

'''Syndication'''
On publish I create an RSS feed of syndication items. The Syndication service checks this feed periodically for new items and when found Sends them to the relevant targets.

'''PESOS/Micropub''' 
Content from other sites such as ownyourswarm and all Micropub types are supported. Content is directed to my micropub service where content is formatted in to a markdown file and pushed in to the Github API.

'''Media Endpoint'''
Uploading images when using Micropub works by uploading images in to the Github API and passing back the URL location.
