== Introduction ==

Hello. I'm Vincent Pickering a Service Designer & UI/UX Consultant, based in the U.K
I've been working in the industry for nearly 20 years building websites at scale.
I love pulling apart complex things and working out new ways to view or combine them.

== My site ==

My site is a static site built on [https://jekyllrb.com Jekyll]. The code is hosted on [https://github.com/vipickering/vincentp Github] and deployed to [https://www.netlify.com Netlify]. IndieWeb content such as Webmentions are managed via a custom Node.JS server called [https://github.com/vipickering/mastr-cntrl Mastr Cntrl] which is hosted on [https://heroku.com Heroku]. In the future I may port this to Lamda functions and remove the dependancy on Heroku.

'''Content'''
The basic model to update content is to push in to the Github API. This triggers Netlify to build and deploy the site. At that point a variety of things can happen.

'''Receiving Webmentions''' 
Webmention.io posts to Mastr Cntrl. Webmentions are formatted and posted in to a JSON file via the Github API. This triggers a rebuild on Netlify and displays the webmentions.

'''Sending Webmentions''' 
On publish I create a temporary queue of source/target pairs to send. Publishing fires a webhook which makes Mastr-Cntrl get the feed and loop through sending each Webmention.

'''Syndication'''
Working on it.

'''PESOS/Micropub''' 
Content from other sites such as ownyourswarm and all Micropub types are supported. Content hits my micropub endpoint on Mastr Cntrl where content is formatted in to a markdown file and pushed in to the Github API.

'''Media Endpoint'''
Uploading images when using Micropub works by uploading images in to the Github API and passing back the URL location.

== Working On ==

* Syndicating content from the website. (documented here https://github.com/vipickering/mastr-cntrl/issues/23).
* Syndicate to other sites without minor Zapier dependancy.
* Rollup Bookmarks in to a feed or weekly newsletter.
* Accept Last.FM content and format in a nice way.
* Port Mastr Cntrl to Lamda functions. In theory this is possible and would reduce the amount of hosting involved.
* Porting static Jekyll website to 11ty.
* Supporting h-review
* Supporting delete webmention
* Supporting Direct Messages
* Social Reader integration
