{{xtof}} French speaking. Paris. 

Static experimentations on https://christopheducamp.com (powered by [[Hugo]]). Focused on UI.

=== Mastodon experiment ===

==== Mission statement ====
description to be written in French with the help of the indieweb community. 

Inspired by the MotherWiki of Alex Schroeder. 
Itching around "Encourage users to leave the instance and get their domains."

Warning added : 

* No confusion with indieweb.org 

No planning, no roadmap.

To be tested w/ the help of Hugo (masto.host)

* indielogin with my indieweb.me/@xtof URL. Connexion but no access in writing.
* webmention implementation 
* social pages : welcome visitor, [[now]] page will be written in french on my personal family wiki powered by mediawiki and linked via interwiki.


Thanks.
