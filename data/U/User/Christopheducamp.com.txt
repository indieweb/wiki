{{xtof}} French speaking. Paris. 

Static experimentations on https://christopheducamp.com (powered by [[Hugo]]). Focused on UI.


Non developer, currently (2018-03) exploring some architecture : Gandi (domain registrar), GitHub (repo) + Netifly [[CDN]].


== Project 2018 == 
* Family domain : http://ducamp.me (still planning a family experimentation wikihub - one subdomain for each of my children <firstname>.ducamp.me
** [[selfdogfood]]ing on https://christophe.ducamp.me (jamstack exploration with the help of jamstatic french community - https://jamstatic.fr/)
** http://microblog.ducamp.me/ powered by [[micro.blog]]

* https://indieweb.me a domain dedicated to test [[mastodon]]'s admin UI. Domain at Gandi + hosting in Portugal (by Hugo) on https://masto.host (5 euros/moinths). Opened to all indieweb members. 
Ready to share the administration. Drop me a toot on @xtof@indieweb.me 

Just tested indielogin with my indieweb.me/@xtof URL. Connexion but no access in writing.
