= Arne Govaerts AKA Q4.re =
Formaly know as tglo.be, I switch my domain name to <a href="https://q4.re">q4.re</a> in May 2019, mostly to make it more rememberable and easier to share. I am a Applied CS student and indiehacker.

== Stack ==
In July 2020 I moved to a [[Known]] based blog. Mostly because I just like rebuilding my blog more than blogging. (as of [https://q4.re/2020/07/for-some-reason-i-find-it-more 2020-07-21]).

Previously, I used a ssg written in .NET Core and a ssg made up of a few scripts (PHP, wget, rclone).
