= Arne Govaerts AKA Q4.re =
Formaly know as tglo.be, I switch my domain name to <a href="https://q4.re">q4.re</a> in May 2019, mostly to make it more rememberable and easier to share. At the same time, I swith from a semi-static website to a very simple homemade CMS, still written in PHP, still called Nordheim.

== Stack ==
In short: Nordheim + <a href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/">IndieAuth Token Endpoint</a> + [[selfauth]] + [[AWStats]] (needs replacement) + custom analytics script (needs good name)

Longer version: Nordheim is now a small scale flat-file CMS written in PHP. The individual entries are saved as html fragments. Routing is done by [https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute FastRoute], except for selfauth.

At the moment I use [https://www.gandi.net/en Gandi] as registar and DNS server, and [https://www.vimexx.nl/ Vimexx] as web hosting.

== Itches ==
* implement Micropub;
* syndicate to the fediverse and newsletter;
* own token endpoint;
* add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site;
* work further on my source available license;
* analytics : Making my own analytics tool (already active on [https://stat.q4.re/q4.re my personal website]) under the working title ''Arnold Analytics''.
