= Arne Govaerts AKA Q4.re =
Formaly know as tglo.be, I switch my domain name to <a href="https://q4.re">q4.re</a> in May 2019, mostly to make it more rememberable and easier to share. At the same time, I swith from a semi-static website to a very simple homemade CMS, still written in PHP, still called Nordheim. Now fully static, still called Nordheim, now written in .Net Core.

== Stack ==
In short: Nordheim + [[indieauth.com]] as indieauth and token endpoint + [https://usearnold.com Arnold Analytics] (selfdogfooding for the win) + [https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html BackBlaze] for storage + [https://bunnycdn.com/ BunnyCDN]

Longer version: Previously written in PHP, Nordheim is now transformed into a CLI application written in .NET Core and build on top of [https://www.vim.org/ Vim] and the Backblaze B2 API.
 
At the moment I use [https://www.gandi.net/en Gandi] as registar and DNS server, Backblaze B2 as storage and BunnyCDN as CDN.

== Itches ==
* syndicate to the fediverse and newsletter;
* add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site;

== Analytics ==
As I couldnâ€™t find a good fit with existing analytics tools, I just made my own: [https://usearnold.com Arnold Analytics].
