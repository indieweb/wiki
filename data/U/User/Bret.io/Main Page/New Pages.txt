== New pages ==

I think that these could be broken off into new pages or put into the sidebar.

=== Things for the sidebar ===
* [[to-do]] - next steps for IndieWebCamp and indie web efforts.
* [[issues]] - any problems with the wiki, the website, or anything else to do with IndieWebCamp
* Links to translations or language flags?

=== List of Guides ===
{{#categorytree:how|mode=pages|hideprefix=always|hideroot=on}}

=== Notable Projects ===
I think it would be nice to have a list websites that showcase notable IndieWeb projects.  Maybe eventually we could determine the list based on their IndieMark Score.  This page would be primarily for newcomers trying to get a feel for what projects best embody the IndieWeb principals by going through a list of links to examples.

This page is about how to promote IndieWeb ideas, and resources that can help you do that.
* [[buttons]] - buttons and badges to show your support on your website
* Indieweb hashtags: #indieweb #indieauth #ownyourdata etc...
* [[elsewhere]] - indieweb and indiewebcamp related news, communities, content on other sites

=== Important articles ===
A page with a list of distinguished articles:
* [[social web map]]
* [[problems]] - problems the indiewebcamp community are working individually and collectively to solve
* [[principles]]
* [[why]]
* [[projects]]
* [[anti-patterns]]
* [[POSSE]]
* [[Distinguishing]]
* ...

=== Distinguishing ===
The IndieWeb shares many of its principles with other efforts/communities, yet there are some key aspects that distinguish the IndieWeb from previous efforts.
* '''[[Principles]] over project-centrism.''' There are many similar efforts that are based on a single (often open source) project. We believe a community developing a plurality of [[projects]] following a set of [[principles]] is more robust and produces better results than any such [[monoculture]].
* '''[[Selfdogfood]].''' The best way to figure out what's most important, and actually build it, is to scratch your own itch, by [[creating]] for and on your personal domain, and iterating.
* '''[[Design]] and UX first, formats/protocols second.''' We focus on UX first, and then as we figure that out we re-use/subset/implement/iterate/develop the absolutely simplest most minimal formats &amp; protocols necessary to support that UX.
