=== Albums ===

Albums can be created with 3 different privacy levels (private, unlisted, and public) and 4 location privacy levels (full location, city, region, no location). Images uploaded have their dimensions saved and are queued for further processing (extracting location metadata and changing it for the publicly served image files). Weather data for the date and time of each image is fetched from Vaisala Xweather along with radar shown on the map.
