I'm a web developer with an interest in integrations, chatbots, open source apps, and semantic wikis. I'm currently working on [[https://resources.co/ Resources.co]], an Open Source startup for working with data and APIs.

You can find me on my own site, [[http://benatkin.com/ benatkin.com]], which has links to other places where I hang out online. Some of my work is on github where I'm [[https://github.com/benatkin benatkin]].
