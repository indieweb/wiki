I'm a web developer with an interest in semantic wikis. I'm currently working on some parts of a semantic wiki system.

You can find me on my own site, [[http://benatkin.com/ benatkin.com]], which has links to other places where I hang out online. Some of my work is on github where I'm [[https://github.com/benatkin benatkin]].
