I'm a web developer with an interest in integrations, chatbots, open source apps, and semantic wikis. I'm currently working on some [[https://github.com/resources/snippets snippets]] for integrations, some [[https://github.com/resources/walkthroughs walkthroughs]] for deploying open source apps, and [[https://github.com/benatkin/bork a tool for making API requests]].

You can find me on my own site, [[http://benatkin.com/ benatkin.com]], which has links to other places where I hang out online. Some of my work is on github where I'm [[https://github.com/benatkin benatkin]].
