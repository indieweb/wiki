== My IndieWeb setup ==

I have have two IndieWeb [[domains]], one is my personal homepage, the other one is my blog.

Until recently, both used [[Hugo]] as a [[static site generator]] with a [https://git.jlel.se/jlelse/Indiego handcrafted theme]. To publish on the go, I created a [[Micropub]]-endpoint in Go. Using another custom tool called [https://git.jlel.se/jlelse/jsonpub jsonpub] people could follow the blog using [[ActivityPub]].

Since November 2020, I use [https://jlelse.blog/posts/new-blog-goblog a CMS I built on my own] for my blog. I did this to replace the complex and probably over-engineered setup around Hugo with something more simple. The CMS still has all the functionality (and even more) that my previous setup had.
