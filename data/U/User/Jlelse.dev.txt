== My IndieWeb setup ==

I have have two IndieWeb [[domains]], one is my personal homepage, the other one is my blog. Both use [[Hugo]] as a [[static site generator]] with a [https://codeberg.org/jlelse/Indieroad handcrafted theme]. To publish on the go, I have written a [[Micropub]]-endpoint in Go ([https://jlelse.blog/posts/hugo-micropub/ post about it]). People can also follow me via [[ActivityPub]] ([https://jlelse.blog/micro/2020/02/2020-02-07-jvwap/ announcement]). For that I built myself a [https://codeberg.org/jlelse/jsonpub custom implementation] that sends [[JSON Feed]] updates to followers.
