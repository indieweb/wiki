'''<dfn>BYFOB</dfn>''' (Bring Your FOB[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_operating_base][https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fob], a corruption of Bring Your Own Front Backend) aka '''<dfn>S4</dfn>'''.

Benefits:

* HTTP anywhere
* full user autonomy
* continuity of identity
* minimizes preflight chatter for cross-origin requests
* open opportunity for implementing strong/powerful [[OCap]]-based security, as a fix for the Web's default origin-based security
* cheap as hell

Also:

* "Ownauth"
* "WIRe / WebID Remix"
* "service delegates"
* "endos"

consider hardware versus software.

hardware:

* high upfront cost (for design and manufacture) and expensive/impossible to change

software:

* comparatively lower upfront cost and cheaper/easier to change, provided that the hardware exposes a reasonable abstraction to build on

how is this relevant?

software isn't necessarily *that* easy to change; it's not the easiest thing in the world to make a site's backend support a new standard, for exampleâ€”even in the case that some third-party implementaion exists, the gluing process can be difficult, depending on a number of factors.  some really just stupidly easy examples: (a) compare adding adding a link in markup to adding a link header, (b) integrating OAuth into an existing site, or even more simply (c) the crapshoot that is support for user control over .well-known

use case: [[Solid]]-like services for static sites and "ownauth". NB: doesn't actually have to actually be rooted in Solid, esp. since Solid has yet to materialize.  we're going for "gestalt" here.
