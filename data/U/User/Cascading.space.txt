The plan is to do a site rebuild each year, allowing myself a month to complete. This gives me a deadline it has to be done by, and helps me focus the rest of the year on making things to put online. I don't want to be the fellow that spends all their time fixing and polishing a car, and never actually driving it.

== Cascading Space Itches ==
* Set up different [https://indieweb.org/Category:PostType post types]
* Store more content locally in the repo, instead of fully polling APIs on every rebuild
* Make an extension/[[bookmarklet]]/workflow to [[like]] a page in one action
** Similar for [[repost|reposts]], [[reply|replies]], etc
