I'm Khleedril.  I wrote my first (personal) website in 1993 entirely from scratch, and maintained it in that state ever since.  I'll happily suffer CSS, HTML, HTTP and Ecmascript on the front, though I utterly revile frameworks and Java; in the middle I've historically done everything in C++ but these days happily code in Rust and Guile when I need the run-time dexterity, and utterly revile Java, Python, Perl, NodeJS there; on the back-end always MySQL.

My main claim to fame is that I am the creator of Gnu Mcron, though that project is no longer in my control.

== My site ==
My work is distributed through my site [https://khleedril.org/dmbcs], though it still needs some re-organization to properly reflect the current state of affairs.
