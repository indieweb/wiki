I run [https://cleberg.net cleberg.net], a personal site, digital garden, and blog. While it was historically a blog, it has grown to include indie pages, such as:
* [https://cleberg.net/now/ /now]: What's I'm doing '''now'''.
* [https://cleberg.net/now/ /uses]: What I use for my website + my personal devices.
* [https://cleberg.net/now/ /services]: Services I host for the community to use!

I enjoy digital sovereignty, privacy, security, and a return to an independent web owned by its users and full of custom user content. I also tend to write a lot about Emacs, terminal-based applications and workflows, and self-hosting services to free yourself from SaaS companies.

I've been a part of many different indie web communities (Tileverse, SDF, Midnight Pub, 1MB Club, Gemini Protocol, etc.), but tend to drift in and out of these, so shoot me an email if you want to stay in touch.
