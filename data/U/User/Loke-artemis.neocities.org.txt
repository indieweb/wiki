Hi! I'm {{Loke}}, a newbie trying to learn

== About ==
Born on 1998 they counts as one of the early GenZ.<br>
Loke learned some [[HTML]] because some English homework talked about it and proceed to created the most horrible [[Tumblr]] site ever imagined (With weird custom cursors and MCR music blasting the moment you enter).<br>

== Web ==
Loke's blog is [https://loke-artemis.neocities.org/ loke-artemis.neocities.org].<br>
It's made on [[Neocities]] with [[Zonelets]] and is trying to implement [[zoneRSS]] to get an [[RSS feed]]. He's also using [[Figma]] to prototype the place but until that is completed the place appearance is based on one of the [[Zonelets]] basic themes.

== Computer skills ==
* Code (Loke searches most of it on the internet)
* Adobe (Tutorials for the win)
* IDK They just try to do things and then forgets how he did them

== Offline skills ==
* Doodles
* Fanzines
* Comics
* Embroidery
* Cross stitch
* Crochet
