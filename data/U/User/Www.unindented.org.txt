Hi, I'm {{unindented}}! I'm a software engineer currently working at Microsoft. I'm originally from Madrid, I lived in London for a while, and now I'm based in Seattle.

'''''Fun fact''': In Spanish cultures, people tend to have two surnames. The first is the paternal surname — the father's first surname — and the second is the maternal surname — the mother's first surname. So Perez is not my middle name, it's my first surname!''
