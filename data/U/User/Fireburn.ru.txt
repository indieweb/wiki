Hello. I'm Vika. This is my wiki page. I don't really know what to write here.

== Website ==
My CMS is [https://gitlab.com/kittybox/kittybox Kittybox] - a blazing-fast IndieWeb suite that's a work in progress. Currently the basic features work, supplemented by some hosted services.

* [[IndieAuth]]: WIP
** Would be independent from a website
** Will support multiple websites (a-la indieauth.com)
** Will have several authentication methods
*** Password
*** WebAuthn (YubiKey)
*** Notification to a supported phone (maybe)
* [[Webmentions]]: WIP
** Will update the Micropub source with webmentions, archiving them in process for display
** The frontend will be responsible for rendering everything
** Original links will be preserved so that I can use Salmention
* [[Microsub]]: [[Aperture]] (for now)


=== Itches ===
==== Working on ====
* ?q=food in Micropub
** shows a list of food in h-food format (done)
** Perfect for creating a food diary
** Filtering by date and post types (or creating a separate feed) allows to count caloric intake (if nutritional values are specified)

==== Not working on yet ====
* Aperture instance saves only last 7 days of posts (maybe implement my own Microsub server?)
* No comment form for people without IndieWeb-enabled sites (use commentpara.de for providing pseudonymous/anonymous identities, but beware of spam)
* No [[PuSH]] support (pyindieblog-micropub pinged switchboard in the old version, I need to reimplement that!)
* Search - may be done differently:
** Server-side search (may be faster, but harder to implement, may require database support or building a separate index)
** Reuse lunr.js from static site and build index dynamically (requires JS and still some server-side work - publish an index of posts)
** Indexing may be taken care of by a separate service, same as feed processing
* Implement [[salmention]]
** Client-side support is already there in Blogblaze, but there's no webmention endpoint to accept salmentions
** Also does Kittybox send webmentions on updates? it should do that according to the spec
* Make Webmentions static
** Webmention endpoint should update Micropub content on each webmention
** Possibility of conflicts while editing
*** Can be solved with locks on MF2 objects in the database
*** Or just by making all edits atomic

==== Solved ====
* Micropub is slow
* Almost nobody reads me ([[syndication]] supported to various services via [[Webmention]] and potentially [[bridgy]])
* Check-in support
** Kittybox's Micropub component stores arbitrary MF2-JSON blobs
** Renderer component takes posts and renders every property it knows about
** currently it renders check-ins too
** Form-encoded posts may be a problem; they need to be special-cased sometimes
* the name "pyindieblog" is too technical and isn't cute enough - so it's Kittybox

=== Plans and possibilities ===
* Make a calendar from an h-feed of h-events (posted directly or reposted on a reply with RSVP)
* Make a private gallery from a media endpoint
