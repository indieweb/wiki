Hello. I'm Vika. This is my wiki page. I don't really know what to write here.

== Kittybox ==
[https://sr.ht/~vikanezrimaya/kittybox Kittybox] is a blazing-fast all-in-one website management platform. It's written in Rust and supports a lot of IndieWeb features (or at least will support once I manage to write those features).

* Basic MF2 markup: works, template system is used to generate HTML
* [[Micropub]]: Full support, including media endpoint uploads
** Implementing extensions is planned, but not on the roadmap yet
* [[IndieAuth]]: WIP
** Currently using [[IndieAuth.com]] as a temporary measure while implementing an in-house solution
** Will use WebAuthn as primary authentication method
** Passwords will be explicitly unsupported
* [[Webmentions]]: WIP
** Will update the Micropub source with webmentions, archiving them in process for display
** The frontend will be responsible for rendering everything
** Original links will be preserved so that I can use Salmention
* [[Microsub]]: WIP
** Haven't started working on it yet

=== Itches ===
Itches, confirmed plans and other things for Kittybox are tracked on the [https://todo.sr.ht/~vikanezrimaya/kittybox Kittybox issue tracker].

=== Concepts and ideas ===
* Make a calendar from an h-feed of h-events (posted directly or reposted on a reply with RSVP)
* Media endpoint that doubles as a private gallery
** Media endpoint should keep track of uploaded blobs
** Blobs should be presented in the UI in reverse-chronological order
** Danbooru-like tagging of media blobs for quick filtering and retrieval
*** Geographic tagging (extracted from EXIF data or added manually)
*** Categories (manually assigned - don't have resources for using ML nor am excited about ML in general)
*** alt-text management (post creation could automatically suggest inserting pre-configured alt-text into <code>u-photo</code>)
** Auto-upload photos from phone's Camera Roll via companion app
* Food and recipe collection
** Kittybox's backend doesn't really care what gets stuffed inside it, as long as it's proper MF2-JSON
** The frontend needs to be updated to gain support for rendering recipes
** <code>?q=food</code> support in Micropub to quickly reference food items when creating posts
** A recipe book on the website
** Interactive measurement adjustments (double all measures, convert metric to <s>inferior</s> Imperial units)
