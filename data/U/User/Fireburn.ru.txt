Hello. I'm Vika. This is my wiki page. I don't really know what to write here.

== Website ==
My CMS is [https://gitlab.com/kisik21/pyindieweb pyindieweb] (considering renaming it to pyindieblog since it sounds more cute) which is written by me with Python and Flask.

* [[IndieAuth]]: [[indieauth.com]] (incl. tokens)
* [[Webmentions]]: [[webmention.io]] w/ JS shim for displaying webmentions
* [[Microsub]]: [[Aperture]], reading via [[Together]] and [[Indigenous]] for Android
* [[Micropub]]: Included in pyindieblog
=== Itches ===
==== Working on ====

==== Not working on yet ====
* Aperture instance saves only last 7 days of posts (maybe implement my own Microsub server?)
* No comment form for people without IndieWeb-enabled sites (use commentpara.de for providing pseudonymous/anonymous identities, but beware of spam)

* Search - may be done differently:
** Server-side search (may be faster, but harder to implement)
** Reuse lunr.js from static site and build index dynamically (requires JS and still some server-side work)

==== Solved ====
* Micropub is slow (solved with advent of Flask IndieWeb API written by me)
* Almost nobody reads me ([[syndication]] supported to various services via [[Webmention]] and potentially [[bridgy]])
* No [[PuSH]] support (pyindieblog micropub pings switchboard for main page, typed feed and tag feeds)

=== Plans and possibilities ===
* Make Webmentions static
* Implement [[salmention]]
* Check-in support (pyindieblog technically supports ANY kind of posts, the bottleneck is only the frontend)
