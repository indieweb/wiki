Hello. I'm Vika. This is my wiki page. I don't really know what to write here.

== Website ==
My CMS is [https://gitlab.com/vikanezrimaya/kittybox Kittybox] - a blazing-fast IndieWeb suite that's a work in progress. It's not even deployed yet!

* [[IndieAuth]]: [[indieauth.com]] (incl. tokens), planning on rolling out my own with WebAuthn
* [[Webmentions]]: [[webmention.io]] w/ JS shim for displaying webmentions (the last one is currently defunct), planning on rolling out my own
* [[Microsub]]: [[Aperture]], reading via [[Indigenous]] for Android, planning to deploy [[Ekster]] maybe?
* [[Micropub]]: kittybox-micropub

=== Itches ===
==== Working on ====

==== Not working on yet ====
* Aperture instance saves only last 7 days of posts (maybe implement my own Microsub server?)
* No comment form for people without IndieWeb-enabled sites (use commentpara.de for providing pseudonymous/anonymous identities, but beware of spam)
* No [[PuSH]] support (pyindieblog-micropub pinged switchboard in the old version, I need to reimplement that!)
* Search - may be done differently:
** Server-side search (may be faster, but harder to implement - requires a good database, maybe Couch or Mongo?)
** Reuse lunr.js from static site and build index dynamically (requires JS and still some server-side work - publish an index of posts)

==== Solved ====
* Micropub is slow (solved with advent of Flask IndieWeb API written by me)
* Almost nobody reads me ([[syndication]] supported to various services via [[Webmention]] and potentially [[bridgy]])
* Check-in support
** pyindieblog-micropub stores arbitrary MF2-JSON blobs
** Renderer takes posts and renders every property it knows about
** currently it can be taught to render check-ins too
** Form-encoded posts may be a problem; they need to be special-cased sometimes
* the name "pyindieblog" is too technical and isn't cute enough - so it's Kittybox

=== Plans and possibilities ===
* Make Webmentions static
* Implement [[salmention]]
