Hello. I'm Vika. This is my wiki page. I don't really know what to write here.

== Website ==
Currently my setup is static site built with Hugo and dynamic components in Python and some external services.

* [[IndieAuth]]: [[indieauth.com]] (incl. tokens)
* [[Webmentions]]: [[webmention.io]] w/ JS shim for displaying webmentions
* [[Microsub]]: [[Aperture]], reading via [[Monocle]] and [[Indigenous]] for Android
* [[Micropub]]: Python CGI script (not open-source since I'm rewriting it in Flask)

=== Itches ===
==== Working on ====
* Micropub is slow (will be solved with upcoming Flask rewrite that is planned to be open source)
==== Not working on yet ====
* Aperture instance saves only last 7 days of posts (maybe implement my own Microsub server?)
* No comment form for people without IndieWeb-enabled sites (use commentpara.de for providing pseudonymous/anonymous identities, but beware of spam)
* Almost nobody reads me ([[POSSE]] to different services, such as indieweb.xyz)
* No [[PuSH]] support (use [[superfeedr]] for that)

=== Plans and possibilities ===
I'm currently considering to maybe make my site dynamically-generated with Flask. This will make it more accessible to people with JS disabled (since I can render webmentions server-side) and will make me more independent from someone's services' failures (not that I don't trust people who run these services to not run an upgrade of something in the middle of night and ruin the service).
