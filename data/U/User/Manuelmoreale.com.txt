For the past 10+ years I worked as a fulltime freelance website designer and developer. These days I'm more a developer than a designer but I still love messing with typography and design.

== My blog ==

Since 2017 I posted content on my personal blog, [https://manuelmoreale.com manuelmoreale.com] where I write about pretty much everything I find interesting but I think the content is going to become weirder and weirder over time becuase that's how websites are supposed to be: weird.

== Other stuff ==

* I interview people with blogs for my very creatively named newsletter [https://peopleandblogs.com People and Blogs].
* I run a minimalism focused digital magazine called [https://minimalissimo.com Minimalissimo].
* I collect quirky websites for [https://theforest.link theforest.link]
