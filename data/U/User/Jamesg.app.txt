== About Me ==

By day, I am the Technical Content Manager at Career Karma. In my spare time, I like to read about sustainability and the internet. I've been fascinated by owning my own data for a while. I set up jamesg.app in 2019 as my internet home. Initially, I hosted on other platforms; WordPress and later Squarespace. I am now hosting my own static website using Jekyll.

I came across the IndieWeb in late 2019 and have just came back to explore the topic. I'm especially interested in taking more control over my data and seeing how I can syndicate data I create across different platforms.
