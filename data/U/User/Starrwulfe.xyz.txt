===== Bio =====
Husband, Father, Teacher, Journalist. Tokyoite, Atlantan, Afro-American. Globetrotter, Homebody. Storyteller, Story-Listener. Historian, Futurist. Striving to leave the world better than I found it. 📰📸👩🏾‍💻🎶🌆 STL→ATL→TKO →ATL 
===== About =====
🌏 I have traveled back and forth to Japan for about 20 years now-- been fascinated with this place since I was a child, and if you ask me why-- honestly, I couldn't really explain. I've also done brief stints in Taiwan and Singapore too.

🏢 Professionally I am a part time journalist primarily covering East Asia and the tech sectors, and have worked in TV, film, print, radio, and multimedia/web since...well before DSL and WiFi! I love working with video and multimedia as a producer the most, but I'm happy doing anything in the New Media realm. I was a teacher of English and Mass Communication at a large private school in Tokyo, A full-time International News Editor for a large Asian media conglomerate and worked as a freelancer based in Tokyo from time to time.

🏡These days I'm no longer full time in Asia; I moved back to Atlanta, GA where my current day job is as a cloud support engineer for a big software company that is probably running the OS in your computer. ...The PCs that don't have a fruit or cold weather loving flightless bird repping them anyway. 😉

===== Projects & Itches: =====

* Trying to make the best internet hub for myself in the form of getting starrwulfe.xyz "indi-fied" as well as organized.

# This means making sure functionality as well as taxonomy and appearance is representative of myself; it is my home on the internet after all.
# Also includes talking to some of the fine folks in this community and yoinking some of their ideas and making them fit my own style. Never reinvent the wheel when someone has already gotten an airplane off the ground!
# Use it, break it, fix it, use it more, break it more, fix it m... you get the idea.

* Figure out a way to post pictures (and video) to my site and have it automatically upload to my Pixelfed instance. Bonus points for using IFTTT to get it into FB/Insta. I already have it set up to go from Insta to twitter and FB but I think I tried this years ago and it didn't work. Maybe set up an [[OwnYourGrams]] instance
* Do check-ins better. And weather. [[David Shanske]] is the one to talk to about this maybe. 
* Get a more compact and minimalist layout going. I'd like it to look like [https://kandr3s.co/ Andres Cardenas's] site complete with my favorite terminal font. The density, compactness, and flow is just right to me. (Side note: I still may play with GoBlog again when I get more time, but for now I'm all in on Wordpress because I already understand it/can troubleshoot it.)
