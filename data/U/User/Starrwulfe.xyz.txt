===== About =====
🌏 I have traveled back and forth to Japan for about 20 years now-- been fascinated with this place since I was a child, and if you ask me why-- honestly, I couldn't really explain. I've also done brief stints in Taiwan and Singapore too.

🏢 Professionally I am a part time journalist primarily covering East Asia and the tech sectors, and have worked in TV, film, print, radio, and multimedia/web since...well before DSL and WiFi! I love working with video and multimedia as a producer the most, but I'm happy doing anything in the New Media realm. I was a teacher of English and Mass Communication at a large private school in Tokyo, A full-time International News Editor for a large Asian media conglomerate and worked as a freelancer based in Tokyo from time to time.

🏡These days I'm no longer full time in Asia; I moved back to Atlanta, GA where my current day job is as a cloud support engineer for a big software company that is probably running the OS in your computer. ...The PCs that don't have a fruit or cold weather loving flightless bird repping them anyway. 😉
