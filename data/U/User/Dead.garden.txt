I've always liked being on the computer and the small internet has become a big hobby for me recently! I've only been "self" hosting since about 2022 and had a few sites on [[NeoCities]] and various [[tildeverse|PubNIX]]es before that. I don't know much about programming and keep more to the low-tech side of things.

== My main site ==

[https://dead.garden Dead.garden] is my most active site, where I mostly blog or play around with web related technologies and ideas.

=== Technologies ===

My site is static and hand written for the most part, though the blog is generated using a personally adapted version of the [[static site generator]] [[bashblog]].

At the moment my site is served by [[Nginx]] and hosted on a [[VPS]] somewhere in the UK. I also have an [[radio|internet radio]] that uses icecast2 and ices.

My website uses some microformats and [[Webmention]]s are supported (and displayed using [[webmention.js]])

I used to have a CGI script that [[scrobble|displayed my current song on Spotify]] but that hasn't been working since some changes happened from Spotify's side. I hope I can bring it back some day.


== Other sites ==

=== [https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/diptera.casa gemini://brachycera.diptera.casa] ===
Before anything else I had a [[Gemini_protocol|gemini]] capsule. It still uses my old domain name "diptera.casa" and contains some more things and generally stuff I'd be less comfortable with sharing on the world wide web, where people are mean and bots are rampant.
diptera.casa/dead.garden are also available over the finger and gopher protocol.

=== josprojects.com ===

I'm currently using that domain to host private web-based software, such as [[feed reader|FreshRSS]] to aggregate blogs to read and a [[MediaWiki]] for school notes that I share with a few classmates who were interested. 

== IndieWeb things ==
Most weeks you might find me at the European time-zone [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/hwclondon Homebrew Website Club Meetings].

I write [https://dead.garden/blog/tag_indieweb.html blog posts] about the indieweb on occasion and I contribute to the wiki sometimes. I haven't made any cool software but my "biggest" contributions to the wiki so far were writing the [[Main_Page-de|German language homepage]] and making some [[buttons#88x31|88x31 IndieWeb buttons]].

==== Plans ====
I use [[bashblog]] to generate my blog and would like to fork the software with IndieWeb [[building blocks]] added, such as [[webmentions]] and [[microformats]]. My personal script is pretty pretty shitty so I should make a clean one and put it on [[github]] some day so other people can use it.
