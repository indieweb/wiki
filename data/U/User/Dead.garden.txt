I've always liked being on the computer and the small internet has become a big hobby for me recently! I've only been "self" hosting since about 2022 and had a few sites on [[NeoCities]] and various [[tildeverse|PubNIX]]es before that. I don't know much about programming and keep more to the low-tech side of things.

== My main site ==

[https://dead.garden Dead.garden] is my most active site, where I mostly blog or play around with web related technologies and ideas.

=== Technologies ===

My site is static and hand written for the most part, though the blog is generated using a personally adapted version of the static site generator [https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog bashblog].

At the moment my site is served by [[Nginx]] and hosted on a [[VPS]] somewhere in the UK. It uses some CGI scripts, such as the one that [[scrobble|displays my current song on Spotify]]. I also have an [[radio|internet radio]] that uses icecast2 and ices.

My website uses some microformats and [[Webmention]]s are supported (and displayed using [[webmention.js]])


== Other sites ==

=== [https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/diptera.casa gemini://brachycera.diptera.casa] ===
Before anything else I had a [[Gemini|gemini]] capsule. It still uses my old domain name "diptera.casa" and contains some more things and generally stuff I'd be less comfortable with sharing on the world wide web, where people are mean and bots are rampant.
diptera.casa/dead.garden are also available over the finger and gopher protocol.

=== https://josprojects.com ===
A site focused only on what I feel is my best art work. It mostly contains fanart because the things I like inspire me and I think about them.

== Indieweb things ==
Sometimes I write blog posts about the indieweb: https://dead.garden/blog/tag_indieweb.html and most weeks I'm at the European time-zone [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/hwclondon Homebrew Website Club Meetings].
