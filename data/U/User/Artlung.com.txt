I'm Joe Crawford. First website: 1996. First blog post: February 2001 and ongoing. I've been a web developer since 1997 or so. I was a member of the Web Standards Project. You might know me from [[San Diego]] IndieWeb Camp and from [[Front End Study Hall]]

== My site ==
I initially created my own site by hand, and integrated a blog using Blogger.com's FTP functionality. In 2005 I migrated all that over from Blogger to WordPress. In 2010 I wrote a piece on [http://artlung.com/blog/2010/03/02/migrating-an-old-blogger-blog-to-wordpress/ Migrating an old Blogger blog to WordPress] and have helped a lot of people with that quirky process.
