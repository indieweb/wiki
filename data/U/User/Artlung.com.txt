I'm Joe Crawford. First website: 1996. First blog post: February 2001 and ongoing. I've been a web developer since 1997 or so. I was a member of the Web Standards Project. You might know me from [[San Diego]] IndieWeb Camp and from [[Front End Study Hall]]

== My site: ArtLung.com ==
I created my own site [http://artlung.com/ artlung.com] in the 1990s by hand. Later I integrated a blog using Blogger.com's FTP functionality. In 2005 I migrated the blog from Blogger to WordPress. In 2010 I wrote ''[http://artlung.com/blog/2010/03/02/migrating-an-old-blogger-blog-to-wordpress/ Migrating an old Blogger blog to WordPress]''. Since then I've helped a number of people navigate the quirky process of moving blogs and websites.

== Elsewise ==

=== ArtLung Lab ===

[https://lab.artlung.com/ ArtLung Lab] is a site that grew from experiments on my website in the 1990s. It was my laboratory for learning web development. It grew larger than what fit on my site. I incorporated Disqus comments a few years after that. In 2024 I added [[webmention]] support, user-customizable theming, and rewrote and revamped most of it.
