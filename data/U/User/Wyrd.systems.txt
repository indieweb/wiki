Hello! My name is Matt and I live in Lewes just outside of Brighton in the UK.
I've dabbled around the edges of the IndieWeb for a while and have decided to go all-in as much as I can given my relatively scant technical knowledge.

Right now, as I type this, my site is just a flat html file with some rel=me links but hopefully soon I'll at least get a basic blog together using Python (the only coding language I have any useful knowledge of).


== Itches ==

* set up a simple site with Pelican
* set up a micro-blog (just a 'micro' category of normal posts, I guess) and POSSE to Twitter from there
* send a few webmentions
