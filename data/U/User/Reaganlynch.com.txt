This page is a work in progresss. You can see how my progress is going at [https://reaganlynch.com/ ReaganLynch.com], my personal website.

It is important to know that I"m Blind and as a result I do not usually think about adding pictures to my website.

== Itches ==

First time I've heard of this concept, and I am interested. Here are things I'm working on.

* Determine if I want to stay with self-hosted WordPress for my personal blog or if I want to move everything to micro.blog.
* Get back into writing on my own website.
* Learn more about H-Cards and how to add one on my website.
* Move tracking of my books and reading progress to my own website.
* Explore how to highlight and talk about small businesses and a unique way.

== Longterm Projects ==

* Build a website for finding a niche consultant.
