== Itches ==
* Drastic visual redesign of blog (how to put posts and micro.blogs on same page, in an appealing way?)
* Split prior years' posts (and maybe `/projects` and `seattle-2019`) into subdomains with separate repos, as they are basically fixed in time and don't need to be rebuilt all the time. PROS: better rebuild time on current SSR blog. CONS: breaks old URLs. (unless there's a redirect trick I can come up with. https://example.com/2018/01/01/happynewyear => https://2018.example.com/01/01/happynewyear ???)
