== Itches ==
* Drastic visual redesign of blog (how to put posts and micro.blogs on same page, in an appealing way?)
* Split prior years' posts (and maybe `/projects` and `seattle-2019`) into separate repos, so that they don't need to be rebuilt every time a new 2020 post goes up. (Tricky? Preserve URLs with redirects somehow?)
