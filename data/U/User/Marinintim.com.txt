== Current IndieWeb implementation ==

Static files on a [[Digital Ocean]] droplet.

WebMentions are supported using [[Webmention.io]],
[[backfeed]] through [[Bridgy]] and rendered on the clientside.

== Progress ==

* posting [[article | articles]] on my own website since 2016 (probably earlier too)
* posting [[note | notes]] on my own website since 2019
* posting [[event | events]] on my own website since 2019
* posting [[RSVP | RSVPs]] on my own website since 2019

== Stories (aka [[itches]]) ==

* I want to publish notes to my website from the web, to avoid installing software required for building the current version of website locally
* I want to [[PESOS]] check-ins from Swarm so I can control how check-in is displayed
* I want to see, whether anyone is reading my articles without lurking through access logs
* I want to share URLs as read-it-later bookmark on my website using Share menu on iOS device
* I want to reply to URLs, by using Share menu on iOS device
