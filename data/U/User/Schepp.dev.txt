== My personal itch ==
<div class="p-note">
Instead of hacking around with JS frameworks like almost every other frontend developer currently does, I work on traditional server-rendered, component-based systems, use bleeding-edge CSS, and keep a close eye on accessibility as well as the loading and runtime performance of a site. None of that stopped me from building my own client-side renderer, based on Twig.js, Web Workers, Redux, and MorphDOM.

When I’m not working for a client, I…

* co-organize the CSS Café
* help run the Webworker NRW Meetup
* contribute to the localhost conference and the Fronteers Conference
* and I co-host the Working Draft Podcast.
