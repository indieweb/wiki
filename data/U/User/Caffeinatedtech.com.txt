== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Glenn. I've been on the internet since at least 1993 or so. I started my first blog in 1999 by hand-coding the HTML using [https://evrsoft.com/1stpage2.shtml|1stPage 2000]. I then moved through various stages of: GreyMatter, Movable Type, Radio Userland and WordPress. I am also playing around with a few Hugo sites lately.

I was on the Indieweb a few years back under a different domain and then got busy with life. Now I'm back with a fresh domain and fresh enthusiasm for what the Indieweb stands for.
