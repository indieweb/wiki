I'm a programmer living in Colorado Springs, CO, USA. I've been writing code since the late 90s and I'm currently writing yet another iteration of my own blog software. It seemed like it'd be fun to integrate a bunch of IndieWeb functionality with it, and I've done a decent amount so far, but there's still ''so much'' left to do. I'll probably be back here pretty regularly ;-)
