If I continue to host vHWC, the regular Wednesday doesn't work anymore because of HWC Berlin.

Reference Time for me would be Europe/Berlin - times below link to timezone comparison sheets for the next date - summertime would change them tied to Berlin time.

Please leave +1/-1/0 votes at slots. If off-weeks would work better, note that too (Wednesday off-weeks is filled for me now with chaos-related events)
