Hi! My name is '''Massi''', and I am a non-IT person with a vanity website.

I wrote my first page in 1999 before I even got online, and I published it on my 17th birthday.

Since then I have had 7 different websites. A friend of mine calls me "the intermittent blogger".

My current site is titled '''[https://massimiliano.farinetti.eu/ Verba volant. Scripta manent. Virtualia?]''' (after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verba%20volant,%20scripta%20manent the Latin proverb]) and I think that I will stick with it for a long time.

I am [https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/ a weird dude who writes raw HTML] (and CSS) (and XML). I code using [[Atom#Other_Things_Called_Atom|Atom]] (RIP).

I apply the [[principles]] and technicalities of the IndieWeb to the best of my skills.

Ages ago I contributed (poorly) to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habari the Habari project].

The lowercase "f" in my username troubles me a little.

I do not have any social media profile.
