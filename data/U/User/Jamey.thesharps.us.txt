I built https://www.comic-rocket.com/ to meet my needs as a webcomic reader, and it's turned out to be useful to lots of other people.

I'm interested in enabling creators of webcomics and other serially-published work to use IndieWeb principles in their own publishing, while using open standards to enable people who read webcomics to use their preferred tools.

In other words, I want the podcasting experience but for comics and other media. Like in podcasting, RSS and Atom ''almost'' work as-is, but there are a bunch of pain points when you go to actually do it. I think these can be addressed with a combination of UX improvements in feed readers, and implementations of existing standards that have been overlooked.

I attended in Portland and hosted a small session on [[2018/serials]]. On demo day I opened these issues:
