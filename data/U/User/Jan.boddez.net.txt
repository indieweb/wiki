== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Jan, and I've been building websites since the early '00s, back when web standards and semantic markup first became a real thing. More recently, I created several IndieWeb-adjacent [https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress WordPress plugins], and a couple Laravel packages.

== My IndieWeb Setup ==
[https://jan.boddez.net/ My personal website] is powered by [[WordPress]] (and the [[IndieBlocks]] plugin). It supports IndieAuth and Micropub, by means of the excellent, well, [[WordPress IndieAuth Plugin|IndieAuth]] and [[Micropub for WordPress|Micropub]] plugins.

It runs a fairly bare-bones "block" (or "FSE") theme. My "microblog" lives at [https://jan.boddez.net/notes /notes].

I've been experimenting with separate "likes" and "listens" sections.

I used to regularly (and still occasionally) [[POSSE]] to my [https://indieweb.social/@janboddez Mastodon account], but have since added "native" [[WordPress ActivityPub plugin|ActivityPub]] support.

== Itches ==
Earlier this year, I moved a couple of my sites to a single WordPress multisite install, which now supports subdomains—handled automatically by [[Caddy]]—as well as "proper" domain name mapping. I'm hoping to one day open up registrations (for a select number of people, at least, as moderating user-generated content is not something I'm looking forward to).

Lastly, I'm still experimenting with the ActivityPub plugin (and my little [https://github.com/janboddez/addon-for-activitypub add-on plugin] for it).
