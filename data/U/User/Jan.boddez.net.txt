== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Jan, and I've been building websites since the early '00s, back when web standards and semantic markup first became a real thing. More recently, I created several IndieWeb-adjacent [https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress WordPress plugins], and a couple Laravel packages.

== My IndieWeb Setup ==
=== Laravel ===
[https://jan.boddez.net/ My personal website] is powered by F-Stop,<ref>"Coincidently," I once developed and ran a feed reader with the very same name. It is my goal to one day have a similar reader inside this CMS.</ref> a Laravel-based CMS. In essence, it's a rather simple setup (which I then added a form of theming and plugins to).

It currently supports ''most'' things my WordPress site had, too: "short-form" content types, Webmention, simple location and weather "detection," syndicating to Mastodon, and "shortlinks."

I've recently added IndieAuth and partial Micropub support.

<del>Might want to add ActivityPub one day, although I'm not sure running a different implementation—I used to use WordPress' ActivityPub plugin—from the same domain will work at all.</del> I have since enabled ActivityPub, and it sure looks to be working, although certain servers did take slightly longer to pick up the new URL structure.

=== Previously: WordPress ===
[https://jan.boddez.net/ My personal website] used to be powered by [[WordPress]] (and the [[IndieBlocks]] plugin). It supports IndieAuth and Micropub, by means of the excellent, well, [[WordPress IndieAuth Plugin|IndieAuth]] and [[Micropub for WordPress|Micropub]] plugins.

It runs a fairly bare-bones "block" (or "FSE") theme. IndieBlocks is able to automatically "inject" microformats2 into ''any'' block theme, so that's what I had it do. My "microblog" continues to live at [https://jan.boddez.net/notes /notes].

I'd been experimenting with separate "likes" and "listens" ("scrobbles") sections. The likes are still there; the listens are on hold for a bit.

I used to regularly [[POSSE]] to my [https://indieweb.social/@janboddez Mastodon account], but ended up relying on "native" [[WordPress ActivityPub plugin|ActivityPub]] more often.

I used to follow websites ''all inside WordPress' admin interface'', by way of another plugin of mine, [https://feedreader.site/ Feed Reader]. I'm hoping to soon integrate a reader into my new CMS.

=== Miscellaneous ===
I once wrote a feed reader which supported h-feed and Micropub, and had partial support for Microsub; it was called F-Stop, too. Prior to that, I'd developed a sort of "fork" of "Monocle," i.e., a pure (web-based) Microsub (and Micropub) ''client''. I ran it in combination with this Aperture fork of mine (and, later on, F-Stop).

== Itches ==
Earlier this year, I moved a couple of my sites to a single WordPress multisite install, which now supports subdomains—handled automatically by [[Caddy]]—as well as "proper" domain name mapping. I'm hoping to one day open up registrations (for a select number of people, at least, as moderating user-generated content is not something I'm looking forward to).

Lastly, I'm still experimenting with the ActivityPub plugin (and my little [https://github.com/janboddez/addon-for-activitypub add-on plugin] for it).
