Hello! I'm Charlie, the variously hyperactive, loud, "funny", drunk, angry, hideously depressed one.

== My site ==
I have had a serious problem with running websites, owning and discarding domain names like a drunk weasel. I've now settled on my current domain name. However in the last 8 years of owning it I have used probably every technology possible to publish and embarrassingly small number of blog posts. But stability has been achieved, and since late 2018 I have been using Drupal as a content store. I am also right now using it as a website. However I'm in the process of moving the website to using a staticky generated site, pulling data from my main Drupal data store as needed.
