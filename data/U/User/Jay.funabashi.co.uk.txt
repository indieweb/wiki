My website is https://jay.funabashi.co.uk/ I want it to be a life journal/archive.

My site is powered by software I am building called inari.

I have a ~10 year backlog of photos that I want to backfill so I am interested in making that process as seamless as possible.
This includes posting UI and ability to find things quickly
