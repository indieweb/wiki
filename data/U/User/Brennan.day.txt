* '''Open source when possible''' - Share knowledge, improve together
* '''Community over growth''' - Center marginalized voices and mutual aid

== IndieWeb Community ==
I've been an IndieWeb advocate since the early 2020s. I believe in:
* '''Mentorship without gatekeeping''' - actively supporting newcomers
* '''Pro bono work''' - providing web development for community organizations
