I started my first blog back in 2000, and since then I've written a good dozen custom blog engines. I mostly program in Python, but I also enjoy [https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/ Guile], and started my career as a webmaster using PHP. My [https://robida.net current blog] is 💞 [https://codeberg.org/robida/site open source] and still and early work in progress ~~ I do like to implement things from scratch so I can learn and understand how they work.

My main goal for the blog is to:

# Have a place to store my data. I've integrated it with Strava, my Withings smart scale, and my oura ring, so I can keep track of my health. I've also added an endpoint where I can upload a photo of what I eat, and have AI to determine the nutrional contents (calories, proteins, carbs, fat).
# Have a place to store my social interactions. I participate in [https://fawm.org FAWM], an yearly challenge to write 14 songs in February. The site gets wiped out every March, and I lose all the comments people have made on my songs. I'm planning to use [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]] to preserve these comments.
# Have a better way of consuming news, at my own pace, using my own algorithm. I've been using an RSS reader for a while, but I want to like and comment on things. So I implemented Microsub and Micropub on my blog, and I'm using IndiePass for Android to follow people and news, while being able to have a voice.

My blog is simple: it has one table where I store [[mf2json]] for everything. My h-card is there, my posts are there, the posts from feeds I follow get stored there. If I want to follow someone in I just posts a [[u-follow-of]], and my hourly cronjob will pick it up and fetch posts from that person, in addition to storing their h-card in the table.

I'm using [https://litestar.dev/ Litestar], a super clean Python web framework and [https://picocss.com/ PicoCSS], with plain Javascript. As much as I have mixed feelings about AI, I've been building the latest version of my blog with the help of Claude Code, which I use as a fancy autocomplete ~~ heavily constrained so it writes the code that I would write.
