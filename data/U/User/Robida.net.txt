Heya, I'm Beto!

I've been a long time fan of the IndieWeb, even before I knew it had a name. I started my first blog in 2000, and since then I've written a good dozen of custom blog engines. Lately I started working on a new version of website, not just a blog, but a place where I can manage my bookmarks, book backlog, shipments, and more.
