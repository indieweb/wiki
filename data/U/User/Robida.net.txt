I've been a long time fan of the IndieWeb, even before I knew it had a name. I started my first blog back in 2000, and since then I've written a good dozen custom blog engines. I mostly program in Python, but I also enjoy Guile and started my career as a webmaster using PHP.

My current blog is hosted at https://robida.net, and developed at https://codeberg.org/robida/site. It supports:

* 🏠 An h-card on the homepage!
* 🔐 IndieAuth client, so I can log in here 🙂
* 🧾 OIDC client, because why not?
* 🧩 A custom library for microformats2 parsing (https://codeberg.org/robida/mf2dom) that uses JustHTML for HTML parsing and can generate isomorphic HTML back from mf2json.
* ✍️ A MicroPub endpoint
* 📡 JSONFeed, RSS, Atom

Planned features:

* 🗒️ Add some posts so it’s an actual blog…
* 📡 WebSub? MicroSub?
* ⚙️ Add MicroPub extensions
* 🤔 ?
