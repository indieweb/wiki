I started my first blog back in 2000, and since then I've written a good dozen custom blog engines. I mostly program in Python, but I also enjoy Guile and started my career as a webmaster using PHP.

My [https://robida.net blog] is [https://codeberg.org/robida/site open source]. Current functionality:

* 🏠 An h-card on the homepage!
* 🔐 An IndieAuth client, so I can log in here 🙂
* 🧾 An OIDC client, because why not?
* 🧩 A custom library for microformats2 parsing called [https://codeberg.org/robida/mf2dom mf2dom] that uses [https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml JustHTML] for HTML parsing and can generate isomorphic HTML back from [[mf2json]]. I use this because I store everything as mf2json — my posts, posts from people I follow, my h-card, etc.
* ✍️📡 Micropub and Microsub endpoints that I use with [[IndiePass for Android]].
* ⚙️ Micropub extensions: slug, post status, visibility, post list, category/tag list, limit parameter.
* 📡 Feeds: JSONFeed, RSS, Atom, JF2
* 📊 Integrations: Oura, Withings, Strava
* 🤖 MCP tools via OAuth 2.1 with DCR

Next planned features:

* 👂🏼 Receiving Webmentions
* 📣 Sending Webmentions
* 📡 WebSub
* 🤔 ActivityPub?
