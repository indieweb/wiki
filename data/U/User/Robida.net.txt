Heya, I'm Beto!

I've been a long time fan of the IndieWeb, even before I knew it had a name. I started my first blog back in 2000, and since then I've written a good dozen custom blog engines. I mostly program in Python, but I also enjoy Guile and started my career as a webmaster using PHP.

My current blog is hosted at https://robida.net, and developed at https://codeberg.org/robida/site. It supports:

* h-card
* IndieAuth client, so I can log in here. :)
* OIDC client, because why not?

Planned features:

* Add some posts so it's an actual blog
* Set up a MicroPub endpoint
* Set up an RSS/Atom/JSON feed
* ?
