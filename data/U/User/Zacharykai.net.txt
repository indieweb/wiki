== Intro ==
Hi! I'm Zachary Kai, a scifi writer, an offbeat queer, twenty-something, curiosity enthusiast, and traveler. I started [https://zacharykai.net my site] in March 2024, and have loved tinkering with it ever since.

My sparkline and chat nickname: {{zachary.kai}}

== Websites ==
I have my site at [https://zacharykai.net zacharykai.net], my independent press at [https://lunaseeker.com lunaseeker.com], and a book blog called [https://roadlessread.com Road Less Read.]

Inspired by {{capjamesg}} and {{artlung}}, I have a [https://lab.lunaseeker.com lab] where I publish experiments that didn't fit anywhere else.

They're all static html and css, with a few php scripts for automations.

I host a FreshRSS instance for myself (plus my sites) on an Ubuntu VPS.
