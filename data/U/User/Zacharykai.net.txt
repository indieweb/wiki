== Intro ==
Hi! I'm Zachary Kai, a scifi writer (THE MARA FILES, DON'T BURN TOO BRIGHT), and the sole operator of the book blog Road Less Read.

Also an offbeat queer, twenty-something, curiosity enthusiast, and traveller.

== Websites ==

I'm building [https://zacharykai.net/ zacharykai.net] as my personal site, and [https://www.roadlessread.com/ roadlessread.com] is my book blog. Still learning about making websites!

== Itches ==

I'd like to:
* Build more slashpages on ZK.
* Create a directory for my own slashpage.
