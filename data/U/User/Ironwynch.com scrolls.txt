[https://ironwynch.com IronWynch.com] is the homepage of K. Sis. Nicole T. Lasher. The [https://ironwynch.com/scrolls /scrolls] directory is the blog.

I'm a writer, artist, and a curator of content, so if you have anything you think I or my readers will be interested in seeing, please feel free to contact me.

My personal blog is a mix of a journal, a soapbox, and some interesting stuff about my orientation. I also post often about science and technology.

I'm an African and Indigenous (Iswa) American who has expatriated to Israel. That is an interesting and long story. Kind of funny.

You can follow me on [https://www.tribel.com/ironwynch/wall Tribel] or [https://mastodon.social/@IronWynch Mastodon].

This page is a work in progress. I will be adding more soon.
