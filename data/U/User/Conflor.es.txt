Hi! I'm Eri, a developer from Galicia.

== conflores ✿ ==

This is the first time I made a blog in years. I'm trying to rekindle my love of writing and finding community along the way.

It is a drawer full of everything, from veggie recipes to photos of my cat, as well as some more technical posts about open source contributions.
