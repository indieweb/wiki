== Itches ==

* Create a basic list of information "flows" for federated content...where each thing I do (https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts) happens and how it gets federated. Ultimately, I want [https://boffosocko.com/2022/05/03/how-to-live-the-indieweb-dream/ *all* of it to have a home on my site].


<s>* Tear down fncll.org, but the big decision to be made: do I stick with WordPress?
** '''Pros''': I can host it myself. I'm very familiar with WP, have reasonable understanding of the architecture, and some PHP skills. WordPress can accommodate a wide variety of length and media. There's obviously a pretty active community generally and in IndieWeb circles.
** '''Cons''': WordPress is only getting heavier, and it feels like the Gutenberg/Block editor signal continued development in a way that appears to complicate IndieWeb implementation. There are other platforms that have been designed with IndieWeb and federated content in mind. I want to simplify the weight of my future site and go with a minimalistic design...so WordPress is probably overkill.</s>

== Progress ==

* Set up the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ WordPress IndieAuth Plugin] on chrislott.org -- which is destined, I think, to remain a calling card site and a stable home for being my own authorizer, where fncll.org will be the big tent site. Still trying to figure out of this makes sense -- I want to continue my "fncll" identity, generally, but my long established mail @chrislott.org and such makes me want to use that domain (and have something there).

* Used the above point to create my login here, set up my [https://indieweb.org/wikifying#Infobox_Profile Infobox], [https://indieweb.org/chat-names chat name], and [https://indieweb.org/wikifying#Step_Four:_Add_a_sparkline sparkline].

* Added [[Mastodon]] links to profile (also still trying to determine if there's any point, for me, to existing on multiple Mastodon sites).

* Registered my interest in a few possible [https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Sessions future Pop-up sessions].

* Decided I will stick with WordPress and began setting up [https://fncll.org/ FNCLL] with IndieWeb plugins.
