Hey there, I'm Björn from lovely <span class="p-locality">Nuremberg</span>/<span class="p-country-name">Germany</span>.

I'm a <span class="p-role">data center management guy</span> in my professional life. In my spare time I run a free self-hosted services for me and my family and try to establish an online presence with my website <span class="p-url">https://bjoern.stierand.org</span>. Besides that I go by the handle @egoexpress on various social networks, but apart from [https://github.com/egoexpress GitHub] and  [https://untappd.com/user/egoexpress Untappd] I don't use those anymore.

I currently use [[Known]] for my website (and even developed some plugins for it). I was a regular participant at the [[Homebrew_Website_Club|Homebrew Website Club]] meetups in Nuremberg that {{jkphl}} organized and I'd like to establish those meetups again anytime soon.

== My personal itch ==
<div class="p-note">

===Setup a Digital Garden===

My currently running website based on [[Known]] presents entries in typical blog form as a stream. This puts a lot of pressure on oneself to keep the site up-to-date and have a post on the top that is not months or even years old.
I want to change this to a more relaxed and calm setup. The current plan is to ditch the [[Known]] website altogether and set up a [[digital_garden|Digital Garden]] based on [[Obsidian]].

===Journaling===

For years now I try to collect all the stuff I put on the interwebs on my own site. After some tries with a self-written script and adventures into [https://github.com/espresto/reclaim-social-media/ Reclaim Social Media] I used [https://github.com/egoexpress/sifttter-redux-known Sifttter Redux Known], an [http://ifttt.com IFTTT]-Dropbox-Ruby script setup I adapted to work with the [[Known]] API. 

This area lays pretty dormant right now and I want to get this up running again, maybe using [[Obsidian]] as my single source of truth. If I want to publish anything, I can use my [[digital_garden|Digital Garden]] setup.

===Having less stuff on the web===

I had too many outlets on the web (2 web sites and one blog) and used too many similar web-based tools (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive). I sized down to just one outlet and cut all the social networks and redundant tools I no longer needed. Also I migrated all my services to just one hoster and now run all my stuff on the same base systems (VPS with Ubuntu, every service in its own Docker container with matching docker-compose configuration). For now, I'm quite happy with the current situation in this space.
