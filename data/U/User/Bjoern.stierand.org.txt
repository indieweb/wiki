= <span class="p-name">Björn Stierand</span> =
Hey there, I'm Björn (with a German umlaut, that is). I'm an <span class="p-role">IT management guy</span> by day and an IndieWeb user and Known plugin developer by night. Well, I'm that by day as well. ;) I live in lovely <span class="p-locality">Nürnberg</span>, <span class="p-country-name">Germany</span>. My outlets on the web are:

* <span class="p-url">https://bjoern.stierand.org</span> (my main site on the Web with links to the  various silos)
* <span class="p-url">https://known.stierand.org</span> (Known site with my 'stream of activities')
* <span class="p-url">https://blog.triatomic.net</span> (my Wordpress blog where I write about my sport activities)
* I'm @egoexpress on various social networks, e.g. [https://twitter.com/egoexpress Twitter], [https://github.com/egoexpress GitHub] and [https://untappd.com/user/egoexpress Untappd].

== My personal itch ==
<div class="p-note">

===Less Stuff===

I have too many (self-hosted) outlets on the web (running different technologies) and use too many similar web-based tools (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive). For the next [https://indieweb.org/2018/Nuremberg IndieWebCamp in Nuremberg] I want to take a step back, analyse what's there and what needs to go. I want to end up with a proper idea what tool to use for which job, less tools in general and a better idea how to handle my outlets on the web and how to manage and present all the data I create and collect.

===Journaling===

For years now I try to collect all the stuff I put on the interwebs on my own site. After some tries with a self-written script and adventures into [https://github.com/espresto/reclaim-social-media/ Reclaim Social Media] I now happily run my own Known instance. I want to setup a kind of journal there, where I collect my daily activities in the various silos and create journal entries. The current setup to implement this uses [https://github.com/egoexpress/sifttter-redux-known Sifttter Redux Known], an [http://ifttt.com IFTTT]-Dropbox-Ruby script setup. This works quite ok for now, but needs some more improvement.
