Hey there, I'm Björn (with a German umlaut, that is). I'm an <span class="p-role">IT management gut</span> by day and and IndieWeb user and Known plugin developer by night. Well, I'm that by day as well. ;) I live in lovely <span class="p-locality">Nürnberg</span>, <span class="p-country-name">Germany</span>. My outlets on the web are:

* <span class="p-url">https://bjoern.stierand.org</span> (my main site on the Web)
* <span class="p-url">https://known.stierand.org</span> (Known site with my 'stream of activities')
* <span class="p-url">http://blog.triatomic.net</span> (Wordpress blog where I write about the sports I do)
* I'm @egoexpress on various social networks, e.g. [https://twitter.com/egoexpress Twitter], [https://github.com/egoexpress GitHub] and [https://untappd.com/user/egoexpress Untappd]

== My personal itch ==
<div class="p-note">
For years I try to collect all the stuff I put on the interwebs on my own site. After some tries with a self-written script and adventures into [http://reclaim.fm/ Reclaim FM] I now happily run my Known instance. 
Currently working on [https://github.com/egoexpress/sifttter-redux-known Sifttter Redux Known], an [http://ifttt.com IFTTT]-Dropbox-Rubyscript setup to create journal entries from my social web activities.
