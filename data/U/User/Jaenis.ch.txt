Hi, I'm André Jaenisch.

I'm a web developer living in Germany.
My tasks usually revolve around Frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript), but I also can handle backend (Python, Node.js, relational databases).

I learned about IndieWeb via microformats and lurking around active IndieWebbers.

You can find me online at https://jaenis.ch/
It's built with Eleventy (JavaScript) and hosted on Uberspace.

My website currently accepts WebMentions, but doesn't show them. I'm planning to untangle the different sources I pull data from (Twitter, GitHub, blogs, podcasts …) to allow for faster reactions. At that point, WebMention will be shown, too.
