Hi, I’m Kevin Yank.

I’m a web geek living in Melbourne, Australia. I’ve been developing websites in one way or another since 1997. Over the years, I’ve worked on web frontends, web application backends, in server administration, managing product design, and I’ve even dabbled in desktop and mobile application development.

I’m best known for my work at [https://www.sitepoint.com/ SitePoint], where I was Chief Technology Officer for over a decade (2002–2012). Besides writing a ton of code for the business, I wrote five editions of the book [https://www.sitepoint.com/store/php-mysql-novice-to-ninja/ PHP & MySQL: Novice to Ninja] (previously titled Build Your Own Database Driven Website Using PHP & MySQL), which together sold well over 25,000 copies. I co-wrote [https://www.sitepoint.com/store/simply-javascript/ Simply JavaScript] (2007), and contributed to [https://www.sitepoint.com/store/everything-you-know-about-css-is-wrong/ Everything You Know About CSS Is Wrong!] (2008) and HTML Utopia: Designing Without Tables Using CSS (2003). I also wrote the weekly SitePoint Tech Times email newsletter from 2002-2010, which went out to some 250,000 subscribers, and co-hosted the weekly [https://www.sitepoint.com/podcast/ SitePoint Podcast] (2008-2010).

I have also spoken at a number of industry events and conferences over the years, including Web Directions South (2006, 2009), Edge of the Web (2009), and Fundamentos Web (2006).

For the past 8+ years, I have led front end engineering at [https://www.cultureamp.com/ Culture Amp], an employee experience platform that HR departments use to build culture-first workplaces.
