I started a [[GitHub Pages]] site for professional reasons and eventually migrated to https://www.ciccarello.me/ as my domain. I was motivated to take control of my blog posts after disliking some of the changes [[Medium]] was making which lead me to some IndieWeb ideas. More background on my site is posted on my [https://www.ciccarello.me/colophon/ Colophon] page.

== Interests ==
* Adding support for [https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues/34 more post kinds on my site]
* Tracking my [[garden]]
* Figure out a [[URL design]] for my posts
* Avoid manually updating profiles across multiple silos
* Easy UX writing/publishing new posts
* [https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues See more in my open issues]

== Brainstorming ==
* Considering having separate feeds for content posts vs activity posts. The thought being, content posts ([[articles]], [[photos]], [[recipes]]) are more interesting to others to consume, where activity posts ([[bookmarks]], [[reactji]], [[replies]]) can feel kind of spamy and distract-from/water-down the main content.
* There are aspects of post-kinds that don't follow my preferences for what shows up in a feed. For example, I have posted some photos that I wouldn't want to show up in my photos feed because they are screenshots or other uninteresting content. I can also see sometime wanting to bookmark or reshare with a comment but I'm not sure that I want those to always or never visible in my feed. An out of band signal might be helpful (perhaps a [[tag]]) but that seems like it could get messy.
