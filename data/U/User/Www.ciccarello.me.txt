I started a [[GitHub Pages]] site for professional reasons and eventually migrated to https://www.ciccarello.me/ as my domain. I was motivated to take control of my blog posts after disliking some of the changes [[Medium]] was making which lead me to some IndieWeb ideas. More background on my site is posted on my [https://www.ciccarello.me/colophon/ Colophon] page.

* Adding support for [https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues/34 more post kinds on my site]
* Figure out a [[URL design]] for my posts
* Avoid manually updating profiles across multiple silos
* Easy UX writing/publishing new posts
