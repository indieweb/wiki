== Hello ==

[[Authorio]] is my first engagement with open source. I built it because I wanted to use my site [reiterate.app Reiterate] to log in via IndieAuth, but I couldn't find the ruby gem to let me do that. So I wrote it.

[https://reiterate.app Reiterate] is my self-coaching app which tries to help people help themselves improve at playing esports. If you play online MOBA games, give it a try!

== Next Steps ==

Now that I can log in, I can start setting up WebMentions for my site's blog, and then enable commenting.
