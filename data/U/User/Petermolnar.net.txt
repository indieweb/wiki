== Current: static generator ==

After spending months on arguing with myself, I finally decided to write my static generator and walk away from WordPress. It took me a long while, but I'm more or less ready. Summary and reasoning: [https://petermolnar.net/going-static Going Static]

=== What, why, how ===

; [[POSSE]]
: My photos are POSSEd to [[Flickr]] via [[bridgy]], but I barely cross-post anything else these days.
; [[PASTA]]
: After speding a lot of time thinking throught [https://petermolnar.net/making-things-private/ what should be on my website] I decided to archive silo interactions, favorites, bookmarks, etc. only in private archives. Most of these require [[OAuth]] 1 or 2, therefore there is a tiny service running which handles callbacks and stores tokens.
; [[Webmention]]s
: Using {{aaronpk}}'s [http://github.com/aaronpk/xray X-Ray] to detect the webmention endpoints (yes, from Python, via a system call) to send webmentions to. The webmentions themselves (from,to,timestamp) are in an SQLite database to skip the ones already done.
; [[Micropub]]
It's not yet done in the 2.x version of my static generator.
; [[search]]
: The site populates an SQLite database using the FTS5 engine for full text search. It comes with a set of weird issues ( no - allowed for example, because it interprets it as a column name), but it works reasonably well and it's extremely simple.
; image and image metadata handling
: It all relies on [[exiftool]] for getting metadata from images, but all my tries for storing all the image related meta (including text and tags) failed due to the lack of a software capable of handling IPTC and XMP with reasonable UI, so I ended up using the same, post-like YAML+Markdown format, with the same name as the photos, therefore they are linked.


== Previously ==

I used WordPress between 2007 and 2016, but in the end I was running a version where I had to apply patches to the core - I tried submitting them but most of them got neglected.

Consider these as abandoned or on hold projects.

* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] - an alternative webmentions plugin for WordPress. It's most probably broken by now.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/blogroll2email Blogroll2email]- turns the Blogroll part of WordPress to feed (atom, rss, mf2) parser to send entries as mail; supports [[granary]] json-mf2 format
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-shortslug wp-shortslug] - use pubdate epoch converted to base36 (0-9a-z) as short permalink
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-flatbackups wp-flatbackups ] - an auto-exporter for WordPress, creating a flat, directory based copy of YAML + Markdown (and/or HTML) of every post. This can't be imported, just servers as a fallback plan for [[longevity]].
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-url2snapshot wp-url2snapshot] - to have a backup copy of a linked website, the plugin pulls in an html-only version of every link it can find in any post content and stores it for potential future use. In case a link is not snapshotted yet and is not available on the web anymore, it tries to fall back to the last available version on archive.org.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring-reactions-importer Keyring Social Importers] a reactions (like, fav, comment, etc ) importer for various silos
