== The Present ==

Before the dawn of time - or a proper domain - I went through a cycle of Microsoft FrontPage, a self-composed, PHP CMS, WordPress, and now I'm back on static(ish) site generation since 2016. The project is called [https://github.com/petermolnar/nasg/ Not Another Static Generator], a glorified Python script, and it uses [[webmention.io]], [[brid.gy]], and [[Telegraph]] to be indieweb-friendly.

Reasoning, lessons, conclusions:

* https://petermolnar.net/running-a-static-indieweb-site/ [2018-08-07]
* https://petermolnar.net/making-things-private/ [2017-10-28]
* https://petermolnar.net/going-static/ [2016-12-31]

I ended up outsourcing a lot of content from my site. Currently it's only the home for:

* longer, IT related articles
* long journal entries, mostly about travel
* replies
* short entries
* photos

The outsourced bits:

* bookmarks - [[wallabag]] does a spectacular job at archiving bookmarks
* reposts - reposts are messy, legally and technically
* likes, favorites, etc - I keep them in-silo - they don't make sense out of context

However, I want to remember favs & like, so I made [https://github.com/petermolnar/silo.pasta/ silo.PASTA], a bunch of scripts that creates [[PASTA]] archives from them from various [[silo]]s, and extends these archived images with EXIF data regarding their source and author, following {{cweiske}}'s idea [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/exif-url.htm on the topic].



== Abandoned projects ==

* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] - an alternative webmentions plugin for WordPress. It's most probably broken by now.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/blogroll2email Blogroll2email]- turns the Blogroll part of WordPress to feed (atom, rss, mf2) parser to send entries as mail; supports [[granary]] json-mf2 format
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-shortslug wp-shortslug] - use pubdate epoch converted to base36 (0-9a-z) as short permalink
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-flatbackups wp-flatbackups ] - an auto-exporter for WordPress, creating a flat, directory based copy of YAML + Markdown (and/or HTML) of every post. This can't be imported, just servers as a fallback plan for [[longevity]].
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-url2snapshot wp-url2snapshot] - to have a backup copy of a linked website, the plugin pulls in an html-only version of every link it can find in any post content and stores it for potential future use. In case a link is not snapshotted yet and is not available on the web anymore, it tries to fall back to the last available version on archive.org.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring-reactions-importer Keyring Reactions Importers] a reactions (like, fav, comment, etc ) importer for various silos

== Topics for next IWC (or something similar) ==

* OPML / following shares - format, how, what, what not to, what to do with NSFW or private parts
* follow up {{adactio}}'s idea of licence discovery for reposting
