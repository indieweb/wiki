== The Present ==

Before the dawn of time - or a proper domain - I went through a cycle of Microsoft FrontPage, a self-composed, PHP CMS, WordPress, and now I'm back on static(ish) site generation since 2016.

Reasoning, lessons, conclusions:

== Abandoned projects ==

* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] - an alternative webmentions plugin for WordPress. It's most probably broken by now.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/blogroll2email Blogroll2email]- turns the Blogroll part of WordPress to feed (atom, rss, mf2) parser to send entries as mail; supports [[granary]] json-mf2 format
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-shortslug wp-shortslug] - use pubdate epoch converted to base36 (0-9a-z) as short permalink
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-flatbackups wp-flatbackups ] - an auto-exporter for WordPress, creating a flat, directory based copy of YAML + Markdown (and/or HTML) of every post. This can't be imported, just servers as a fallback plan for [[longevity]].
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-url2snapshot wp-url2snapshot] - to have a backup copy of a linked website, the plugin pulls in an html-only version of every link it can find in any post content and stores it for potential future use. In case a link is not snapshotted yet and is not available on the web anymore, it tries to fall back to the last available version on archive.org.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring-reactions-importer Keyring Social Importers] a reactions (like, fav, comment, etc ) importer for various silos
