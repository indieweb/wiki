Before the dawn of time - or a proper domain - I went through a cycle of Microsoft FrontPage, Macromedia Dreamweaver, a self-composed PHP CMS, WordPress, and now I'm on static(ish) site generator. This lead to  ~3k lines of static, and a few lightly complex regex redirects, so I suggest better planning for URLs.

Some route I've taken are now overtaken by others; a learning curve, if you prefer. These are all still valid.

My site is currently only hosting:

* longer, IT related articles
* journal(ish) and travel entries
* replies
* rare short entries
* photos

What I've outsourced:

* bookmarks - [[wallabag]] does a spectacular job at archiving bookmarks including text- and image content without the overhead of storing the real original content
* reposts - reposts are messy, legally and technically
* likes, favorites, etc - they don't make sense out of context, but in order to have an archival copy, I made  [https://github.com/petermolnar/silo.pasta/ silo.pasta]. It's a [[PASTA]] approach to save favs (and similar data)from various [[silo]]s.
* my current syndication flow for new entries is on [[Integromat]]: it fetches my RSS feed and distributes the content to Google Groups, [[Flickr]], and a [[fediverse]] instance through [[brid.gy]]; sends a webmention from the syndicated copy back to my site; saves the entry and all URLs to archive.org; sends webmentions to u-in-reply-to links via telegraph.p3k.io
