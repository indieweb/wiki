== The Present ==

Before the dawn of time - or a proper domain - I went through a cycle of Microsoft FrontPage, Macromedia Dreamweaver, a self-composed PHP CMS, WordPress, and now I'm on static(ish) site generator. I also have ~3k lines of static, and a few fairly smart regex redirects because of this, so try to avoid these kind of  journeys.

The code is not on Github any more: it's in the root of my web directory, named `build.py`.

=== Reasoning, lessons, conclusions ===

=== Experiments, and self-inflicted injuries ===

<del>* to see if JSON-LD with Schema.org makes sense, everything that renders into HTML has a JSON-LD with Schema.org representation in the Python code. This JSON-LD is what gets sent to the HTML template. It's more painful, than it sounds, but Google mostly says my structured data is reasonable. The background on this is to keep up with how to make content search engine friendly these days, mostly for non-personal projects.</del>

Experiment concluded, summarized in [https://petermolnar.net/article/less-features-cleaner-site/]

=== What's on the site and what's not (and why) ===

Currently it's only the home for:

* longer, IT related articles
* long journal entries, mostly about travel
* replies
* rare short entries
* photos

The outsourced bits:

* bookmarks - [[wallabag]] does a spectacular job at archiving bookmarks including text- and image content without the overhead of storing the real original content
* reposts - reposts are messy, legally and technically
* likes, favorites, etc - they don't make sense out of context, but in order to have an archival copy, I made  [https://github.com/petermolnar/silo.pasta/ silo.pasta]. It's a [[PASTA]] approach to save favs (and similar data)from various [[silo]]s.

== Abandoned projects ==

* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] - an alternative webmentions plugin for WordPress. It's most probably broken by now.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/blogroll2email Blogroll2email]- turns the Blogroll part of WordPress to feed (atom, rss, mf2) parser to send entries as mail; supports [[granary]] json-mf2 format
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-shortslug wp-shortslug] - use pubdate epoch converted to base36 (0-9a-z) as short permalink
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-flatbackups wp-flatbackups ] - an auto-exporter for WordPress, creating a flat, directory based copy of YAML + Markdown (and/or HTML) of every post. This can't be imported, just servers as a fallback plan for [[longevity]].
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-url2snapshot wp-url2snapshot] - to have a backup copy of a linked website, the plugin pulls in an html-only version of every link it can find in any post content and stores it for potential future use. In case a link is not snapshotted yet and is not available on the web anymore, it tries to fall back to the last available version on archive.org.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring-reactions-importer Keyring Reactions Importers] a reactions (like, fav, comment, etc ) importer for various silos

== Topics for next IWC (or something similar) ==

* OPML / following shares - format, how, what, what not to, what to do with NSFW or private parts
* follow up {{adactio}}'s idea of licence discovery for reposting
