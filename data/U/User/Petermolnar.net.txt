== The Present ==

Before the dawn of time - or a proper domain - I went through a cycle of Microsoft FrontPage, Macromedia Dreamweaver, a self-composed PHP CMS, WordPress, and now I'm on static(ish) site generator. This lead to  ~3k lines of static, and a few lightly complex regex redirects, so I suggest better planning for URLs.

=== Reasoning, lessons, conclusions ===

Some route I've taken are now overtaken by others; a learning curve, if you prefer. These are all still valid.

=== What's on the site and what's not (and why) ===

Currently it's only the home for:

* longer, IT related articles
* long journal entries, mostly about travel
* replies
* rare short entries
* photos

The outsourced bits:

* bookmarks - [[wallabag]] does a spectacular job at archiving bookmarks including text- and image content without the overhead of storing the real original content
* reposts - reposts are messy, legally and technically
* likes, favorites, etc - they don't make sense out of context, but in order to have an archival copy, I made  [https://github.com/petermolnar/silo.pasta/ silo.pasta]. It's a [[PASTA]] approach to save favs (and similar data)from various [[silo]]s.


== Using free automatinators ==

I've turned my attention to using services, like [[IFTTT]], etc to see if their free tier can function for indieweb purposes. So far, it looks good. 

My current flow for new articles is on [[Integromat]] - the [http://petermolnar.net/integromat-petermolnar.json JSON blueprint is available from my site]:

== Itches ==

I also want to backfill photos that were once (pre 2010?) present on my site as part of photo portfolio, but got removed when I revisited the way I post photos.
