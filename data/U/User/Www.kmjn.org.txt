Hi, I'm Mark. I've run a pretty DIY personal website since around 2004. Since 2010 it's at [https://www.kmjn.org/ https://www.kmjn.org/]; before that I used grad student webspace under gatech.edu.

As a result of experimenting with different things at different times, I use a hodge-podge of technologies to maintain the site (I don't necessarily recommend them, but they work for me):

* The main top-level pages are just plain hand-written HTML+CSS.
* The [https://www.kmjn.org/publications/ blog] is also mostly hand-written HTML, but I have a home-rolled Perl script (written around 2010) that generates the table of contents, headers/footers on posts, and the Atom feed.
* My [https://www.kmjn.org/publications/ publications page] is generated by [https://github.com/anadrome/cl-pubgen a Common Lisp script] that I wrote around 2017 as a replacement for [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/software/#bibtex2web bibtex2web], which I used for years but found difficult to modify to my liking.
* I have a [https://www.kmjn.org/paperlog/ paper-reading log] that I usually forget to update. This one is generated by a bash script and a [https://mustache.github.io/ Mustache template].
