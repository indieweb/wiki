<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn class="h-card">[https://antonio.is/ Antonio Rodrigues]</dfn>''' is an Indieweb noob learning and building my website as I go. I've first started blogging in 2004, on a free blogging platform, when I moved to Australia as a wait to keep in touch with my friends back home in Brazil. In late 2006 I moved the blog to my own domain, at the time antonioaugusto.net, later in 2009 I moved to antoniorodrigues.org and finally in 2015 to antonio.is.</span>
