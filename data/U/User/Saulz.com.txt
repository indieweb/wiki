'''[https://saulz.com/ saulz.com]''' is my home on the web.

I’m Saul. I build and operate commercial real estate businesses, mostly focused on small-bay industrial and neighborhood retail. Over the years, I’ve grown a large portfolio by doing unglamorous work well: buying right, fixing operations, and staying disciplined when others chase noise.

This site is where I document how I think about value creation, partnerships, leadership, and endurance—both in business and in life. Some posts are tactical. Others are reflections I write to clarify my own thinking.

Outside of work, I’m a husband, a father of three, and someone who likes pushing physical limits. Long races, hard climbs, and uncomfortable challenges tend to teach lessons that carry back into business.
