things are actually going pretty well! here's what i still gotta fix:

* while i have [[micropub]], i can only use it for [[notes]] and [[articles]] so far, since the only h-entry properties it recognises are name, content, and category. it should at least let me like, repost, and reply as well!
* there's also no [[micropub media endpoint]] for dropping inline pics into the entry
* ''and'' no syndication! i can syndicate manually, saving the links to the syndicated copies back into my original entry, but i can't use mp-syndicate-to. this makes writing short entries prohibitively fiddly, since i gotta jump around to a bunch of sites each time

there are more things i wanna get done but the basics are working nicely c:
