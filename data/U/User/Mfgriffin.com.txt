= My IndieWeb Setup =

* So ... I ... don't yet have an indieweb practice, but I'm looking to correct that.
* I'm starting to engage with this now and in public, so maybe I have an IndieWeb practice but it mostly consists of throat-clearing activities.

== Personal Site - mfgriffin.com ==
You can visit [https://mfgriffin.com here]
* Really, this isn't much so far, but is a place to start.

== Portfolio Site - botspoken.com ==

* But is anything there?! not really. 

= My FUTURE IndieWeb Target =

* I have a personal site that doesn't need much to do its job, so I should do that.
* I want to create a portfolio site that also is the start of posting regular content (without yet committing to posting regularly).

== TARGETS - Personal Site - mfgriffin.com ==
* Three key goals for Personal Site:
   * Portfolio - career and creative work focus project share
   * Research and Reading journal
   * Calendar based blogging of events/activities, including sharing recordings and timebased annotations 
* Pick a theme that makes it easy to have multiple portfolios: 
  * PORTFOLIO: Default (Professional) + Resume
  * PORTFOLIO: Creative Focus  
  * PORTFOLIO: 3D Printing Focus
* Am looking at this Hugo theme: [https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-myportfolio-theme/ MyPortfolio Theme]

== TARGETS - Portfolio Site - botspoken.com ==
* Holding for now. Might build our better landing pages for project groupings and artwork?
