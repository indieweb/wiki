= My IndieWeb Setup =

* So ... I ... don't yet have an indieweb practice, but I'm looking to correct that.
* I'm starting to engage with this now and in public, so maybe I have an IndieWeb practice but it mostly consists of throat-clearing activities.

= Personal Site - mfgriffin.com =

* Really, this isn't much, but is a place to start.

= Portfolio Site - botspoken.com = 

* But is anything there?! not really. 

= My FUTURE IndieWeb Target =

* I have a personal site that doesn't need much to do its job, so I should do that.
* I want to create a portfolio site that also is the start of posting regular content (without yet committing to posting regularly).

== Itches ==
* figure out how to rsvp to indieweb camp nyc 2019
* maybe fill out this page as a means of collecting and organizing my journey into indieweb participation!
* thinking to have stuff i'd like to do start as itches, and then become projects to do in "My FUTURE IndieWeb Target" and then if I use it, describe it in the "My IndieWeb Setup." At least that is my thinking.
