Really, this isn't much, but is a place to start.

= My FUTURE IndieWeb Target =

== Itches ==

* maybe fill out this page as a means of collecting and organizing my journey into indieweb participation!
* thinking to have stuff i'd like to do start as itches, and then become projects to do in "My FUTURE IndieWeb Target" and then if I use it, describe it in the "My IndieWeb Setup." At least that is my thinking.
