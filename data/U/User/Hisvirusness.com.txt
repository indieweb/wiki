== Introduction ==

Hi, I'm Paul, and I'm an al... wait, wrong context.

My name is Paul Mason: graphic artist, writer, tinkerer, and fervent Linux fanatic.  For the last ~12 years, I've been making stuff under the name ''HisVirusness''.  If you've ever been on a sketchy website that has a collection of desktop wallpapers available for download, odds are you've seen my work before.

I run [http://HisVirusness.com HisVirusness.com], a hand-coded site featuring (most of) those aforementioned things, and then some!  Mostly stories about mentally ill PIs and posts whining about Batman movies.  With more to follow!

== Why The Name? ==

Good question, hypothetical person.  Long story short, it's derived from a nickname I got while doing stand-up comedy in Chicago during the early 2010's.  Perhaps someday, I'll go into further detail.

== Interest In IndieWeb ==

The Internet has gotten too small, and the general public knows it.  I once had a stranger, with full conviction, tell me you couldn't create a website without a license from either Amazon or Google.  After I told this person that you could literally create a web server in your own home, they cut me off with, "No, that's the darkweb; that's how you get FBI raids."

It's both hilarious and infuriating at the same time.  Don't get me wrong: I Love social media, and I love YouTube (so much so, that I pay money for YouTube Premium), but the proliferation of these services has boiled the modern Internet down to just a handful of websites.  As someone who has been online for more than a quarter of a century, it saddens and frightens me at the same time.  Your content should be '''yours''', to do with as you please.  And, if displaying said-content happens to also show off your sweet design and coding skills, even better!

I'll, uh, put my soapbox away now.
