== Introduction ==

Hi, I'm Paul, and I'm an al... wait, wrong context.

My name is Paul Mason: Graphic artist, writer, tinkerer, and fervent Linux fanatic.  For the last ~12 years, I've been making stuff under the name ''HisVirusness''.  If you've ever been on a sketchy website that has a collection of desktop wallpapers available for download, odds are you've seen my work before.

I currently run [http://HisVirusness.com HisVirusness.com], a hand-coded site featuring (most of) those aforementioned things, and then some!  Mostly stories about mentally ill PIs and posts whining about Batman movies.  With more to follow!

== Why The Name? ==

Good question, hypothetical person.  Long story short, it's derived from a nickname I got doing stand-up comedy in Chicago during the early 2010's.  Perhaps someday, I'll go into further detail.
