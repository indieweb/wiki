== Introduction ==

My name is Paul Mason: graphic artist, writer, tinkerer, and fervent Linux fanatic.  For the last ~12 years, I've been making stuff under the name ''HisVirusness''.  If you've ever been on a sketchy wallpaper website, odds are you've seen my work before.

I run [http://hisvirusness.com HisVirusness.com], a hand-coded site that showcases my penchant for doin' the most.  Along with some old fan art and YouTube edits, you'll find... mostly stories about mentally ill PIs and strong opinions about Batman movies.  Also, some technical notes on the site itself.

== Why The Name? ==

Good question, hypothetical person.  Long story short, it's derived from a nickname I got while doing stand-up comedy in Chicago during the early 2010's.  Perhaps someday, I'll go into further detail.

== Interest In IndieWeb ==

The Internet has gotten too small.  People honestly think you need permission from Google or Amazon to start a website, when you can literally broadcast one from your bedroom, on the computer you use, while you're using it!

'''Side Note''': Not advisable; don't do that, especially if you have Windows.  I'm speaking from experience.

Anyway, because of that, they rely on these external services for everything, thinking they have no alternative.  If I make something and put it on someone else's platform, even if my name is on it, it's never really ''mine''.  I've done it for almost a decade and a half, and in the words of the late great Owen Hart: Enough is enough, and it's time for a change.  I'd been wanting to do this for years, and have finally taken my first steps in taking my work back.

== hVmark ==

[https://hisvirusness.com/hvmark hVmark] is the lightweight, opinionated markup language I created and maintain for my site. It was created because I like Markdown in theory more than in practice. hVmark makes things more efficient and produces clean, consistent HTML for long-term maintenance and posterity.

Pages and posts bend to the will of hVmark, not the other way around. If a layout breaks, then the content is adjusted, not the parser. The overall goal is to keep the parser lean, responsive, and free of any bloat caused by edge cases. In short: hVmark is meant to be ''worked around when necessary'', not endlessly extended.
