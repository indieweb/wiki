== Introduction ==

Hi, I'm Paul, and I'm an al... wait, wrong context.

My name is Paul Mason: graphic artist, writer, tinkerer, and fervent Linux fanatic.  For the last ~12 years, I've been making stuff under the name ''HisVirusness''.  If you've ever been on a sketchy website that has a collection of desktop wallpapers available for download, odds are you've seen my work before.

I run [http://HisVirusness.com HisVirusness.com], a hand-coded site that showcases my penchant for doin' the most.  Along with some old fan art and YouTube videos, you'll find... mostly stories about mentally ill PIs and posts whining about Batman movies.  With more to follow!

== Why The Name? ==

Good question, hypothetical person.  Long story short, it's derived from a nickname I got while doing stand-up comedy in Chicago during the early 2010's.  Perhaps someday, I'll go into further detail.

== Interest In IndieWeb ==

The Internet has gotten too small.  People honestly think you need permission from Google or Amazon to start a website, when you can literally broadcast one from your bedroom, on the computer you use, while you're using it!

'''Side Note''': Not advisable; don't do that, especially if you have Windows.  I'm speaking from experience.

Anyway, because of that, they rely on these external services for everything, thinking they have no alternative.  If I make something and put it on someone else's platform, even if my name is on it, it's never really ''mine''.  I've done it for almost a decade and a half, and in the words of the late great Owen Hart: Enough is enough, and it's time for a change.  I'd been wanting to do this for years, and have finally taken my first steps in taking my work back.
