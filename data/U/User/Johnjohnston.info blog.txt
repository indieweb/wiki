==Introduction==

I am {{John Johnston}} a primary school teacher from Scotland. I've been blogging for a while, mostly about using technology in class. 

I started installing the IndieWeb plugins on my site around the end of 2014, without doing a lot of reading or research. My interest in the indieweb was intensified when I backed micro.blog on kickstarter.

==Website==

Mostly http://johnjohnston.info/blog which started on another domain (my school at the time) using pivot, migrated to its own domain in 2008 and changing to WordPress in around 2015.
