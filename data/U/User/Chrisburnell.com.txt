== OwnYourPint ==

[https://ownyourpint.chrisburnell.com/ OwnYourPint ] is an IndieWeb tool for syndicating [[Untappd]] checkins to your own website. OwnYourPint uses the [[Untappd]] API to poll your account every *n* minutes, and when new checkins are found, sends them to your [[Micropub]] endpoint to do with what you like (i.e. post)!

=== Complete: ===

* Authentication using [[IndieAuth]]
* Associating an [[Untappd]] account with your own website
* Polling the [[Untappd]] API for fresh data
* Unpacking the data and preparing it to send as a [[Micropub]] POST request

=== Not yet complete: ===

* Determining which checkins have/have not been POSTed to the [[Micropub]] endpoint
* Sending the [[Micropub]] request
* Handling the callback
* Manually selecting checkins to POST to the [[Micropub]] endpoint
* Turning *toasts* and *comments* on checkins into standalone pages to be sent as a Webmention to the post on one's own website
** Including checkins which have already been posted on one's own website

== Itches ==

* I've been scratching a lot? :)
