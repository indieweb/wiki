== My IndieWeb Setup ==
* https://chrisburnell.com is my primary home where I post:
** [[note|Notes]], [[bookmark|Bookmarks]], [[like|Likes]], [[reply|Replies]], and [[rsvp|RSVPs]] and [[PESOS]] them to:
*** [[GitHub]] - https://github.com/chrisburnell/chrisburnell.com (the default target)
*** [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/iamchrisburnell (with destination threading to help the Twitter user's experience)
*** [[Mastodon]] - https://mastodon.social/users/chrisburnell
** [[food|Beer]] and [[PESOS]] them to:
*** [[Untappd]] - https://untappd.com/user/chrisburnell
I still need to do some work to change my syndication model from [[PESOS]] to [[POSSE]]. At the moment, because my [[Micropub]] endpoint doesn’t have the ability to modify an existing post, I first post to [[Twitter]] and/or [[Mastodon]] and grab the permalinks from the responses which are then pumped into the front matter as syndication targets of the post when it gets posted to [[GitHub]].
