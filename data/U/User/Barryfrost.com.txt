I'm Barry (he/him), a software engineer who's no longer paid to code and instead leads engineers in my day job. Hacking on my own projects in my spare time helps scratch my itch to make things.

My timezone is Europe/London and I'm based in Hertfordshire, UK.

== IndieWeb projects ==

=== Vibrancy ===
When the spread of Covid brought lockdowns in early 2020, I decided to rewrite my personal website. [https://github.com/barryf/vibrancy Vibrancy] is the end result after roughly a year of gentle, evening hacking.

It's the fourth version of my software intended to support IndieWeb technologies (the first launched in [https://barryfrost.com/2013/09/baker-1 September 2013]) but I've used barryfrost.com as my personal domain since 2002.

=== [[Micropublish]] ===
[https://micropublish.net Micropublish] is my [[Micropub]] web client, first released in February 2015. The latest version supports Micropub creates, edits, deletes and undeletes.

It's still under active development.

=== Wembley ===
[https://github.com/barryf/wembley Wembley] is a [[Webmention]] receiver to be used as an endpoint to receive webmentions for your website.

It's very much a work-in-progress and not ready for use, but I wanted to share progress as the spec evolves.

=== [[Transformative]] ===
My website's previous software was [[Transformative]]. I've stopped developing the platform but it's available in GitHub.

=== Promulgate ===
[https://github.com/barryf/promulgate Promulgate] is a WebSub hub. It uses Redis for data storage and [http://sidekiq.org Sidekiq] for background jobs.

=== Acquiescence ===
[https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence Acquiescence] is an IndieAuth authorization and token endpoint. Currently it supports one OAuth2 provider (GitHub) because that's what I use.

=== Webhook Mentions ===
Although I don't use GitHub Pages to host my site, I wanted to experiment with a way of updating allowing static sites to automatically send webmentions. [https://github.com/barryf/webhook-mentions Webhook Mentions] allows you to take advantage of GitHub's free and simple hosting while using core IndieWeb technologies.

=== Tokenate ===
[https://github.com/barryf/tokenate Tokenate] is a tiny web app to help retrieve scoped tokens from a token endpoint. I used it to help test [[Transformative]].
