Hello, I'm Barry, a CTO (full-time director, part-time hacker) based in Surrey and London in the UK. 

I attend the London [[Homebrew_Website_Club]].

== IndieWeb projects ==

=== [[Transformative]] ===
I'm building [[Transformative]], my IndieWeb personal website software in Ruby that I use at [https://barryfrost.com barryfrost.com]. 

It's the third version of my software intended to support IndieWeb technologies (the first launched in [https://barryfrost.com/2013/09/baker-1 September 2013]) but I've used barryfrost.com as my personal domain since 2002.

=== Micropublish ===
[https://micropublish.net Micropublish] is my [[Micropub]] web client, first released in February 2015. The latest version supports Micropub creates, edits, deletes and undeletes.

=== Promulgate ===
[https://github.com/barryf/promulgate Promulgate] is a WebSub hub I'm building. It uses Redis for data storage and [http://sidekiq.org Sidekiq] for background jobs. It's currently in use by my site for its WebSub pings.

=== Acquiescence ===
[https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence Acquiescence] is a simple IndieAuth authorization and token endpoint. Currently it supports one OAuth2 provider (GitHub) because that's what I prefer. I use Acquiescence for my own site's auth/token endpoint.

=== Webhook Mentions ===
Although I don't use GitHub Pages to host my site, I wanted to experiment with a way of updating allowing static sites to automatically send webmentions. [https://github.com/barryf/webhook-mentions Webhook Mentions] allows you to take advantage of GitHub's free and simple hosting while using core IndieWeb technologies.

=== Tokenate ===
[https://github.com/barryf/tokenate Tokenate] is a tiny web app to help retrieve scoped tokens from a token endpoint. I used it to help test [[Transformative]].

== I can help with ==
* Ruby (to a reasonable level)
* nginx setup and SSL 
* Heroku and Digital Ocean hosting advice/tips
