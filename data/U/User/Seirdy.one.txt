<h2 id="indieweb-support">IndieWeb Support</h2>

I love how the Indieweb lets us own and control our content, without being <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">domesticated</a> by walled-gardens and closed silos.

My Web site and Gemini capsule are built using Hugo. The website features microformats2 (and microformats1) support for h-entry, h-card, and h-feed (hEntry, hCard, and hAtom) and webmention support. It also makes extensive use of Microdata with schema.org vocabularies. I include long blog posts and bookmarks autogenerated from my Buku bookmarks collection.

The Gemini version has all the same content, sans bookmarks; I'm working on getting bookmarks to display well.

Currently working on turning my bookmarking script (sends bookmarks to Buku, then rebuilds my Bookmarks page using data from Buku and POSSEs them to TinyGem) into a proper program and then publishing the code.

<h2 id="other-features">Other features</h2>

The site is tested to work in NetSurf, w3m, Links2, edbrowse, Firefox, Webkit2GTK3, and Chromium. It can be correctly parsed by the Readability article extractor, and parsed fairly well by Chromium's DOM Distiller. It supports screen sizes 240px (KaiOS phones, DPR=1) and up and should meet WCAG 2.2 AA+ requirements, with partial AAA support. It uses the user's preferred color palette for the light color scheme and a custom palette for user agents that request a dark scheme.

I also mirror to a Tor hidden service. The hidden service is identical, save for the use of .onion URLs and the use of PNGs in place of SVGs (the Tor Browser's "safest" settings blocks SVG rendering but still downloads them to avoid fingerprinting). My IndieWeb photo would otherwise be an SVG that conforms to the W3C's "SVG Tiny" specification, for maximum compatibility with other SVG programs. To accomodate the higher latencies on the Tor network, my 32x32 PNG photo is inlined; this is acceptable because it's under 150 bytes.

All of this fits into less than 8kb thanks to Brotli compression and a tiny inline CSS stylesheet (allowed with a CSP hash). 8kb was the budget I set for myself because the area outside my house often gets download speeds of around 64 kilobits per second on mobile data, enough to download my website within 1 second (excluding round-trip latency).
