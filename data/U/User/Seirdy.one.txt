Also known by my online handle, Seirdy. The Director&rsquo;s Cut of my bio is at my <a href="/about.html">About page</a>.

I'm a FOSS enthusiast, software minimalist, and a CS+Math undergrad who likes watching anime and tweaking his Linux setup.

I love how the Indieweb lets us own and control our content, without being <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">domesticated</a> by walled-gardens and closed silos.
