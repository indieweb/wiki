I'm collecting requests from [[IRC]] here when they're something I can't handle quickly and immediately. Roughly FIFO, feel free to re-arrange if you have reasons to suggest a specific prioritization
* document existing [[Webmention]] sender/receiver interop beyond [[Webmention]] specification as minimal W3C Notes in (new if needed) https://tantek.com/github repos. Minimal preamble/intro/abstract, conformance classes (publishers, receivers), what publishers should do (list 3 impls that do, link to more), what receivers should do (list 3 impls that do, link to more). minimize overlap between Notes.
** [[WebStream]] — [[h-feed]], [[h-entry]] as currently interoperably supported 
*** [[h-feed]]
*** [[h-entry]]
*** all interoperably supported additional properties for various [[responses]]
*** superset (another way of documenting all) of the below Web* specs
** [[WebComment]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[reply]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents).
*** commonalities in displaying [[comments]]
*** AKA WebComments or "Web Comments".
** [[WebLike]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[like]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents)
*** commonalities in displaying [[likes]]
*** AKA WebLikes or "Web Likes".
** [[WebRepost]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[repost]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents)
*** commonalities in displaying [[reposts]]
*** AKA WebReposts or "Web Reposts".
** [[WebRSVP]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[RSVP]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents)
*** commonalities in displaying [[RSVPs]]
*** AKA WebRSVPs or "Web RSVPs".
** [[post-type-discovery]]
*** document how existing consuming implementations parse for [[mf2]]
*** document and cite existing consuming implementations, link to more on indieweb wiki. 
*** cite list of IndieWeb Examples of each post type in the spec
*** update to reference the above Web* specs
*** links from Response Type Discovery algorithm to [[WebComment]], [[WebLike]], [[WebRepost]], [[WebRSVP]] accordingly
*** once a reply/like/repost/RSVP is detected, what to do
* blog about, describe, how to do '''notification first design''' and '''text only design'''
** Use as example: [[like#notification_first_design]], text only design (autolinked text design), inline hypertext design

* cognitive reload [[2014/reposts#Repost_presentation]], brainstorm markup expected to achieve that presentation, add said markup explicitly to [[repost#Brainstorming]], link to that from [[2014/reposts#Repost_presentation]] as a For Follow-up See Repost Brainstorming
* brain dump two #indieweb ideas ([[location]] at vs about, [[checkin]] how to markup) to the wiki from https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-24#t1477349895913000 and https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-25#t1477425283318000 then blog about both!
* Document the corollary for http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed Parser Compat with additional class names per https://github.com/kevinmarks/mf2py/commit/9c7ba2c051292b5dbce2a6e9378fcec46e20a94d Blogger and WordPress defaults inside hfeed
* https://indieweb.org/authorship#Questions
* consider updating various projects indieweb support/compat sections to IndieWeb Friendly section with subsections similar to [[Falcon#IndieWeb_Friendly]], e.g. [[GNU_social#IndieWeb_Compatibility]] (how should we archive past services Spreadly and App.net's former support?)
* write-up and expand [[note#How_to]]
* reflect on what it means to "standardize [[federation]]"
** e.g. in the context of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4013#note_27767988 ([https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/30991 see also this issue])
** figure out what additional documentation on [[federation]] and other pages would help implementers
* reflect on what [[building blocks]] could use improved tutorials for implementing, e.g. like [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/activitypub/gh-pages/activitypub-tutorial.txt this tutorial]
** could any use better diagrams [https://social.tchncs.de/users/mray/updates/54900 like this]?
* Update tantek/contact add to homescreen script for iOS10 from https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen
* update [[RSVPs]] display markup/linking to link directly to indie RSVPs (maybe with the going checkmark / interested asterisk etc.?)
* write a speaker's agreement addendum: If site information about the event, talks, speakers requires JS to view, the speaker is granted a CC-by license to republish any/all event site information so that it does not require JS to view.
* keep processing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufBLI6bB9sg for adding to: [[Loqi#IndieWeb_x_Loqi_Dominate_the_Day]]
* write an mf2 to indieweb version of this article, showing which minimal, typical, maximal properties to use for which effects in indieweb posts and interactions: https://moz.com/blog/meta-data-templates-123
* figure out how to implement delegation on his site so he can have others post for / as him, things like the indie event for HWC SF.
* move https://github.com/tantek/post-type-discovery into the indieweb organization, especially to enable moving ptd.spec.indieweb.org onto a new server with auto-deploy stuff set up and aaronpk needs admin access to the repo to do that
* Broken: try https://indieweb.org/Instagram#Single_Photo_Bookmarklet and either deprecate & document errors, or attempt to quickly fix it
* Atom feed: drop likes, because even fallback content apparently causes poor UX in feed consumers like some micro.blog clients. Write up how this is a good example of Atom / AS1 failure to be extensible, and this unsuitable for evolving social web interactions
* document how lightning talks work at IndieWebCamps, both intros at start, and demos session at the end
* ^^^ maybe not use the label "lightning" - might be more confusing than useful? -- sknebel
* consider helping out with maintenance of [[mf2 plugin]], look at https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/wordpress-pubsubhubbub/blob/c17cf4269ab738ac3ca33fad76a587e425caba56/pubsubhubbub.php#L80 as an example of how mf2 plugin could filter out / rewrite the errant presence of "hfeed" in post permalink markup
* Write-up a [[microformats#FAQ]] for IndieWeb specific questions about microformats that were asked on a recent day in chat starting here https://chat.indieweb.org/2019-06-08#t1560029007948800
** "Hi all, is there a page I can point to that represents a reference of all IndieWeb markup?" [ @rubenverborgh] June 8, 2019
* watch [[2019/building-blocks]] video and type up q&a
* simplify [[Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_Twitter]] by: <br>1. removing use of [[permashortcitation]] (and only using [[permashortlinks]]) and <br>2. extract inline use of CASSIS functions in POSSE explanations, and instead provide them as specific techniques after the full prose explanations.
* re-evaluate [[permashortcitation]] examples and update that page accordingly to reflect actual practices as of today
* update CASSIS auto_link function YT embedding to use privacy enhanced mode [[YouTube#How_to_embed_with_privacy-enhanced_mode]]
* Write an update to [http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web On Silos vs an Open Social Web [#indieweb]]
* incorporate into webmention/reply-context storage brainstorming, and on [[Falcon#Working_On]]: https://indieweb.org/Webmention-brainstorming#storage - IWC 2016
* simplify (restructure if necessary) [[wikify]] to be more approachable and usable (at a minimum not stress out aaronpk)
* Create a UnitConverter single page site as an expansion of the ASIN.cc site, with a service worker for offline support, and expanded to handle common temperature, distance, weight/mass, cooking units (perhaps using code from the UnitConverter HyperCard stack)
* file an issue on [[Bridgy Fed]] requesting @-@ recognition in the plain text of the content of posts and inclusion of explicit @-mention entities, specifically the "to" key in an AS2 activity as documented here: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#microsyntaxes (presuming that Mastodon recognizes that key), and delivery to the inboxes of @-mentioned individuals in addition to any reply-to or follower inboxes
* Add details of my experience migrating from xoxo.zone/@t to Bridgy Fed, which parts looked like they work (all?) and which parts appear to not be working now (still have followings/followers at the old account, old profile doesn't redirect to new profile - my personal site, etc.) [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/330 #330 Add account migration (Move) support]
* blog about the "house party protocol" and how it helped inspire [[Vouch]]
* Working On: recognize and cluster multiple [[reaction]]s that are in-reply-to the same post! e.g. https://tantek.com/2023/279/
* consider documenting [[at-mention]] (aliases [[@ mention]], [[@-mention]], [[at mention]]) as its own page separate from [[person mention]] and leaving a sub-section summary behind there.
* consider documenting [[@-@]] as its own page as well, a particular form of [[at-mention]], with aliases [[at at]], [[at-at]]
* [[Falcon]]: code up a UI to switch off display of syndication links by silo, perhaps start with a static array of "dead-to-me-silos" domains in falcon.php
* ^ perhaps a tri-state per syndication destination: on, use Internet Archive copy, off
* implement syndicating original content to IndieNews, perhaps by detecting hashtag # IndieNews in a post and then autogenerating an embedded syndication link to IndieNews accordingly
* ^ https://news.indieweb.org/how-to-submit-a-post
* Respond to https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit pointing out that "credible exit" is meaningless jargon use of "credible", that GitHub is a bad example because you can't export all the stuff *about* a repo (issues etc.), and similarly Mastodon is not because no post portability, but the general methodology of a solution is good
* add sparkline SVG generation support to [[CASSIS]] so it can be run on the server and return an SVG to the browser instead of the clientside JS that folks are sending to their site viewers in embed tags
* design a scrolling reader UI & backend that inserts the urgent things you need to do (from your to-do list) at the top of the list of scrolling items, and has a done ✅  button next to them which logs that item as a private task completion post.
* ^ Related: generate timely items at the top of your reader feed just below urgent to-do items, according to user settings, items like "update & make my recently synced [[exercise]] post(s) including on [[Strava]]" or "check-in to your current location because you've been here a few min and it's away from your prev venue"
* ^ More generated items: per user settings, suggest continuing streaks of desired habits like "you're at 2500 steps for today, go for a walk to achieve your goal of 10k daily steps and extend your 3 day streak!" which could go auto-hide if/when you go walk 1k+ steps and then upon achieving your daily goal turns into a congrats item. Similar encouragements for writing, posting, and other [[100Days#Brainstorming]] items
* post about implications of https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai in particular, don't even think about using ChatGPT to contribute material to the IndieWeb wiki, Wikipedia, W3C or other standards specifications, because you don't have the ability to know you can contribute it to the public domain / CC0 / other CLAs.
* post about naming user features vs plumbing support, some notes in [[naming]], and example of: re: IndieAuth being jargony and not a good name for a user-facing service, this is literally one of the reasons why in UX/UI discussions I still use "Web sign-in" for the name of the user feature, not IndieAuth. https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2024-01-22#t1705884673885800
** "btw, aaronpk, re: IndieAuth being jargony and not a good name for a user-facing service, this is literally one of the reasons why in UX/UI discussions I still use "Web sign-in" for the name of the user feature, not IndieAuth." [http://Tantek.com @[tantek]] January 22, 2024
* figure out how to check http://micro.blog @t mentions and make sure I can do so on mobile browsers, then start going through them and replying if necessary
* LCC version of Dewmoji. Consider using Dewey to LCC conversion https://library.kilgore.edu/lc_dewey.htm or [https://guide.unwsp.edu/c.php?g=57327&p=367922 Dewey Decimal Classification to Library of Congress Classification] and existing Dewmoji as a starting point.
* side project idea: go through "popular" "simple" npm packages and write-up one-file code solution alternatives that work by copypasta instead without all the ceremony/overhead/vulns of yet-another-npm dependency
* do an analysis of the home pages that Longnow has linked to from their Session/Episode posts over the years to see how many such home pages are dead (e.g. Clay's home page link on https://longnow.org/seminars/02005/nov/14/making-digital-durable-what-time-does-to-categories/)
* once again double-check code in [[Falcon]] that generates the HTML for [[note]] posts to make sure it is setting an empty p-name property rather than duplicating the content as plain text. per report from aaronpk that homepage first note post still has non-empty p-name, and bug report unfortunately blaming Bridgy Fed: [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1068 #1068 indieweb? to activitypub, content duplicated in 'name' element]
* re-evaluate how much of the plain text content of a note for [[Falcon]] to provide in the title element on note permalinks, perhaps limited to 500 chars or whatever is the default Mastodon note post character limit, continuing to drop leading photo (and other) URLs at the start of the content, perhaps even eliding URLs in the middle of the content to just the domain no scheme and … for the path & fragment.
* implement /embed versions of posts as same as h-entry markup except with blockquote h-cite instead and rel=canonical to u-url and minimal inline styling to match post permalink styling, add link rel=embed for discovery.
* On my replies, maybe allowlist reply-context embed iframe generation with existing algorithmic reply-context in its title attr.
* Maybe manually add curated comments to my posts as iframes in a comments list, with reply threads (including my own replies to replies) nested one-deep in a nested list. Need automark syntax for iframe this url with title (similar to img with alt maybe?)
* Consider blogging about risks of saving your cc info with individual commercial products/services sites/apps e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribou_Coffee#Data_breach
* create a "CSS Zen Garden" of HTML+CSS slide deck [[presentation]]s perhaps starting from the simpler examples on https://speakerdeck.com/p/featured and expanding to include the more complex examples
* need to cluster adjacent GitHub reacji posts, e.g.
** reacji to the same URL
** reacji to issue and/or comments on that same issue
** reacji to issues/comments in the same repo
** reacji to issues/comments in repos of the same org
** possibly reacji at the same HH:MM time stamp (but somehow still have linktext for the different permalinks?)
* medium project: photo archive page per item in [[Falcon]]
* hard project: update at least all broken photos, ideally all photos, to use Flickr embedding instead of other silo CDN embedding
* "Tantek should talk to people working on the Web Share API whom he knows to add a declarative to support webactions." from https://indieweb.org/2019/SF/webactions
** ""
* start 2008 and 2009 storage files to selectively backfill tweets to my own site so I can remove tweet citations from my pbwiki. Eg start with tweet links on http://cassisproject.com
