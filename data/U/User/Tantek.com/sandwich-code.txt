== Why ==
What problems would a sandwich code solve? In particular, a few scenarios:
* Order and get the exact sandwich you want, across a variety of sandwich makers (delis, restaurants, fast food, etc.).
* Place an order with a proxy (person) who can then more reliably convey that order to a sandwich maker so you get the exact sandwich you want
* Avoid allergens or other undesirable ingredients or contamination 
* ...

== Goal ==
A short numerical code that you can
* easily generate from a friendly [[UI]] for your sandwich preferences
* share either as [[plain text]] or a [[QR code]] that encapsulates your sandwich order.

== Prior Art ==
