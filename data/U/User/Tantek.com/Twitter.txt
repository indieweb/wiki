https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended

My private twitter account was inexplicably locked. I use it infrequently for private messages with a limited set of friends, and certainly did not violate any Twitter rules. I am unable to provide a phone number because I do not have one. Please unlock my account and make a note that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!

to unlock @t_silos:

My private twitter account that I use for occasional capturing of Shazams and other similar posts was inexplicably locked. I use it infrequently with a limited set of friends, and certainly did not violate any Twitter rules. I am unable to provide a phone number because I do not have one. Please unlock my account and make a note that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!

Unlocked 2018-238 8/26 20:12:

Hello,

Your account is now unlocked, and we’re sorry for the inconvenience.
 
Twitter has automated systems that find and remove automated spam accounts and it looks like your account got caught up in one of these spam groups by mistake. This sometimes happens when an account exhibits automated behavior in violation of the Twitter Rules (<nowiki>https://twitter.com/rules</nowiki>).

Again, we apologize for the inconvenience. Please do not respond to this email as replies will not be monitored.

Thanks,

Twitter Support

~2018-274 10/1 was once again locked with message "Your account appears to have exhibited suspicious behavior."

2018-285 10/12 reset password via email, still locked. New support request:

My private account @t_silos was locked for no reason and I have reset the password to confirm that I am the valid account owner. Note previous case# 9xxxxxx9 that was resolved by unlocking my account. Please unlock @t_silos and make a note that your automated systems appear to be falsely locking the account repeatedly, and that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!

to unlock @Falcon:

My Twitter account that I use for my very limited user Twitter client was inexplicably locked. I know I've used it only very rarely, and certainly did not violate any Twitter rules. I am unable to provide a phone number because I do not have one. Please unlock my account and make a note that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter! 

was unlocked 2018-276 10/3 18:44 - per email (to be quoted)

2018-277 10/4:

was apparently locked again  - tried logging in. new support request:

I got an email from Twitter support Case# 94726074 last night at 6:44pm PDT saying my @Falcon account is unlocked, and apologizing. When I went to login today, I was immediately redirected to an "Your account has been locked." page. I literally did nothing with my account since it was unlocked last night so I am very confused about why was it locked again?  I am unable to provide a phone number because I do not have one. Please unlock my account and make a note that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter! 

2018-278 10/5 20:42 received mail:
"To unlock your account, please log in and follow the instructions to confirm that you‘re the valid account owner."

2018-285 10/12 reset password via email, still locked. New support request:

My project account @falcon is locked and I cannot provide a phone number to unlock it because I don't have one and have never used a phone number to unlock it. I have reset the password to confirm that I am the valid account owner. Additionally, please note for your records that EVERY locking of this account has been a false positive by your automated systems. There have never been any violations of any Twitter rules. Please unlock my account and make notes of both that your automated systems appear to be falsely locking the account repeatedly, and that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!  

Waiting for unlocking... (2018-10-12 16:30)

2018-277 10/4:

to unlock @t, it was suspended the night before 20:04 PDT:

I noticed this morning when I logged in that my account was suspended, and I had received two emails from Twitter last night at 8:04pm PDT that my account had been suspended, for supposedly "Violating rules against hateful conduct", and second for "Violating rules against evading permanent suspension". There is nothing hateful, threatening, or harassing in any of my tweets or in my profile! @t is my primary public account for me personally. I do have separate project-specific accounts that represent communities, software, or standards, and some of those I share with others that work on those projects. I have not created a new account for a new project in many months however so I am very confused about both of these suspension emails. Please take a look at my tweets and note that they are positive or benign, with perhaps a few criticisms of technology here and there, all of which is well within both Twitter rules, and what I believe is general positive online behavior. Please unsuspend my @t account ASAP! Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

to unlock @indiewebcamp:

My community account @indiewebcamp was locked for no reason. Please document this as a false positive in case there are any future reports. I cannot provide a phone number. Please unlock my account and make a note that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!

I created this account for a community of folks who regularly do yoga as part of the November Project movement. There were no actions taken that would have violated any rules — the account got inexplicably suspended. Please unsuspend this account!
