Capturing some support request test I have submitted, in case it helps

My private twitter account was inexplicably locked. I use it infrequently for private messages with a limited set of friends, and certainly did not violate any Twitter rules. I am unable to provide a phone number because I do not have one. Please unlock my account and make a note that I do not have a phone number so the account should never ask me for one, regardless of the situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!

My private twitter account that I use for occasional capturing of Shazams and other similar posts was inexplicably locked. I use it infrequently with a limited set of friends, and certainly did not violate any Twitter rules. I am unable to provide a phone number because I do not have one.
