This page is for incrementally documenting emojis for [[venue categories]], specifically for [[Foursquare]] venue categories, for use on [[recommendations]] lists for quicker, easier understanding and immediate practical use than approaches taken by Foursquare, OpenStreetMaps, or others.

E.g. see {{gregor}}'s excellent https://gregorlove.com/lists/food-and-drink/

Related but different use of emojis to indicate food item attributes at venues:
* https://tantek.com/2023/114/t1/venues-reviews-personal-pages

Have gone through my own Foursquare lists of recommendations so far:
* ✅ Berlin
* ...

== Venue categories emojis ==
Brainstorming list of emojis for venue categories from my Berlin list from Foursquare:
* 🛒 supermarket
* 🥘 kofte
* 🥣 soup spot
* 🍲 Vietnamese
* 🍔 burgers
* 🥤 juice bar
* ☕️ coffee shop
* 🍛 Indian
* 🌱 vegan and vegetarian restaurant
* ☕️ cafe
* 🛒 organic grocery
* 🛒 health food store
* 🍲 Korean
* 🛒 food & beverage
* 🍣 sushi
* 🍟 fast food
* 🍞 bakery
* ...

== Multiple venue categories ==
[[Foursquare]]/[[Swarm]] allowed 1-3 categories per venue
* a single "primary" venue category (by default, the first category assigned to the venue)
* any time a venue category icon was shown, it represented that primary venue category

Perhaps display (up to?) three emoji per venue to indicate a broader range of what kind(s) of venue it is, in order of what they are most known for first

Concern: too many icons on a page may be confusing

Perhaps only display multiple emoji for a venue when that venue name is displayed on its own, or maybe in a small / short list.

Venue category by menu options
* Consider: infer venue category (or categories) from the larger set of menu options
* e.g. see https://tantek.com/2023/114/t1/venues-reviews-personal-pages emojis for menu item annotations
* What food item(s) is a venue most known for? Perhaps display the emoji accordingly

== Coffee serving venue taxonomy ==
Brainstorming a taxonomy for places that serve [[coffee]]. Possible terms/phrases to consider (or some subset / combination thereof)

Prior art first, then brainstorming based on those.

=== Swarm coffee serving categories ===
[[Swarm]] (and Foursquare previously) has several coffee serving related venue categories:
* ☕️ Café
* ☕️ Coffee Shop

Typically serving at least drip coffee:
* 🍳 Breakfast Spot
* 🥞 Diner

Often serving some kind of (typically drip brewed only) coffee:
* 🍩 Donut Shop
* 🇫🇷 French Restaurant
* ⛽️ Fuel Station

Rarely serving some kind of coffee:
* 🍟 Fast Food Restaurant

All of these seem the wrong granularity, neither general enough to browse quickly, nor specific enough to be decisively useful.

=== OSM on cafes and coffee serving ===
What OSM does for cafes / places serving coffee is a mess and pretty useless IMO:
* https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Coffee — a few bits copy/pasted here per fair use quoting:
** shop=coffee 
** amenity=cafe + cuisine=coffee_shop – A café that mainly serves coffee
** amenity=vending_machine + vending=coffee 
** drink:coffee=yes – Indicates that a feature serves coffee. Can be combined with such tags as e.g. amenity=pub, amenity=bar

Helps very little (if at all) with searching for or comparing venues to go out to for coffee, e.g. with friends.

=== coffee venue taxonomy brainstorming ===
Different kinds of places that serve [[coffee]].

Coffee-centric — places known for their coffee, or the primary reason people go there, roughly more minimal to more featured:
* ☕️ '''coffee stand''' — some grocery stores have these like HSM. And lots of these in the Pacific Northwest too, especially drive-throughs. No "inside" to sit. Some may have food offerings too
* ☕️ '''coffee truck''' — like a food truck that serves primarily coffee (SF has one that frequently parks in Alamo Square park). also no "inside" to sit but may have put out a few folding tables/chairs to use near the truck, or be adjacent to a public seating area. likely more food offerings than a coffee stand.
* ☕️ '''espresso bar''' — primarily focused on espresso drinks, may also sell beans, a few pastries / other snacks. May have some seating. unlikely any hot food or assembled food
* ☕️ '''coffee bar''' — There was a literal "[https://sf.eater.com/2019/1/28/18198002/coffee-bar-mission-sf-closed-cafe-coworking-space Coffee Bar]" in the Mission, San Francisco until 2019, though it fit the definition of "coffeehouse" (see below) in practice
* ☕️ '''coffeehouse''' — primarily serves coffee and similar drinks, plenty of seating, serves as a meeting place. likely to have food, even some prepared/assembled food, or even a minimal kitchen 
* ☕️ '''coffee shop''' — has "diner" vibes in the US, typically serves food prepared in a kitchen, short of a maybe full-on diner. Should very much be ok with you only ordering a coffee, because it's right there in the name.
* ☕️ '''cafe''' — could be a place that serves some food / meals, likely to have "order at the counter" style service

Coffee-adjacent, that is their primary purpose (or what they're known for) is not coffee but typically some sort of food. Sorted roughly nearest (maybe most "feels like" it could be a cafe) to furthest (but still adjacent). Coffee may be considered a (typical) feature or menu item of each of these.
* 🍞 '''bakery''' — lots of bakeries also serve coffee, and sometimes people just go there for a coffee even if the primary purpose of the venue is to bake/make baked goods and based on them. The Mill in SF and Devil’s Teeth Bakery are examples.
* 🍩 '''donut shop''' — similarly to breakfast spots, they serve coffee to accompany food offerings, and it would be ok (context-dependent?) to just get a coffee
* 🍽 '''diner''' — nearly every diner serves classic black drip "diner coffee", and is typically ok with you ordering just a cup of coffee to drink in a mug. Highly adjacent to a "coffee shop".
* 🍳 '''breakfast/brunch spot''' — these all serve coffee, as an accompaniment to the food, and tend to be sit down. it would be odd/weird to go and only get a coffee.
* 🥞 '''pancake house''' — e.g. IHOP, Wafflehouse, and there used to be a place called "Stacks" in Hayes Valley in SF
