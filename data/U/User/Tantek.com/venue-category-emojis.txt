This page is for incrementally documenting emojis for [[venue categories]], specifically for [[Foursquare]] venue categories, for use on [[recommendations]] lists for better display.

E.g. see {{gregor}}'s https://gregorlove.com/lists/food-and-drink/

Related but different use of emojis to indicate food item attributes at venues:
* https://tantek.com/2023/114/t1/venues-reviews-personal-pages

Have gone through my own Foursquare lists of recommendations so far:
* ✅ Berlin
* ...

== Venue categories emojis ==
Brainstorming list of emojis for venue categories:
* 🛒 supermarket
* 🥘 kofte
* 🥣 soup spot
* 🍲 Vietnamese
* 🍔 burgers
* 🥤 juice bar
* ☕️ coffee shop
* 🍛 Indian
* 🌱 vegan and vegetarian restaurant
* ☕️ cafe
* 🛒 organic grocery
* 🛒 health food store
* 🍲 Korean
* 🛒 food & beverage
* 🍣 sushi
* 🍟 fast food
* 🍞 bakery
* ...

== Multiple venue categories ==
[[Foursquare]]/[[Swarm]] allowed 1-3 categories per venue
* a single "primary" venue category (by default, the first category assigned to the venue)
* any time a venue category icon was shown, it represented that primary venue category

Perhaps display (up to?) three emoji per venue to indicate a broader range of what kind(s) of venue it is, in order of what they are most known for first

Concern: too many icons on a page may be confusing

Perhaps only display multiple emoji for a venue when that venue name is displayed on its own, or maybe in a small / short list.

Venue category by menu options
* Consider: infer venue category (or categories) from the larger set of menu options
* e.g. see https://tantek.com/2023/114/t1/venues-reviews-personal-pages emojis for menu item annotations
* What food item(s) is a venue most known for? Perhaps display the emoji accordingly

== Coffee serving venue taxonomy ==
Brainstorming a taxonomy for places that serve [[coffee]]:
* ☕️ espresso bar — primarily focused on espresso drinks, may also sell beans, a few pastries / other snacks. May have some seating. no hot food, unlikely even any assembled food.
* ☕️ coffeehouse — primarily servers coffee and similar drinks, plenty of seating, serves as a meeting place 
* ☕️ coffee shop — has "diner" vibes in the US, without maybe being a full-on diner
* ☕️ cafe — could be a place that serves some food / meals, likely to have "order at the counter" style service

=== Swarm coffee serving categories ===
[[Swarm]] (and Foursquare previously) has several coffee serving related venue categories:
* ☕️ Café
* ☕️ Coffee Shop

Typically serving at least drip coffee:
* 🍳 Breakfast Spot
* 🥞 Diner

Often serving some kind of (typically drip brewed only) coffee:
* 🍩 Donut Shop
* 🇫🇷 French Restaurant
* ⛽️ Fuel Station

Rarely serving some kind of coffee:
* 🍟 Fast Food Restaurant

=== OSM on cafes and coffee serving ===
What OSM does for cafes / places serving coffee is a mess and pretty useless IMO:
* https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Coffee — a few bits copy/pasted here per fair use quoting:
** shop=coffee 
** amenity=cafe + cuisine=coffee_shop – A café that mainly serves coffee
** amenity=vending_machine + vending=coffee 
** drink:coffee=yes – Indicates that a feature serves coffee. Can be combined with such tags as e.g. amenity=pub, amenity=bar
