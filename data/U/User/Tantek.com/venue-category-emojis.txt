This page is for incrementally documenting emojis for [[venue categories]], specifically for [[Foursquare]] venue categories, for use on [[recommendations]] lists for better display.

E.g. see {{gregor}}'s https://gregorlove.com/lists/food-and-drink/

Related but different use of emojis to indicate food item attributes at venues:

Have gone through my own Foursquare lists of recommendations so far:
* ✅ Berlin
* ...

== Venue categories emojis ==
Brainstorming list of emojis for venue categories:
* 🛒 supermarket
* 🥘 kofte
* 🥣 soup spot
* 🍲 Vietnamese
* 🍔 burgers
* 🥤 juice bar
* ☕️ coffee shop
* 🍛 Indian
* 🌱 vegan and vegetarian restaurant
* ☕️ cafe
* 🛒 organic grocery
* 🛒 health food store
* 🍲 Korean
* 🛒 food & beverage
* 🍣 sushi
* 🍟 fast food
* 🍞 bakery
* ...

== Multiple venue categories ==
[[Foursquare]]/[[Swarm]] allowed 1-3 categories per venue
* a single "primary" venue category (by default, the first category assigned to the venue)
* any time a venue category icon was shown, it represented that primary venue category

Perhaps display (up to?) three emoji per venue to indicate a broader range of what kind(s) of venue it is, in order of what they are most known for first

Concern: too many icons on a page may be confusing

Perhaps only display multiple emoji for a venue when that venue name is displayed on its own, or maybe in a small / short list.

Venue category by menu options
* Consider: infer venue category (or categories) from the larger set of menu options
* e.g. see https://tantek.com/2023/114/t1/venues-reviews-personal-pages emojis for menu item annotations
* What food item(s) is a venue most known for? Perhaps display the emoji accordingly

== Coffee serving venue taxonomy ==
Brainstorming a taxonomy for places that serve [[coffee]]:
* ☕️ espresso bar — primarily focused on espresso drinks, may also sell beans, a few pastries / other snacks. May have some seating. no hot food, unlikely even any assembled food.
* ☕️ coffeehouse — primarily servers coffee and similar drinks, plenty of seating, serves as a meeting place 
* ☕️ coffee shop — has "diner" vibes in the US, without maybe being a full-on diner
* ☕️ cafe — could be a place that serves some food / meals, likely to have "order at the counter" style service

=== Swarm coffee serving categories ===
[[Swarm]] (and Foursquare previously) has several coffee serving related venue categories:
* ☕️ Café
* ☕️ Coffee Shop

Typically serving at least drip coffee:
* 🍳 Breakfast Spot
* 🥞 Diner

Often serving some kind of (typically drip brewed only) coffee:
* 🍩 Donut Shop
* 🇫🇷 French Restaurant
* ⛽️ Fuel Station

Rarely serving some kind of coffee:
* 🍟 Fast Food Restaurant

=== OSM on cafes and coffee serving ===
What OSM does for cafes / places serving coffee is a mess and pretty useless IMO:
* https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Coffee — a few bits copy/pasted here per fair use quoting:
** shop=coffee 
** amenity=cafe + cuisine=coffee_shop – A café that mainly serves coffee
** amenity=vending_machine + vending=coffee 
** drink:coffee=yes – Indicates that a feature serves coffee. Can be combined with such tags as e.g. amenity=pub, amenity=bar

Says {{kupietz}}:

This is an area near and dear enough to my heart to feel compelled to rant a bit... (Hence replying here instead of in chat.)  I've given a lot of thought to taxonomies in the past (and indeed have a lot of thoughts and even specific taxonomies written down, which I now regret not having posted on my site yet.)  

I have often said "taxonomy is the most human pursuit", and corollary to that, it's among the easiest to neurotically obsess over.   If you peruse just the menus of my website you may get an idea of my struggles with it... does a top-level menu described the topic of the works in that menu, or the medium they're in? Do my written reviews of favorite music equipment belong under "Music & Sounds" or "Writing"? I just now added a poetry recitation video in a submenu under "Writing", and I don't mind telling you, I wrestled with it, and those categories shift substantially over time as I reconsider things. My hard drive has similar organization problems, too. 

As to your approach to cafes... it's tough. You get what I call "The Pandora Problem", something I felt quite strongly about as a musician, where you're seeking to describe all known examples, whereas I feel taxonomy should ideal completely cover all possibilities. Pandora tries to come up with a "music genome" by identifying concrete traits, which to me is akin to saying my own "genome" or taxonomy is "brown hair, five foot five and a half, brown eyes, light skin" etc. etc. etc.   Just some brainstorming here: Obviously for your coffee taxon you're starting with high level attributes, a real taxonomy, but if you start drilling down into attributes like what types of croissants they offer, you're likely to get lost in the weeds. I would aim more for generalization... you've got things that are all "facilities" as separate top level categories, and what could be "environment" factors (noise, laptops, temperature) as top-level categories.
 I can see the need for, say, a "pastries" category and a "bagel" category at a certain level, and even further divisions of those beneath, but I feel you've skipped there too quickly. There should be "eating" categories for "breakfast" "lunch" and "dinner" (if you choose to break out your "eating" categories on that axis) or "deserts", "main dishes" (I see a further breakdown for "hot dishes" and "cold dishes" there), "beverages", "Side dishes/appetizers/snacks" if you choose that axis.  

I wonder, writing this, if a concrete taxonomy is really the best structure for this. I wonder if the data shouldn't be a huge hash, and the "taxonomy" organized on the fly by queries, not built into the structure of the data storage: "Give me the 'eating' category broken out by 'sweets', 'veggies', and 'meat'." or "Give me the ambience broken out by 'morning', 'noon', and 'night', and then human factors (crowd size, noise, people using laptops) within each of those."   Basically with a strict hierarchical taxonomy you might be trying to squeeze higher-dimensional data structure into a lower-dimensional organizational structure. It leads to the same problems I have with my site menus (and a simple case of it can be seen in practice where I have duplicate items listed in both the "Work In Progress" submenus and the other media-specific menus.)  It can be done, but  IMHO you've got to be very careful about consistency, and you have to be sure in advance what nature of queries you're setting up to handle. I know I've tackled those questions many times in the past and haven't yet, myself, ever come up with a system I can point to as an good example of the way it should be done.
