This page is for incrementally documenting emojis for [[venue]] categories, specifically for [[Foursquare]] venue categories, for use on [[recommendations]] lists for better display.

E.g. see {{gregor}}'s https://gregorlove.com/lists/food-and-drink/

Brainstorming distinguishing places that serve [[coffee]]:
* ☕️ espresso bar — primarily focused on espresso drinks, may also sell beans, a few pastries / other snacks. May have some seating. no hot food, unlikely even any assembled food.
* ☕️ coffeehouse — primarily servers coffee and similar drinks, plenty of seating, serves as a meeting place 
* ☕️ coffee shop — has "diner" vibes in the US, without maybe being a full-on diner
* ☕️ cafe — could be a place that serves some food / meals, likely to have "order at the counter" style service
