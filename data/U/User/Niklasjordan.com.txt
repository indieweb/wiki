== Introduction ==
Ahoy! My name is Niklas. I built my first website when I was 14 years old. I have been a front-end developer for a while and am now a UX architect, who specializes in Product Strategy and Experience Design, in a digital agency. Here I deliver digital products, services & experiences for organisations with cause.

I really get excited about the potential for technology to improve outcomes in environmetal space, focus on real user needs (not just marketing needs) and solve problems that have a great impact on people and planet!

I am also involved in the Sustainable Web and TechForGood Community, give talks at conferences and am co-founder of Webmontag in Schwerin.

== Websites ==
My website was already based on WordPress, ModX, Processwire and Kirby. It has been based on Jekyll for about 2 years now. Currently it supports only a few IndieWeb standards. But that will soon change... ;-)

== Working On ==
In the next weeks I want to rebuild my website with [Kirby CMS] and follow all Indieweb principles.

* implement new content formats
** Image posts: image with description (https://github.com/SiteMarina/guggenheim)

== Done ==

* implement IndieAuth (rel="me")
* add microformats
* add h-card
* recieve and show webmentions on pages (-> 50%)
* implement content formats
** Status updates: short articles without title
