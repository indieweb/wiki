Hi, I’m Andrew. I’ve been a professional web developer since January 1, 1998, when I hung out my shingle under the moniker of [http://andrew.hedges.name/equipoise/ Equipoise Webcraft]. Things were simpler then (you could fit all of HTML including explanations on a single printed sheet of paper!), but what I’ve loved most about this line of work is that there is always a new challenge ahead. There is always something more to learn.

Over the years, I’ve worked for universities, startups, non-profits, and a couple of household names. In 2007, I moved to New Zealand to work for a startup before coming back to the States in 2010 and moving to the Bay Area where I lived for almost 6 years before moving back to my hometown of Portland, Oregon.
