==Intro==
Hello. I'm <span class="h-card">{{sparkline| https://indieweb.org/images/f/f1/lee-calvin-kierstead-avatar.webp}} [[User:thepaperlion.ca|Lee Kierstead]]</span> I am just getting into the Indieweb but I've been tinkering with html, css, and js for years. My site is built with Jekyll and self hosted with Nginx, and I use Cloudflare because it's closest to my location (in order to better serve friends and family who read it).

==Itches==
* create a webmention policies page
* add a books read page with a rating and links to review article
* add a photos page, with flexbox (will need to make thumbnail files)
** a photo layout and permalink (with html) for each image?

==Working On==
* create more posts, and more readable ones at that
** while I have many posts, they are pretty self indulgent
* setting up a liquid layout for my jekyll blog to output data from Webmention.io (for webmentions)
* UX - adding tags to every article and showing them in article headers
* UX - adding subheads to new articles from here on out
