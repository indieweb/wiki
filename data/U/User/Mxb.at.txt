== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Max, I'm a frontend developer and designer based in Vienna, Austria. I've been building stuff on the web for the last 12 years, focusing on CSS, Javascript, Accessibility and Performance. I also like to write about web development on [https://mxb.dev/blog/ my blog].
