'''A few things I care about'''
<br/>WordPress (I’ve been using it since 2007)
<br/>Website speed + performance
<br/>Hosting, email, and keeping sites reliable
<br/>Simple, practical tools that save time

I’m Dustin. I run a couple internet businesses and spend a big chunk of my week in the WordPress weeds—troubleshooting plugins, improving site speed, and helping websites feel faster and easier to maintain.

I use my site to share what I’m learning in public: notes from building, lessons from shipping projects, and occasional deep-dives on performance and the “boring” website stuff that actually matters.
