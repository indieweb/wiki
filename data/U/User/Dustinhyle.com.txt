'''A few things I care about'''
<br/>WordPress (I’ve been using it since 2007)
<br/>Website speed + performance
<br/>Hosting, email, and keeping sites reliable
<br/>Simple, practical tools that save time

I’m Dustin. I run a couple internet businesses and spend a big chunk of my week in the WordPress weeds—troubleshooting plugins, improving site speed, and helping websites feel faster and easier to maintain.

My background is in IT (everything from desktop support to network/server engineering and infrastructure management), so I tend to obsess over the “boring” parts that keep a site stable: security, performance, and deliverability—especially when email or hosting issues quietly break things behind the scenes.

These days, I’m focused on building a more hands-on kind of managed WordPress hosting with Iridium Hosting, plus supporting local service businesses through 509Brand. I like simple systems, clear checklists, and practical fixes that make the internet feel less frustrating.
