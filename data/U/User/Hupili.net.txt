== My Setup ==

Silos I'm using regularly:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Renren, the large OSN in China. It's a Facebook like model: http://www.renren.com/
* SinaWeibo, ("weibo" in Chinese means "micro-blog"). It's a twitter like model: http://weibo.com/
* TecentWeibo. It's another micro-blogging service in China. Due to the broad production line of Tecent, TecentWeibo has some unique access point (e.g. WeChat from a mobile device). http://t.qq.com/

Aggregation and distribution points on my site:

* The aggregated status update from those silos: http://hupili.net/feeds/all.xml  . It's currently a mix of all materials. I'll separate the English and Chinese messages later.

Following is a visualization of my silo setups.

== About IndieAuth ==

(I have not find a proper location for this piece of comments; feel free to move)

The IndieAuth model is interesting. 
I think the essence is to decouple ID provider and ID verifier. 
The two components were often binded in previous models, which is not natural in our real life. 
Consider a real-world example: 
I want to make friends with '''A''' and '''A''' want to make sure whether I'm '''me''' before that. 
It's very absurd for me to show '''A''' my '''ID''' card. 
Instead, there may be a '''B''' who has verified '''me''' some time ago
(by looking at my ID or through a longer chain of trust).
In '''B''' 's mind, my '''ID''' and my '''face''' have been binded. 
Using this information, '''B''' can come to tell '''A''' that I am indeed '''me'''.
