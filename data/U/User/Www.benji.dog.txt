Hi, my name is {{benji}} and I'm a software developer from Ecuador ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨. My personal site is built with [[Eleventy]]. The site supports [[webmentions]] using GitHub actions to send on every build and checks for new webmentions once a day using a similar approach.

== Projects ==

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-micropub lilypad: serverless micropub and media endpoint] ===
Serverless [[Micropub/Servers|Micropub Endpoint]] deployed to [[Netlify]]. The project linked above makes it possible to do a one click deploy of a micropub endpoint and most of the logic lives in this serparate [https://github.com/benjifs/micropub micropub] library I wrote.

Content is added to either a [[GitHub]] or [[GitLab]] repository but it can be extended to use different places to store data by following the same structure of [https://github.com/benjifs/github-store github-store] or [https://github.com/benjifs/gitlab-store gitlab-store].

Designed to work with [[Eleventy]] but has also been tested with [[Hugo]].

Supported content types:
* [[articles]]
* [[bookmarks]]
* [[likes]]
* [[notes]]
* [[reply]]
* [[rsvp]]
* [[repost]]
* [[photo]]
* [[watch]]
* [[read]]
* [[listen]]
* [[play]]

Passes all [[micropub.rocks]] [https://micropub.rocks/implementation-reports/servers/908/WOtxHPKoqhnAvjq9A0rT tests].

=== [https://sparkles.sploot.com sparkles: micropub client] ===
A [[Micropub/Clients| Micropub client]] built as a [[Progressive_Web_App|Progressive Web App (PWA)]]. Uses [https://www.omdbapi.com/ OMDb API] to search for movies when creating [[watch]] posts. Actively being developed but should be stable.

[https://www.benji.dog/articles/sparkles/ sparkles: release notes]

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-webmentions marshmallow: serverless webmentions] ===
Serverless webmention receiver that was built to run on [[Netlify]]. It uses [https://docs.netlify.com/build/data-and-storage/netlify-blobs/ Netlify Blobs] to store webmention data. It has built in functions for importing data from [[webmention.io]] as well as exporting all data for portability and backup purposes.

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-indieauth barnacle: serverless indieauth] ===
Serverless [[authorization-endpoint|IndieAuth]] and [[token-endpoint|Token Endpoint]]. It is meant to run on [[Netlify]] but could be customized to work on other platforms as it uses [https://github.com/benjifs/indieauth @benjifs/indieauth] for all the actual logic and that can be integrated into other projects.

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/umbrella umbrella: 11ty starter project] ===
A starter project for [[Eleventy]] that has [[Micropub]], [[IndieAuth]], and [[Webmention|Webmentions]] built in using [[Netlify]] and [[serverless|serverless functions]]. It is meant to be a simple way to get started with some IndieWeb [[building blocks]].

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/eleventy-plugin-shortlinks eleventy-plugin-shortlinks] ===
Not really IndieWeb related but was inspired by the implementations discussed in [[permashortlink]] and [[newbase60]]. The [[short-domain]] for my site is [http://bnj.pw bnj.pw].

Sample:
* [http://bnj.pw/b5N70 bnj.pw/b5N70] redirects to [https://benji.dog/articles/sparkles benji.dog/articles/sparkles]

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/netlify-webmentions-plugin netlify-webmentions-plugin] ===
This [[Netlify]] plugin automates sending webmentions on every build. It keeps track of the latest item that webmentions were sent to prevent the same post sending multiple posts.

== Itches ==
* [[IndieAuth]] implementation that uses [[push_notification|push notifications]].
* <s>Create an interface for my script that imports [[Letterboxd]] RSS feeds.</s>
** '''Done''': https://github.com/benjifs/letterboxd-import
