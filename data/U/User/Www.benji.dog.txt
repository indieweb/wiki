Hi, my name is {{benji}} and I'm a software developer from Ecuador 🇪🇨. My personal site is built with [[Eleventy]]. The site supports [[webmentions]] using GitHub actions to send on every build and checks for new webmentions once a day using a similar approach.

== Projects ==

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/micropub micropub endpoint] ===
Serverless [[Micropub/Servers|Micropub Endpoint]] deployed to [[Netlify]]. Content is added to either a [[GitHub]] or [[GitLab]] repository. Designed to work with [[Eleventy]] but has also been tested with [[Hugo]].

Supported content types:
* [[articles]]
* [[bookmarks]]
* [[likes]]
* [[notes]]
* [[reply]]
* [[rsvp]]
* [[watch]]

=== [https://sparkles.sploot.com sparkles] ===
A [[Micropub/Clients| Micropub client]] built as a [[Progressive_Web_App|Progressive Web App (PWA)]]. Uses [https://www.omdbapi.com/ OMDb API] to search for movies when creating [[watch]] posts. Actively being developed but should be stable.

[https://www.benji.dog/articles/sparkles/ sparkles: release notes]

=== [https://github.com/benjifs/eleventy-plugin-shortlinks eleventy-plugin-shortlinks] ===
Not really IndieWeb related but was inspired by the implementations discussed in [[permashortlink]] and [[newbase60]]. The [[short-domain]] for my site is [http://bnj.pw bnj.pw].

Sample:
* [http://bnj.pw/b5N70 bnj.pw/b5N70] redirects to [https://benji.dog/articles/sparkles benji.dog/articles/sparkles]

== Itches ==
* [[IndieAuth]] implementation that uses [[push_notification|push notifications]].
* Create an interface for my script that imports [[Letterboxd]] RSS feeds.
