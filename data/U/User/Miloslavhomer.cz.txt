Hello, my name is Milo Homer and I am a hacker.

Right now, I am working as a senior application security specialist at Kiwi.com. I am trying to protect our apps and their supporting infrastructure. I am working with a wide range of technologies, including (but not limited to): GitLab, Cloudflare, DataDog, Okta, GCP, Kubernetes or Terraform. I am also managing our hackerone public bug bounty program.

Up to 2022, I worked full-time as a penetration tester, which started in early 2017. I mainly worked on web applications, android applications, REST APIs and infrastructure. Uncommon projects had me dealing with Kubernetes, OAuth2 and code review. However, details of all our projects are under NDA, so there is no further info for you.

Coming from a cryptography background, I managed to up my tech skills a bit and completed OSCP. I am most proficient in Python; however, due to the nature of pentesting, I know bits from various languages (C, C++, Java, SQL, Bash, Go, PHP, Ruby, VBA, Javascript etc.). I am more comfortable with Linux than Windows.
