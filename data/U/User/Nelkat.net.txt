My name is Eleanor K Cass.  I usually go by Nell. 

I live in a small town on the borders of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  

I'm a volunteer tutor at one of the local libraries. 

I have been lurking around the chat room via Matrix for months now.  

Thank you very much for all the help! Woo!

I have a new phrase and I hope you will enjoy it "I'm feeling very Generation 4 right now."  :):)
