== my IndieWeb setup ==

* https://chrisruppel.com is my home base. I tend to use subdomains so that I can experiment freely without tying everything into one huge codebase or tech stack.
** My website has an [[h-card]] in the global footer (Jan 2016)
** My blog posts are marked up with [[h-entry]] (Jun 2016)
** My blog posts can receive and display [[Webmention|Webmentions]] (Apr 2018)
* https://drinks.chrisruppel.com holds recipes for cocktails. Each cocktail is an [[h-recipe]] (Dec 2022).

== IndieWeb Talks ==
* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/levelten/3784857759/ Making Sense of the Semantic Web], my first-ever conference presentation was partly about Microformats and [https://gmpg.org/xfn/ XFN]
