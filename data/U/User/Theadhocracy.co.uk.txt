Hi 👋 I'm {{murray}}. I'm new to the IndieWeb community and just getting set up, but have been writing on a personal site since the mid-2000s. I currently live in London, working as a Front-End Engineer. My site is a Jamstack mashup, built with GatsbyJS and hosted on Netlify, whilst using Craft as a headless CMS. That presents some interesting problems to solve 😁

== Itches ==

* Work out a better way of dealing with outgoing [[webmentions]]. The plan: an automated system that won't send _everything_ each time I rebuild the site, only new or updated pages.
* Take ownership of received webmentions, pulling them into the Craft database. Hopefully the first step in creating a more inclusive commenting system.
* (the longshot) A MicroPub endpoint/plugin for Craft, so that I can begin diversifying how I generate posts, notes, and begin integrating other services.
* Diversify current "Journal" to be more than just personal blog posts
** Should include check-ins, beer/food journal, trips, event attendance, microblogs, and more
** New backend content schema ✅
** Port existing experiments across to new schema
** Additional Journal views for month/year/day
* Experiment with using NextJS to power protected pages
* Create a record collection microsite
* Create a beer journal microsite

== Now Scratched ==

* Setup an [[h-card]] on my site ✅
* Add microformat markup to my pages ✅
* Rework current categorisation system ✅
* Add search functionality to website ✅
* Get inbound [[webmentions]] working ✅
* Use webmentions to power cross-linking of articles and notes ✅
