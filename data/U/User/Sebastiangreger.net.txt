<span class="p-url">https://sebastiangreger.net</span> has been my home on the web since January 2005, and gradually indiewebified since 2013. The current site is running on [[Kirby|Kirby 3]] since 2019, after operating on Wordpress for many years - a step that finally brought back the joy of designing and developing for it (trading the complexity of Wordpress for the flexibility of Kirby).

As a testbed and proof-of-concept for my work on privacy-centred design, the site's frontend operates entirely without third-party requests; all resources are loaded locally, cookie-free and without tracking the user.

== Kirby setup ==
The Indieweb features of my website are powered by a suite of Kirby plugins:
* [https://github.com/sebastiangreger/kirby3-sendmentions kirby3-sendmentions] sends out Webmentions for newly published posts
* [https://github.com/sebastiangreger/kirby3-commentions kirby3-commentions] is a comment system that treats incoming Webmentions as comments (no "backfeed" of social media commentary)
* [https://github.com/sebastiangreger/kirby3-selfauth kirby3-selfauth], an adaptation of [[Selfauth]] that provides a stand-alone implementation of IndieAuth (allows authentication to other websites by logging in to Kirby)
* a not-yet-released (WIP) Micropub plugin allows me to post new content via Micropub
* a bespoke reader and bookmarking setup (private project for the forseeable future) serves as my preferred RSS/Twitter client and bookmark manager: a set of cronjob-powered spaghetti code in Python, integrated with PHP as Kirby plugins

I selectively [[POSSE]] to Twitter at [https://twitter.com/sebastiangreger @sebastiangreger], currently [[manual_until_it_hurts|manual until it hurts]] or until I find the time to eventually port [https://sebastiangreger.net/projects/sg-syndication my old Wordpress plugin] to Kirby.

== Archived projects ==
I no longer use, maintain or develop my custom Wordpress plugins:
* [https://sebastiangreger.net/projects/sg-syndication sg-syndication] - a POSSE syndication plug-in for WordPress
* [https://sebastiangreger.net/projects/sg-bookmarks sg-bookmarks] - the attempt to create a Delicious-like personal bookmark management into WordPress
