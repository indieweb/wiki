== Setup ==
My current website is built with [[Kirby]].

Previously I'd a custom built CMS using [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]] for interactions and short-form content. There also included a separately-maintained blog using [[Jekyll]].

== Posting ==
I've customised the CMS for short-form posts, photos, bookmarks, likes and check-ins. This also facilitates sending and syndication to other platforms including Twitter.

On my old website posting via Micropub was possible for a select range of use cases including short-form text or photo posts, check-ins via [[OwnYourSwarm]] and Instagram via [[OwnYourGram]]. Work is in progress to have similar features on my [[Kirby]] built website.

The posting interface provides a target URL field which allows for sending Webmentions to other websites or platforms like Twitter via [[Bridgy]] support.

== Skills ==
I'm most experienced and comfortable with the following skills and technologies:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla/ES6+ and some VueJs), some PHP
* WordPress, Laravel
* Web Accessibility
* Web Performance

== IndieWeb projects ==
Alongside maintaining my own websites these are some other IndieWeb-related projects I have created or contributed to:

* [[IndieWebGuides]]
* [https://hwclondon.co.uk/ HWC London] contribution via GitHub

=== toDo ===
* Redevelop my Micropub endpoint and setup IndieLogin
* Self-hosted Microsub reader/server
