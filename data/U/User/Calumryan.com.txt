== Setup ==
Custom built CMS using [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]] for interactions and short-form content. There is also a separately-maintained blog using [[Jekyll]].

== Posting ==
The custom built CMS has a responsive interface including fields for writing short-form posts, photos, bookmarks, likes and check-ins. This also facilitates sending and syndication to other platforms including Twitter.

Posting via Micropub is possible for a select range of use cases including short-form text or photo posts, check-ins via [[OwnYourSwarm]] and Instagram via [[OwnYourGram]].

The posting interface provides a target URL field which allows for sending Webmentions to other websites or platforms like Twitter via [[Bridgy]] support.
