== Intro ==
I am an information technologist whose personal site is [https://vanderwal.net vanderwal.net] that I've run since 1997 and blogging on since the very tail end of 2000. I also have a more professional blog at [https://personalinfocloud.com personalinfocloud.com - Personal InfoCloud]. I coined the term [https://vanderwal.net/folksonomy.html folksonomy] among other framing concepts. I was a member of the Web Standards Project (WaSP) from 2003.

== Websites ==

My [https://vanderwal.net vanderwal.net] site is my personal site which has my [https://vanderwal.net/random/ Off the Top] blog that I've posted to since very late 2000. In 2001 I built my own CMS in PHP, which the site still runs on. In 2002 the site was redesigned to move out of table layouts to full CSS layout. 

I have a more professional focussed site, [https://personalinfocloud.com Personal InfoCloud] that just moved to WordPress this year from SquareSpace (and prior to that, starting in 2003, TypePad). 

Some of my content I syndicate out to Medium [https://medium.com/@vanderwal vanderwal @ Medium].
