Indiweb setup (as of 2017 05 29)

Recently wrote an indieweb-friendly CMS called [https://gogs.eli.li/eli_oat/Pneumatic-Post Pneumatic Post], which I use to power my personal website. Good for notes, articles, and replies. Pretty solid webmention support, but the whole setup is still a work in progress.

Interested in creating an indieweb [http://timehop.com Timehop] clone, a tool to surface what was posted on this day in previous years.

Also interested in helping to document stuff.
