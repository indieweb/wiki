Hi! I'm the Founder of Market Chemistry, based in Austin, Texas. I help startups raise capital, tell their story, and build investor trust. Here's a link to my website [https://catediaz.com/ CateDiaz.com] where I write about startups and marketing.

== About Me ==

My expertise lives at the intersection of storytelling, systems, and private investments.

I focus on work that drives momentum: building key narratives, establishing credibility, and designing leveraged systems that connect founders with the right capital partners.

Outside of work, I love racquet sports, traveling whenever I can, and have a long-running interest in menswear. I live with my wife and our dog, Echo.

We got married in 2024 and celebrated with a fire dancer and a live paella cook. I’m always chasing memorable experiences, and I recently crossed “ride a hot air balloon” off my bucket list.

I post on a WordPress blog here every few weeks https://catediaz.com/blog/
