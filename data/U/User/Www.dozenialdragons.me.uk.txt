== Good Morning! ==

I never intended to make an account here, but then I added [[selfauth]] to my website, got very excited, and had to use it for something.

== Itches ==
* Do more slash pages, the one I most want to do is /canon
* Sort out the styling for quotebacks
* Fix styling for my selfauth
* Have some more colours on my site
