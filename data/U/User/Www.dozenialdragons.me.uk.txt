== Good Morning! ==

I never intended to make an account here, but then I added [[selfauth]] to my website, got very excited, and had to use it for something.

== How I Got Here ==

I think it was {{capjamesg}} who introduced me to the indieweb – not personally, through his website! I thought it was cool at the time, because I had never been a fan of the commercial web, but I didn't do anything about it, because it looked complicated to set up a website. Then, in 2024, I started work on a website, and it snowballed from there! It feels funny 'joining' a community that I haven't met – certainly a first for me.

== Itches ==
* Do more slash pages, the one I most want to do is /canon
* Fix styling for my selfauth

== Done ==
* Sort out the styling for quotebacks
* Have some more colours on my site
