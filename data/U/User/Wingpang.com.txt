== Introduction ==
I was born during a tropical cyclone in Hong Kong to a pair of incredibly supportive parents and blessed with two siblings who are equally as supportive. When I was around six years old, my father bravely uprooted the whole family to come to Australia.

One thing I love about being a Sydney-sider is the amount of cultural diversity we have. Cultural diversity benefits not only our social, but also professional lives.

We’re all shaped by the cultures we’re raised in, but being in a multicultural environment gives us the means to view ourselves outside of a microcosm. It gives rise to innovative ideas from new perspectives.

With the world being more digitally interconnected than ever before, I’m interested in creating designs that suit a modern, global citizen and solving problems that come along the way.

I’m bilingual in Cantonese, fluent in Mandarin and at an intermediate level in Japanese.

== Websites ==
My main website is [https://wingpang.com wingpang.com], where I have some of my (outdated) design portfolio pieces and illustrations. The fun part of my website is on [https://wingpang.com/notes wingpang.com/notes], where I microblog and use it like I would with other social media. As of 2027-07-10, I'm using [[Indiekit]] by [[User:Paulrobertlloyd.com | Paul Robert Lloyd]] on an [[Eleventy]] static website hosted through [[Cloudflare Pages]].

I also created [https://indieweb.guide indieweb.guide] as a university project in 2024.
