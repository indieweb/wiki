Personal site uses WordPress since 2005, hence using the webmention suite/plugins (and being extremely thankful for the work that gets put into that).
Would always prefer ProcessWire or Kirby CMS, though.
Wrestles with TYPO3 since 2005, but thats a hate/love relation.

No matter the CMS, I'm more interested in Front-End, HTML, CSS and progressively enhanced JengaScript and creating accessible and resilient sites for all users.
