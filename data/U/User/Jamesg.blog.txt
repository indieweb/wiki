== About Me ==
In my spare time, I like to read about the internet and coffee. I came across the IndieWeb in late 2019 and have just came back to explore the topic. I'm especially interested in taking more control over my data and seeing how I can syndicate data I create across different platforms.

== Itches ==

* Figure out how to effectively share my coffee data on my site
* Show archives from my exercise data
* Check out other IndieWeb sites for inspiration
* Change domains to jamesg.blog (to get away from a Google TLD)
* Deploy sourcehut mirror script to a server

== Timeline ==

Here is a timeline of how my personal websites have evolved:

* Early 2019: Set up a personal website using Carrd.co, a static website generator.
* Early 2019: Created a WordPress site so that I could start hosting blog posts.
* Mid 2019: Moved to Squarespace because I saw an aesthetically pleasing template that looked apt for my portfolio.
* Early 2020: Decided that I needed to take control of my data. I created a site using React.js and Next.js to build my expertise using these technologies.
* Mid 2020: Realized my site was over-engineered. I rebuilt my personal website using Jekyll.
* Mid 2020: Still working on my personal website.
