== James (capjamesg) ==

Hello there! I am James. I started writing about coffee and the IndieWeb in mid-2020. Today, I write a lot about the web, moments of joy, stories, and more.

I co-host [https://hwclondon.co.uk Homebrew Website Club London / Europe] with {{marksuth}}. I was a co-chair on the W3C [[Social Web Incubator Community Group]].

== My Website ==

My website is available at [https://jamesg.blog jamesg.blog].

=== Technologies ===

My site uses:

* [https://github.com/capjamesg/aurora Aurora] as my static site generator.
* [https://github.com/capjamesg/jamesql JameSQL] for my search service.

== Other sites ==

I also run:

* [https://airportpianos.org Airport Pianos]

== Active IndieWeb community projects ==

I run:

* [[Cali]], the Etherpad archiving bot.
* https://jamesg.blog/hwc-notes, a site that provides RSS feeds with all IndieWeb event notes archived on the wiki.

I maintain:

* [https://github.com/capjamesg/indieweb-utils IndieWeb Utils], a Python package with IndieWeb-related utilities.

I help maintain:

* [https://github.com/microformats/mf2py mf2py], the Python microformats parser.
