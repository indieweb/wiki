I believe the Indieweb project is a stepping stone to a Completely distributed network.

== Itches ==

* become [[offline_first| offline first]] centric
* go [[green_computing| green computing]]
* creating a [[mindmap]]
* getting other people to to join the [[indieweb]] movement


== Cloud computing / hosting ==
* <s>I have started to move my website off [[GitHub_Pages]] to [[Linode]]'s s3 '''completed'''</s>
* <s>I have started to set up a [[Linode]]'s [[VPS]] to host my own [[git]] [[repository]] with [[Gitea]] because I am hitting [[GitHub]] free limits '''almost completed'''</s> I am setting up my own [[home_server|homelab]] to host [[Gitea]]
* <s>moving my static data from [[Linode]]'s s3 to [[backblaze_b2]] because of [[Linode]]'s s3 cost.</s> turns out I need to move my websites back to [[Linode]]'s s3 because [[backblaze_b2]]'s s3 does not support [[CNAME]]. I am still host my larger files on b2.
* I am using [[CloudFlare]] for [[Content_delivery_network|CDNing]]

The cost of cloud compute like [[Amazon_EC2|aws ECS]] and [[Linode]]'s VPN is not worth the money, building a [[home_server|homelab]] is going to give me more bang for my buck.

Also known as [[multi-site_indieweb]]

I use [[Jekyll]] as my website generator

* I have parts of my website that are updated infrequently
* I host larger binary blobs (videos, 3D models)
