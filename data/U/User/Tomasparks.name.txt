I believe the Indieweb project is a stepping stone to a Completely distributed network.

== Itches ==

* move website to [[Amazon Web Services]]

===  Offline/asynchronous mode ===

* I am trying to come up with a way to go [[offline]] while I can [[sync| asynchronously]] upload/download stuff. (think: dial-up Internet/BBS)
* I own a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5 | Psion 5mx Pro] (16Mb) NOT running Linux

=== voice comments ===

* years ago I ported a java applet to [[wordpress]] that created voice comments using the Speex codec.
* since [[Opus]] has become the default audio codec for the web, I been relooking into the idea.

=== Sharding my website ===

I use [[Jekyll]] as my website generator

* I have parts of my website that are updated infrequently
* I host larger binary blobs (videos, 3D models)
* I have themes for different section of my website

==== Website Sections ====
* main (blog, about me) - Dynix theme
* retro space sim (webgl/X3D game) - dev blog: labnotebook theme
* minatures (papercraft models) - labnotebook theme
* notes - PDA-like theme
* gallery ([[photos]]) - wood theme?
