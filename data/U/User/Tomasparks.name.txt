I believe Indieweb project is a stepping stone to a Completely distributed network.

== Itches ==

===  Offline/asynchronous mode ===

* I am trying to come up with a way to go offline while I can asynchronously upload/download stuff.
* think: dial-up Internet/BBS

=== voice comments ===

* years ago I ported a java applet to [[wordpress]] that created voice comments using the speex codec.
* since [[Opus]] has become the default audio codec for the web, I been relooking into the idea.

=== Sharding my website ===

I use [[Jekyll]] as my website generator

* I have parts of my website that are updated infrequently
* I host larger binary blobs (videos, 3D models)
* I have themes for different section of website
