Hello! I'm Daniel or Dan (your preference). I've been writing on the web about my interests since at least 2004. I'm a digital accessibility specialist by trade, working in higher education. When I'm not working I'm exploring my creative pursuits in illustration, animation, web development and games design. I also keep an allotment for some much needed headspace.

== My Website ==
My current website is hosted at https://straydogstrut.co.uk and remains focused on my interests and my reflections.

My earliest experience of web development was Windows Notepad, Microsoft Frontpage, and a Lycos Tripod website that I can no longer remember the name of.

However, I've had a personal blog under the '''straydogstrut''' identity since 2004, initially on Blogger then later Wordpress, both the hosted and self-hosted versions. I formally purchased the domain name in August 2008.

My most active years were 2004 through 2007, and again in 2015 - 2019. However, I stopped blogging entirely in 2022, before rediscovering the personal web in 2024, when I briefly relaunched my website with Eleventy, then Micro.blog, then Grav.. and finally Statamic. It took some time for me to find the right fit(!)

=== Technology ===
My website is built using [[Statamic]] and deployed from [[GitHub]] thanks to [https://forge.laravel.com/ Laravel Forge].

The look and feel of my site is a very heavily customised implementation of the [https://statamic.com/starter-kits/statamic/starters-creek Starter's Creek Starter Kit]
