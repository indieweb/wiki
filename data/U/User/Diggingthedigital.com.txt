== Introduction ==

I've been online since 1994 and publishing on the web ever since. From dinky personal websites to various blogs, both corporate, personal and professional. Digging the Digital is my latest blog where I'm researching this whole IndieWeb thing, how to deal with my online presence in the wake of all the social silo's and still have fun as a blogger, digging the web as it should be.
I wrote a book on the history of the Dutch blogosphere, capturing the era 1995 - 2005. Bloghelden (Blogging Heroes) is available as a [https://github.com/frankmeeuwsen/bloghelden Github repository] for anyone to fork and play around with.

==Indieweb setup (of sorts...)==
* Digging the Digital ran on Jekyll at Github Pages (and available as [https://github.com/frankmeeuwsen/DTD-Blog repo]) from 2016 untill february 28th 2019.
* Digging the Digital now runs on WordPress. 
* Sometimes blogposts are written locally in Markdown.
* Use WordPress Webmention plugin as webmention endpoint.
* Use my site as an authentication-hub for IndieAuth.
* Use various Micropub services like [[Quill]] and [[Omnibear]] to post to my site
* Use hosted [[Aperture]] to store some readingmaterial
* Use hosted [[Monocle]] and [[Together]] to read stuff

==Stuff to work on at IndieWebCamp Utrecht==

* Work on an [[OPML]] importer for [[Aperture]]
* Improve connections with [[Bridgy]] and networks like [[Mastodon]]

==Itches (Runway stuff)==

* Make better and more deliberate use of [[Microformats]] on my site
* Make better use of [[webmentions]] and the presentation of received webmentions
* Make my homepage like-able through webmentions. (Thanks [https://sonniesedge.co.uk Charlie] for the inspiration)
* Make better use of my own site as a central hub for all my online work and communication
* Improve my [[h-card]]
* Improve the presentation of various post types in my theme (especially the [[Instagram#PESOS Instagram]] posts)
* Separate [[notes]], [[bookmarks]] and [[likes]] from longer-form writing through a menu and filtering on the frontpage. 
* Improve the presentation of [https://diggingthedigital.com/2899-2/ multiple Instagram photos]
* Show random or fixed twitter:image metatag for shorter notes
* Make my list of best articles more dynamic and based on tags or categories
* Find out how to better automate bookmarks and likes to my site
* Improve the presentation of webmentions and comments
* Get better notifications for incoming webmentions and comments

==Longer term (Up in the sky)==
* Think and write about the IndieWeb from a user perspective and how to transfer it to a new audience as an alternative for what is the status quo now. 
* As a longtime fan of Dave Winer's work and thinking, I'd like to find out how his work and code relates to the Indieweb.
* Break free of the ''trendy du jour'' WordPress theme and find some weird funky way to show my site.
* Add Runkeeper data as a post kind
* Import all the old blogposts from punkey.com
* Help out with improving UX/UI ideas for indieweb building blocks and make them more user-friendly
* Import [[Switch|Nintendo Switch]] playing time as posts

==Figured out==

* Make webmentions selfhosted
* Move from GH Pages to Digital Ocean or another trustworthy hostingparty (went for the latter, thanks Remkus!)
