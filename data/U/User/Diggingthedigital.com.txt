== Introduction ==

I've been online since 1994 and publishing on the web ever since. From dinky personal websites to various blogs, both corporate, personal and professional. Digging the Digital is my latest blog where I'm researching this whole IndieWeb thing, how to deal with my online presence in the wake of all the social silo's and still have fun as a blogger, digging the web as it should be.
I wrote a book on the history of the Dutch blogosphere, capturing the era 1995 - 2005. Bloghelden (Blogging Heroes) is available as a [https://github.com/frankmeeuwsen/bloghelden Github repository] for anyone to fork and play around with.

==Indieweb setup (of sorts...)==
* Digging the Digital ran on Jekyll at Github Pages (and available as [https://github.com/frankmeeuwsen/DTD-Blog repo]) from 2016 untill february 28th 2019.
* Digging the Digital now runs on WordPress. 
* All blogposts are written locally in Markdown.
* Use WordPress Webmention plugin as webmention endpoint.
* Use my site as a micropub for IndieAuth.

==Itches==

* Make better and more deliberate use of Microformats on my site
* Wrapping my head around the Webmentions philosophy and how it actually works.
* Make webmentions selfhosted
* Move from GH Pages to Digital Ocean or another trustworthy hostingparty
* Make better use of my own site as a central hub for all my online work and communication
* Think and write about the IndieWeb and how to transfer it to a new audience as an alternative for what is the status quo now. 
* As a longtime fan of Dave Winer's work and thinking, I'd like to find out how his work and code relates to the Indieweb.
