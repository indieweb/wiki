I’m Emma Larson. I help patent litigators create real options in their careers, usually by guiding them to multiple strong offers and helping them approach interviews with clarity and confidence. I write about the practical side of career moves, the human side of ambition, and what it looks like to build a good life at the same time as a demanding career.

Before I joined Freshwater Counsel as a partner, I worked in software sales and learned how to build repeatable processes for solving human problems. Now I use that same approach in legal recruiting, with a focus on being direct, thoughtful, and discreet.

When I’m not working, I’m usually thinking about family, time, and the kind of freedom you can build with steady choices.
