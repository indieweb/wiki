<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>[[h-entry]] <code>using</code> property</dfn>''' is a way to show what software was used to [[create]] a [[post]].</span> This could be anything from the name of your [[CMS]], to a [[Micropub]] [[Micropub/Clients|client]] or word processor.

The word ‚Äúusing‚Äù is often seen in the surrounding text, and upgrading it from just text to a property would be a great example of [[text-first design]].

{{alert|The name <code>using</code> is currently just a placeholder name based on some collected prior art. It may not be descriptive enough to stand on its own inside a parsed microformat.}}

== Brainstorming ==

I would imagine the property to take several different values:

# The name of the software used, e.g. BBEdit.
# The URL of the software used, e.g. <nowiki>https://quill.p3k.io/</nowiki>.
# The [[h-app]] object giving information about the software used, e.g. both its name and URL.

As all microformat properties take a list of values, it is also possible to show multiple pieces of a publishing flow. Maybe you used [https://ia.net/writer/ iA Writer] to draft it and then [[Quill]] to submit it to your website. This could be added to a post‚Äôs HTML as:

<pre>Posted using
<a class="u-using h-app" href="https://ia.net/writer/">iA Writer</a> and
<a class="u-using h-app" href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a></pre>

Which would translate to a parsed [[microformats]] property:

<pre>"using": [
  {
    "value": "https://ia.net/writer/",
    "type": [ "h-app" ],
    "properties": {
      "name": [ "iA Writer" ],
      "url": [ "https://ia.net/writer/" ]
    }
  },
  {
    "value": "https://quill.p3k.io/",
    "type": [ "h-app" ],
    "properties": {
      "name": [ "Quill" ],
      "url": [ "https://quill.p3k.io/" ]
    }
  }
]</pre>

== Prior Art ==

Currently several IndieWeb sites are showing what tool was used to create a post, but non of them are currently giving this any parsable markup.

=== Aaron Parecki ===

On {{aaronpk}}‚Äôs posts‚Äô [[permalink]] pages there is an additional info box that shows to what internal [[feed]] it was published and by what tool. The tool here is a link:

<blockquote>Posted in [https://aaronparecki.com/notes /notes] using [https://quill.p3k.io/ quill.p3k.io]</blockquote>

=== Eddie Hinkle ===

On {{eddiehinkle.com}}‚Äôs posts‚Äô permalink pages the header is expanded (compared to the hme feed) with extra information such as [[weather]], [[u-syndication|syndication]], and what tool was used to post:

<blockquote>[https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/02/24/4/note/ Feb 24, 2018 8:45 AM] 47.03‚Ñâ üå´ [https://eddiehinkle.com/tag/homestead homestead] posted using [https://indigenous.abode.pub/ indigenous.abode.pub]</blockquote>

=== Tantek √áelik ===

On {{tantek}}‚Äôs posts‚Äô permalink pages the footer is expanded (compared to the home feed) from just the publishing date to also include the [[permashortlink]] and the software used to write the post:

<blockquote>09:45 on 2018-02-21 (ttk.me t4t32) using BBEdit</blockquote>

=== Sink ===

On {{martijnvdven}}‚Äôs [[Sink]] the posts‚Äô permalink pages display the [[IndieAuth]] Profile URL and the Micropub client associated with the post through its [[access token]]:

<blockquote><nowiki>By https://vanderven.se/martijn/, using https://omnibear.com</nowiki></blockquote>
