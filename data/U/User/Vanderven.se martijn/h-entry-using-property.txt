<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>[[h-entry]] <code>using</code> property</dfn>''' is a way to show what software was used to [[create]] a [[post]].</span> This could be anything from the name of your [[CMS]], to a [[Micropub]] [[Micropub/Clients|client]] or word processor.

The word ‚Äúusing‚Äù is often seen in the surrounding text, and upgrading it from just text to a property would be a great example of [[text-first design]].

{{alert|The name <code>using</code> is currently just a placeholder name based on some collected prior art. It may not be descriptive enough to stand on its own inside a parsed microformat.}}

== Functionality ==

I would imagine the property to take several different values:

# The name of the software used, e.g. BBEdit.
# The URL of the software used, e.g. <nowiki>https://quill.p3k.io/</nowiki>.
# The [[h-app]] object giving information about the software used, e.g. both its name and URL.

As all microformat properties take a list of values, it is also possible to show multiple pieces of a publishing flow. Maybe you used [https://ia.net/writer/ iA Writer] to draft it and then [[Quill]] to submit it to your website. This could be added to a post‚Äôs HTML as:

<pre>Posted using
<a class="u-using h-app" href="https://ia.net/writer/">iA Writer</a> and
<a class="u-using h-app" href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a></pre>

Which would translate to a parsed [[microformats]] property:

<pre>"using": [
  {
    "value": "https://ia.net/writer/",
    "type": [ "h-app" ],
    "properties": {
      "name": [ "iA Writer" ],
      "url": [ "https://ia.net/writer/" ]
    }
  },
  {
    "value": "https://quill.p3k.io/",
    "type": [ "h-app" ],
    "properties": {
      "name": [ "Quill" ],
      "url": [ "https://quill.p3k.io/" ]
    }
  }
]</pre>

== Property Name ==

* <code>using</code> seems like a good name based on the text-first designs we have seen. But when taken as a singular word on a parsed microformat it may lose a lot of meaning given by context. Is the [[h-entry]] using something?
* <code>via</code>, as seen in [[#Sebastiaan_Andeweg|the text-first design]] by {{sebsel}} and [[#Twitter|previously used by Twitter]], is another one that does clearly illustrate the current h-entry was obtained through some path, but may be a hat-tip to a person rather than the technical path.
* <code>authored-using</code> or <code>authored-with</code> would clearly identify the relation between the contents of the property and the h-entry. But could one say that the h-entry was ‚Äúauthored‚Äù by the [[author]] if it originated from a tool like [[OwnYourGram]]? Currently Micropub tools like that are often displayed on websites the same way as a more traditional [[editor]] like Quill.
* <code>generator</code> is another option, taken from the often seen <code><meta name="generator"></code> element. Like the way that element expresses what tool was used to author the entire web page, a property sharing that name would express it for the h-entry. (Many pages [https://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposal/meta_name%3Dgenerator_does_not_make_missing_alt_conforming#current_usage_of_meta_name.3Dgenerator_.28New.29 on generator usages] are deceptively old. Deceptively because even modern CMS like [[Hugo]] [https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/2850 will add the element].)
* <code>formatter</code>, this is apparently [https://www.metatags.org/meta_name_generator_or_name_formatter an alternative to <code>generator</code>].

== Prior Art ==

Currently several IndieWeb sites are showing what tool was used to create a post, but non of them are currently giving this any parsable markup.

=== Aaron Parecki ===

On {{aaronpk}}‚Äôs posts‚Äô [[permalink]] pages there is an additional info box that shows to what internal [[feed]] it was published and by what tool. The tool here is a link:

=== Eddie Hinkle ===

On {{eddiehinkle.com}}‚Äôs posts‚Äô permalink pages the header is expanded (compared to the hme feed) with extra information such as [[weather]], [[u-syndication|syndication]], and what tool was used to post:

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===

{{sebsel}} includes where a post originated from but only in the HTML, it is currently hidden through CSS. Unlike other examples his text design uses the word ‚Äúvia‚Äù rather than ‚Äúusing‚Äù:

<pre><footer class="post-meta cf">

=== Tantek √áelik ===

On {{tantek}}‚Äôs posts‚Äô permalink pages the footer is expanded (compared to the home feed) from just the publishing date to also include the [[permashortlink]] and the software used to write the post:

=== Pnut ===

[[pnut]] displays a ‚Äúvia Application‚Äù behind the publication date on hover. This label displays a name and also links to the application‚Äôs page:

=== Sink ===

On {{martijnvdven}}‚Äôs [[Sink]] the posts‚Äô permalink pages display the [[IndieAuth]] Profile URL and the Micropub client associated with the post through its [[access token]]:

=== Twitter ===

[[Twitter]] used to display ‚Äúvia Application‚Äù at the bottom of tweets, but this was removed back in 2012.
