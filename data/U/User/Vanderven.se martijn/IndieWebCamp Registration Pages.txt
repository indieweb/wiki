For [[IndieWebCamps]] we have started creating landing/registration pages at dedicated yearly subdomains. This started in 2016, since offline but still [https://github.com/indieweb/2016.indieweb.org available on GitHub].

These pages have also featured a way to sign-up to the events without relying on Indie RSVP. Meaning we are [[IndieWebCamp_Organizing#Why_is_there_a_high_bar_for_registering|lowering the bar for registering]]. Currently the ticketing system of choice is [[ti.to]].

If you are [[IndieWebCamp_Organizing|organising an IndieWebCamp]] in 2019, it is recommended you do the following:

== Getting on 2019.indieweb.org ==

For any of the following steps, do not hesitate to contact other organisers. A number of them can often be found inside [[discuss|the meta discussion channel]].

=== Create a landing page ===

This is done by opening a PR to [https://github.com/indieweb/2019.indieweb.org indieweb/2019.indieweb.org on GitHub] with the following:

# A folder of your city name containing only a <code>.gitignore</code> file inside the <code>data</code> folder.
# A copy of the previous held camp’s PHP file inside the <code>public</code> directory, renamed to your city name with the details inside updated:
#* There are a few variables on top for setting the city name and the dates.
#* There is a <code><tito-widget></code> custom HTML element that needs to be set to the correct URL. We follow the naming scheme <code>city-year</code>. Read on for information about setting up Tito.
#* Towards the end there is a <code><script></code> tag generating a map view. This needs to be updated with your venue’s address and coordinates.
# A copy of the previous held camp’s folder inside the <code> templates</code> directory, renamed to your city name. This then lets you update:
#* The sponsors, in <code>sponsors.php</code>.
#* The schedule, which should match the schedule on the wiki page, in <code>schedule.php</code>.
#* The landing page’s top navigation, in <code>nav.php</code>. If you aren’t adding or removing any page sections, this can be kept unchanged.

Take a look at [https://github.com/indieweb/2019.indieweb.org/pull/31/files the PR] for [[2019/Berlin|Berlin]] as a possible example.

=== Create a ti.to event ===

To create a ti.to event you will need to be added to the IndieWeb team. Contact one of the other organisers in [[discuss|the meta discussion channel]] to be added, or have them setup the event for you.

An event is created by doing the following:

# Duplicate an existing event to have a boiler plate. This is done by picking an event, going to <u>Customize</u>, and pressing <u>Duplicate this event</u>. You will end up with a duplicate, with Copy appended to the name.
# Make sure you are on the newly created duplicate and go to <u>Customize</u>. Under <u>Basics</u> change the title to follow the format “IndieWebCamp City Year”; update the <u>Event Start Date</u>, <u>Event End Date</u>, and <u>General location</u>; and tweak the <u>Event URL</u> to match the format “city-year”.
# Check <u>Tickets</u> to make sure only tickets your event will be using are enabled. Some events will have different price levels, or use tickets so people can contribute to the IndieWeb.
#* Usual tickets are Regular (for a small fee), Indie RSVP (for free, for people who have sent an [[rsvp]]), and Support the IndieWeb (for people who want to add to the price).
#* You can make an unlimited amount of tickets available and limit the amount of participants by limiting the capacity on activities.
