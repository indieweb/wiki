<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Notes from Virtual Homebrew Website Club, December 13, 2017</dfn>''' taken as the conversation flowed.</span> They don’t have any order to them other than time, and related items haven’t been grouped.

Attendance: {{martijnvdven}}, {{sgreger}}, and {{sknebel}}.

* {{sgreger}} presents https://sebastiangreger.net/temporary-tweetharvest-demo/
* Links also show avatars when he is logged in.
* Also Twitter handles of the people who have posted the link.
* Long term goal: highlight links posted by several people.
* No feature for tracking read articles, but CSS shows visited URLs.
* In development it can also follow RSS.
* Not yet MVP ready, when it is there will be a blogpost. Featuring insights on what he learned along the way.
* Pulls once an hour, and also orders the links per hour.
* Ideas born from Berlin readers session.
* Needs filtering. Seeing a lot of North American politics.
* {{sgreger}} also looking into [[Microsub]].
* Do you need curated personal feeds, or everything from the people you follow?
* {{martijnvdven}} has an application that is an IndieAuth client, IndieAuth provider, Token endpoint, and media endpoint, all on the same URL as the micropub endpoint.
* Hopefully launches a demo during the weekend that will allow anyone to login and post “stuff”.
* {{sknebel}} worked on his IRC bot during the IWC Austin weekend. The bot is able to generate things automatically like the list of upcoming homebrew website clubs on the homepage. It also does /live for livestreams.
* Still hasn’t launched the atom feeds he discussed in the last HWC.
* {{sgreger}} would like to see the ATOM feeds, as he hasn’t fully figured out how to subscribe to h-feeds.
* {{sknebel}} has moved away from the idea of proxying Granary RSS.
* {{sgreger}} tried running Granary locally, but he did not get it working on his live environment.
* These exercises could be made easier when we have Microsub, as the feed handling does not need to be figured out by everyone separately.
* {{martijnvdven}} could you use XRay now that it has feed support?
* {{sgreger}} doesn’t remember why he didn’t end up using it.
* {{sgreger}} wanted to use XRay but it wouldn’t pull basic data (like titles) from pages without microformats.
* Looked into XRay formats. Found a problem.

/ I had to disconnect for lag /

* Came back to gravatar discussion. {{sgreger}} found it very interesting. Shows that APIs can leak data even if you aren’t displaying it on the front-end.
* WordPress site was doing B2B where you had to enter your email address to get to a PDF download, but the PDF download link was accessible through the WP API.
* Akismet anti-spam also transmits your users IP adresses, which may be an issue.
* Gravatar is a stupid design - {{sknebel}}
* That was caused partly through the presentation at: http://torstenlandsiedel.de/2017/12/04/die-schmutzige-seite-von-wordpress/
* Discussing WordPress as memory warehouse. Personal data collection and owning the collections. - https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/brianna-privett-the-story-of-your-life-using-wordpress-as-your-memory-warehouse/
* Posting-by-email enabled to family can also log their memories.
* With WordPress you have tools that non-technical people can use that might be better than dumping everything in a FAcebook group.
* We are often missing the aspect to push just the “blogging for yourself” idea, rather than all the indieweb interconnected stuff.
* {{sgreger}} feels he is failing on engagement.
* “Launch a website, then you are IndieWeb” – {{martijnvdven}}
* You can also just write for yourself and put it public later.
* Once a website is live it is easier to make use of it. Make it easy to post.
* {{sgreger}} is happy he stuck with WordPress and not change to Hugo. Because he gets the whole posting flow with a nice editor and uploader from WordPress.
* He also should work on a list of arguments why it is worthwhile to stick with WordPress.
* Valuable because there are reasons for moving to other places.
* Looking at caching plugins. Has a very neat set-up now, but still needs to blog about it.
* Shoutout to the https://indieweb.org/2017/Austin/serendipity session
* {{sknebel}} has been thinking about how he can use WebPush notifications.
* Using it for authentication. Get a push notification with a link he has to click when logging in from a computer.
* This should be safe. When a device signs up for WebPush it uses a private key so that any payload send by the webapp is encrypted.
* Talking about web apps, and their installation flow.
* Using Chrome for Android’s add to homescreen does not make it an “app”, which means that custom launchers will not pick up on them.
* Twitter is picked up by Martijn’s custom launcher, as “Twitter Lite”.
* {{sknebel}} is wondering if he could use Chrome for Android’s password manager, which is lockable with a fingerprint, to make sign-up after the WebPush notification even more secure by still requiring a password but allowing him to enter the password with a single tap.
* What makes Twitter Lite into an application that gets picked up by the Launcher?
** Maybe it is a Streaming Web App? https://marketingland.com/google-app-streaming-web-of-apps-152449
** Or was that called Instant App? https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/index.html
** Maybe that it is a “display:standalone” in the web manifest.
** Clearly too much of this stuff exists.
* There is [https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/open-source/2017/how-we-built-twitter-lite.html a blog post by Twitter on how they built] [https://lite.twitter.com/content/lite-twitter/en.html Twitter Lite].
* Was comparing mobile.twitter.com to adactio.com. But {{adactio}}’s “minimal-ui” display didn’t work either. This is supported in the next version of Chrome for Android: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/12/06/chrome-63-adds-new-flags-page-prepares-chrome-home-ui-wide-rollout-apk-download/#Minimal_UI_for_web_apps
