----

* identities.
** Keeping the same handle on different silos.
** Specifically keeping different handles on different platforms for privacy.
*** {{martijnvdven}} knows several people – mostly from LGBT communities – that do this.
* Different between posts (articles?) and notes.
** jackjamieson had to distinguish by checking whether titles and contents were the same.
** [[User:Jgregorymcverry.com|J. Gregory McVerry]] notes how WordPress really wants you to add a title to everything you write.
*** This is especially important with syndication, because plugins & themes are very dependent on it.
* microformats in WordPress
** Converting themes to mf2.
** Yearly releases: GWG tries to add the mf2 (?). Most old mf1 has been stripped so parsers should no longer be confused (?).
* Meta Mumble discussion: registration, and adding comments to users.
* Had a discussion about handles and when we have different handles, why people have differnet handles, risk of handles getting stuck
* We then discussed how different themes handle microformats and what you can do to.
* I gave up on doing noterlive. I would have to have people set up and know voices better. —[[User:Jgregorymcverry.com|J. Gregory McVerry]]
** It's difficult to live-note a vHWC due to the open back-and-forth nature of the discussion. —{{schmarty}}
** Especially as I have lost a bit of typing speed. —[[User:Jgregorymcverry.com|J. Gregory McVerry]]
* Then we discussed who will be going to IWS
** International travel. Payment systems.
* Changes needed to Mumble tutorial
** add the audio testing. Need to delete files first
** Add the changing second button and push to talk button
** add the voice to chat turning off
* Book read posting
** {{gregorlove}} released https://indiebookclub.biz/
** ISBN linking (amazon, worldcat, ... author- or publisher webpage would be nice, but hard to do, since there's no good registry as far as we know)
** Martijn made his first post to indiebookclub.biz 
* We then talk to a bookmark discussion
** Jeremy asks is it just a boomark a like, etc
** Ancarda discusses how it is an archive for him. It was interesting 
* Micropub discussion
** There is a discussion of micropub endpoint and and how they work. 
** Micropub to github - {{Zegnat}}: https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github
** {{schmarty}} informs {{ancarda}} of his setup that does Micropub for a flatfile backend that runs through git, by running different githooks to generate a new build of his website.
*** (https://git.schmarty.net/schmarty/ssg-hook-publisher-php)
* Glitch as a platform for quickly writing and publishing HTML. With integration to GitHub. https://glitch.me/
* Getting citation data from Google scholar (to convert to h-cite).  Google Scholar does okay for journal articles but book chapters etc. tend to be pulled from author websites and the formatting is inconsistent. So Google's results are inconsistent too.
** Bibtex - parsing authors is difficult because the spec says authors should be separated by &, but in practice they are often separated by commas
