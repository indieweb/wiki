<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Notes from Virtual Homebrew Website Club, December 27, 2017</dfn>''' taken as the conversation flowed.</span> They don’t have any order to them other than time (roughly), and related items have been grouped.

Attendance: {{aaronpk}}, {{martijnvdven}}, and {{tantek}}.

* Both {{aaronpk}} and {{martijnvdven}} are working on [[2018-01-01-commitments|the New Year commitment]].
* {{aaronpk}} wants his likes and reposts automatically [[POSSE]]d to [[Twitter]].
* [[Quill]] was doing it for him before, but that doesn’t work from the iOS app. So he wants his [[Micropub]] server to do it instead.
* {{martijnvdven}} is working on a multi-user micropub endpoint that will allow anyone to use their own [[IndieAuth]] enabled website to login before posting.
* Using [https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth-client-php the PHP IndieAuth library] and trying very hard not to get distracted by it.
* {{tantek}} is looking at one of his main reasons for [[Facebook]]: [[birthdays|birthday information]].
* Where would you get [[notifications]] for birthdays on your own site?
* If a [[reader]] backend is creating a [[nicknames-cache|nicknames cache]], presumably it has access to [[birthday|birthday data]]. Could it feed those to the reader?
* {{martijnvdven}}: I would generate a feed of [[event|events]] out of my nickname cache.
* Difference between nickname cache and storage of people’s information (i.e. an [[address book]]). A nickname cache shouldn’t contain any information that isn’t fetched from a person’s homepage.
* What would an address book and nickname cache combination look like? Something like [[Google Contacts]] where contact information is also being updated from associated [[Google]] ([[Google_Plus|Plus]]) accounts?
* What would best describe Facebook’s Birthday UI?
** Feed of events?
** Feed of cards?
** The Facebook display isn’t really a feed display at all. It is more a display of person information sorted by birthday.
* {{tantek}} also brings up [[challenge|challenges]], as seen on [[Strava]].
* The idea being that anyone can issue a challenge for people to participate in.
* But also that participants should not have to do anything different from how they publish outside of the challenge.
** Example: if Alice issues a challenge for running, and Bob is posting his runs to his website, Bob should be able to participate in the challenge without changing anything about how his runs are posted.
* {{martijnvdven}} wonders if it would work in an [[RSVP]]-like way.
** Example: Bob would like to participate in Alice’s running challenge, and RSVPs to the challenge post to accept. Alice can now [[follow]] Bob’s feed to see his runs.
* After [[2017/Austin|IWC Austin]] an [[Etherpad]] was started for [https://etherpad.indieweb.org/the-upside-down-web ʇɥǝ ndsıpǝ poʍu ʍǝq]: an alphabet of web technologies that have fallen from grace.
* Takes inspiration from {{citation

}}.
* The alphabet needs to be finished.
* {{tantek}}, taking inspiration from D&D references in <i>Stranger Things</i>, would like to imagine all those technologies as “monsters”.
* There is an artist who would be able to draw each technology as an actual monster, <i>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Manual Monster Manual]</i>-style.
* {{martijnvdven}} would love to add actual [http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/intro.htm stat blocks] to them, and use them in a D&D set.
** Look, there is even [https://valloric.github.io/statblock5e/ a stat block Web Component]!
* {{aaronpk}} published a post after taking his code live:
