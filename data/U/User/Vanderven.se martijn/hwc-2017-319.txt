Attendance: {{ancarda}}, {{jeremycherfas}}, {{martijnvdven}}, {{sgreger}}, and {{sknebel}}.

* How to grow the community.
** Can we get people who show up to events like [[2017/Berlin]] to interact more actively in-between events? IRC? Blogging?
** How do we make the wiki seem more pleasant? Maybe wiki gardening is more important than just [[wikifying]] information.
*** Jeremy notes that many pages are marked <code><nowiki>{{stub}}</nowiki></code>. And even if he has contributed he never really knows when to take away the stub marker.
*** Jeremy also wondered what we do to attract people to weigh in on issues that are being tracked on the wiki. E.g. how are we asking people to comment on [[IndieAuth#how_to_should_include_endpoint_definition|Updating the IndieAuth How To]]?
* Some talk of [[2017/Berlin/bookmarks|the bookmarking and archiving session from Berlin]].
* [[exist.io]] - a service for aggregating data that is kept by silos.
** It is a silo itself, but does offer export options.
* [[reading.am]] - a service for tracking what you read online.
** Jeremy is looking for a way to get these reads onto his own site.
* [[Grav]] - Jeremy keeps hitting workflow problems with his Grav set-up, is considering cutting out a step by writing his own little application that generates the [[file-storage]] elements for a post without a need for the full PHP Grav back-end to run.
* [[sleep]] tracking
** Jeremy uses his GARMIN health tracking device.
** Sven would like to try some stuff but needs higher reliability than some phone apps have given him.
*** Considered just putting a webcam above his bed to create time lapses.
** Jeremy mentions someone who did his own tracking by an app of his own invention: the application would make a soft sound and prompt the person the confirm being awake. If they slept, the application would log the non-response to the prompt.
*** Together with tracking of their feelings this person was able to show their actual amount of hours slept did not correlate with how well they thought they slept.
** exist.io relates sleep data to whatever was done the day before.
** I would like to track this but would have some second thoughts about the privacy of telling [[silos]] when I sleep.
* Privacy
** What about Facebook’s People You May Know things? Jeremy brought up [https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691 How Facebook Figures Out Everyone You've Ever Met].
** What about sharing address books?
*** Case in Germany has said a woman needed to obtain consent from everyone in their address book before sharing it.
** How does Signal do this, where accounts are phone numbers?
*** try to keep data for as short as possible
*** Blog post explaining what doesn't work: https://signal.org/blog/contact-discovery/
*** Description of new design using Intel SGX secure hardware enclaves(!): https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/ 
** There are different degrees of how public some data is.
*** My phone number was already publicly displayed online before I started publishing it, and I don’t mind making it easier for people to find it by putting it on my site.
*** My [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identity_number_(Sweden) personal identity number] is also public data and available online for people who know where to look, but I do not feel like I have to make it easier to obtain.
* Event tooling
** Tool for more easily creating the IWC schedules?
** Event organisers should point out the schedule during the introductions, so people know where to find the etherpads for note-taking.
*** During the Berlin event Sven noted at least 1 person who thought they couldn’t take notes because they needed an account. Demo would solve this.
* {{dgold}} tracks his reading through IRC, but that’s just books.
* Brainstorming about a service that accepts reading.am’s webhook POST requests and forwards them as Micropub posts to an endpoint of the user’s choosing.
* Sven has noted a new form of POSSE/Data aggregation, people are making posts on their home pages of e.g. “all open source contributions made in October”.
** Example he linked: [https://anarc.at/blog/2017-04-29-free-software-activities-april-2017/ My free software activities, April 2017 - anarcat]
** He is interested in doing something like this himself, as it also gives a great way to keep track of things that still need to be followed up upon.
*** Side note: GitHub makes it impossible to see [https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/283 what issues you are subscribed to]. Subscribing isn’t even [https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/ an event in their API].
** Also see [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/ shurcool’s website] that lists all his GitHub activity.
* reading.am Firefox extension doesn’t work any more, was only available in the legacy system.
** [https://twitter.com/martijnvdven/status/930878863302971392 One tweet conversation] later the extensions were [https://github.com/reading-am put on GitHub]!
* What [[Micropub]] endpoints are out there and open sourced?
** What can we do to stop completely reinventing the wheel on this every time?
** Can parts of the endpoints be extracted and made useful for general consumption, or are they just always intertwined with the entire back-end of how posts are stored and treated?
** [[nanopub]] gets a shout-out.
* Never forget: just running your website is enough to be IndieWeb. Even without having all of the tech implemented! (There was a quote, I think from {{cweiske}}, that I can’t find now.)
