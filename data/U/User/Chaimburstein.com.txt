== How I Run My Sites ==
*RaspberryPi, Apache & Cloudflare Tunnel do most of the work
* Homepage was made by forking -  https://littlelink.io/
* My blog and all my other sites (mostly private) are run using TiddlyWiki which I edit on my ipad using the Quine App

== Itches ==
* POSSE from my blog - https://blog.chaimburstein.xyz 
* get webmentions setup for my blog
* I’d really like to find a way to get iCloud to let me create a permanent url, I’m an apple guy and this would be a super convenient way for me to post photos/videos/documents to my tiddlywiki’s
* I’m also not very tech savvy so it’d be nice to work with others to make some of this more user-friendly.
