== me and the web ==

* [https://hoschi-it.de hoschi-it.de] is my domain.
* That's kind of a playground still. Little content, code changes often.
* built with [[jekyll]]
* code and content hosted on [[gitlab]]
* served through [https://vercel.com vercel]
* webmention serving is done by [[webmention.io]]

== Itches ==
* Make every [[post]] a proper card with icons indicating syndication and responses
* Mark post types with corresponding icons
* Make post that I reply not show up as a nested blockquote anymore
* Move impressum to the footer
* Implement usage of [[micropub]]
