==Thoughts about the Wiki==

* [[Get Started]] should answer how to be "on the indieweb". It should answer questions such as:
** '''What is the indieweb?''' The indieweb is websites owned by people, not corporations. It's about having a permanent online home that ''you'' control.
** '''How do I get "on the indieweb?"''' When you have your own website at your own [[personal-domain | domain]] or [[subdomain]], you're on the indieweb. You can do more things like [[:Category:syndication | syndicate your posts]] to and from your social media accounts and [[Webmention | respond]] to other people's posts from your own site.
** '''How will my friends see my posts? How will I see others' posts?''' A [[feed reader]] or an email [[newsletter]] can help you and your friends keep up with each others posts without having to visit each other's websites regularly.
** It can mention [[IndieWebCamps | IWC]], [[Homebrew_Website_Club | HWC]], and [[discuss | the chat]], but those should not be the first things on the page.
* [[Quick_Start]] is what most people want and should be prominently highlighted on [[Get Started]]. I feel like I've run across duplicate content on pages like [[IndieWeb_as_a_Service | Indieweb as a Service]], though that also addresses more developer-oriented tools like Brid.gy and Webmention.io.
* Holy smokes the [[web_hosting | hosting]] page is overwhelming. A table might help for better readability and comparison.
* [[IndieMark]], which we say is the evaluation method for 'how indieweb am I', is mostly 'TBD' according to the wiki. Not a particularly helpful instrument as published.
