<span class="p-summary"> Kaja is a bot run by {{sknebel}}.</span>

== features ==
*announces in [[discuss|chat]] when the IndieWebCamp Youtube channel goes [[live]] during an event, and embeds it on the [[live]] page
* <code>!pin13</code>, <code>!mf2</code>, <code>!mf</code>, <code>!mf2-python</code>, <code>!mf2-go</code>, <code>!mf2-ruby</code>, <code>!mf2-php</code> followed by a URL return a URL to to the matching MF2 parser result. (some more variations exist as well). This also works when talking to Kaja directly, outside a channel
* wiki entries created via [[Loqi]] that have the form "Something is <url>, â€¦" get linkified: the url is added as a hyperlink to the defined term and removed from the sentence. Same happens if the URL is at the end of the definition.
* same for definitions that have a URL after the definition sentence (so saying "Kaja is a helpful bot. http://example.com" is linkified, "Kaja is a bot that edits http://indieweb.org" is not)

== in progress ==
*create HWC-page entries for HWC Berlin and potentially others
**currently working on parsing mf2 from an event posted on a personal homepage
**probably using two new mf2-attributes: <code>p-transportation</code> and <code>u-map</code> to match things currently added to events
**challenge: how to co-exist with user-edits and find correct location to put stuff (ordered by timezone is difficult if timezones aren't marked up!)

== ideas ==
* update /next-HWC and next-HWC box on front page
* add !stream command to give last seen URL
* update /topic in irc with stream link?
* mf2-parser commands without URL could work for last URL posted in channel
* etherpad import (compare https://github.com/kmaglione/wikimtgs and https://github.com/christi3k/ImportFromEtherpad)
* some kind of !tell notifier for users that are seldom in IRC (or something that tells the !tell-er to please use a different channel)
* are there other commonly needed tools that could use shortcuts?
* private "specific user is online" alerts?
* add Kaja to Slack as well, so Slack users can use direct commands

== feature requests ==
Think something would be neat?
* sknebel, another feature request, for Kaja now! Be able to append to a Inbox section on a user page.

== See Also ==

* "this probably is not Kaja, but a general tool, but can we do anything to easily align videos with chat for creation of demo pages"
* use selfauth instead of custom, DB-based auth endpoint? (with shared secret it'd be easy to generate the correct signed token)
* PM-alerts if specific user becomes available
* PM-countdowns for sknebel :P
* fix username changes on reconnect
* stop this from happening https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?diff=40604&oldid=40603&rcid=40514
