<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Kaja</dfn>''' is a bot run by {{sknebel}}.</span>

== features ==
*announces in [[discuss|chat]] when the IndieWebCamp Youtube channel goes [[live]] during an event, and embeds it on the [[live]] page
* <code>!pin13</code>, <code>!mf2</code>, <code>!mf</code>, <code>!mf2-python</code>, <code>!mf2-go</code>, <code>!mf2-ruby</code>, <code>!mf2-php</code> followed by a URL return a URL to to the matching MF2 parser result. (some more variations exist as well). This also works when talking to Kaja directly, outside a channel
* wiki entries created via [[Loqi]] that have the form "Something is <url>, …" get linkified: the url is added as a hyperlink to the defined term and removed from the sentence. Same happens if the URL is at the end of the definition.
* same for definitions that have a URL after the definition sentence (so saying "Kaja is a helpful bot. http://example.com" is linkified, "Kaja is a bot that edits http://indieweb.org" is not)

== on hold ==
*create HWC-page entries for HWC Berlin and potentially others
**currently working on parsing mf2 from an event posted on a personal homepage
**probably using two new mf2-attributes: <code>p-transportation</code> and <code>u-map</code> to match things currently added to events
**challenge: how to co-exist with user-edits and find correct location to put stuff (ordered by timezone is difficult if timezones aren't marked up!)

== ideas ==
* update /next-HWC and next-HWC box on front page
* add !stream command to give last seen URL
* update /topic in irc with stream link?
* mf2-parser commands without URL could work for last URL posted in channel
* etherpad import (compare https://github.com/kmaglione/wikimtgs and https://github.com/christi3k/ImportFromEtherpad)
* some kind of !tell notifier for users that are seldom in IRC (or something that tells the !tell-er to please use a different channel)
* are there other commonly needed tools that could use shortcuts?
* private "specific user is online" alerts?
* add Kaja to Slack as well, so Slack users can use direct commands

== feature requests ==
Think something would be neat?
* sknebel, another feature request, for Kaja now! Be able to append to a Inbox section on a user page.
* Update [[Events]] whenever any wiki page that starts with "/event/" in the URL is updated. -{{t}}
** parse that changed wiki page for an h-event
** if that event is already on /Events (there is an h-event there with URL of that wiki page)
** then update any details that (may) have changed (start, end, location locality, name), ok to limit to events using the event template
** else add an h-event using the event template to the right spot in [[Events#Upcoming]] (inside the right month subheading, between the soonest event before/after in that month if any)
** // this would make it easier to "just" update an individual [[HWC]] event page, and have the Events page auto-updated accordingly. So a host in a city only has to edit the specific [[HWC]] event page to add their location, and [[Events]] and the home page are updated automatically!

* "this probably is not Kaja, but a general tool, but can we do anything to easily align videos with chat for creation of demo pages"
* use selfauth instead of custom, DB-based auth endpoint? (with shared secret it'd be easy to generate the correct signed token)
* PM-alerts if specific user becomes available
* PM-countdowns for sknebel :P
* fix username changes on reconnect
* stop this from happening https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?diff=40604&oldid=40603&rcid=40514
* [[IRC#Bots_on_IRC|Bots on IRC]]
* BUG: didn't remove 2017-austin-demos stream after it ended
* potentially linkify format like https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?oldid=46130&rcid=46022 . also, start to collect false-positives for linkify
* mf2 commands should understand gists
* "do timezone conversions with city names"
* you need an avatar
* todo: limit HWCs on front page to some X weeks out
* do Who is via PM
