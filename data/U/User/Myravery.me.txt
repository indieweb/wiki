I'm a facilitator, anthropologist, and foresight practitioner. I currently lead strategic foresight activities at Mozilla.

==Itches==
* Integrating my digital identity after a decade of dissection into silos
* Overhauling my personal website to accommodate my whole self and professional goals
* Maintain meaningful connections with my friends and family who heavily use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc while minimizing my time spent on those platforms
