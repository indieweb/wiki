= hi. i'm ruby. =

I could put some info about me here, but I have [https://srxl.me/about-me a website for that.]

Wanna see the source code for my website? [https://git.isincredibly.gay/srxl/srxl.me Here ya go!]

* Webmentions
** Sending them
*** The site is kinda SSG, kinda not? It's an [https://astro.build/ Astro] side running in server mode.
*** Because publishing a new blog amounts to "commit a new file to Git and deploy", there's not really a good point to scan a new post for links to send Webmentions to.
*** I've seen people run cronjob-style thingies to periodically scan RSS feeds for new posts? That might work.
** Receiving them
*** This shouldn't be too hard, since I can just create [https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/ endpoints] in Astro to handle receiving Webmentions.
*** I kinda wanna take a jab at implementing the protocol myself, instead of grabbing a library. That sounds fun.
