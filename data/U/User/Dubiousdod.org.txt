I usually try to be [https://hidden-id.github.io secretive], but lets party :)

== Online ownership ==
* Owned many sites under various names since 1997 [citation needed? get a warrant] trying to keep the metadata cloud around him as vague as possible, but can be a good sport too, so... 
* Owns his '''[[Redwind]]''' ([https://dubiousdod.org/indie here]) since November 2014 (it's on /indie/ and not on / for boring tehcnical reasons, but I own that domain and nobody else does [I hope ;)]).
* Uses a weird [https://dubiousdod.org/indie/2014/11/here-http-codepen-io-anon-pen-ggjvbz-left-is-a-better bookmarklet] to reply/reshare/fav stuff (including tweets).
* POSSE to twitter (comes with Redwind).
* Twitter interactions are relayed as [[Webmention|webmentions]] via [[Bridgy]].
* Some of the items (articles, photos, bookmarks) get posted to [[Twister]] via a [https://github.com/thedod/feed2twister feed2twister] cron job.
* Also has a [[Diaspora]] account, but so far, integration with it sucks both ways :(
* Probably keeps posting on many other sites as well [citation needed? :p]
