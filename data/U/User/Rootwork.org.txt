=== Coding is just a small part of who I am ===

Technology is a means to an end, and shiny tech is not always the best means.

I‚Äôve worked as a [https://web.archive.org/web/20080131080116/http://www.genocideintervention.net/ human rights advocate], a [https://web.archive.org/web/20111226083543/http://www.casinofreephilly.org:80/ community organizer], and a [https://forusa.org/ nonprofit communications manager]. I‚Äôve been on the board of a [https://www.peacejusticestudies.org/ justice studies association], helped [https://www.afsc.org/content/afsc-and-nobel-peace-prize nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize], wrote about [https://works.swarthmore.edu/fac-soc-anth/29/ third-party nonviolent intervention] and used [https://web.archive.org/web/20050204141450/https://www.why-war.com/features/2003/11/diebold_analyzed.html electronic civil disobedience to fight insecure voting systems].

Really all my technological expertise and interest stems from those larger objectives for social change.

I‚Äôm also active in üö≤ [https://www.streetsblog.org/ re-thinking urban spaces], ü•ï [https://www.peoples.coop/ local food cooperatives], and üîî [https://www.bellsofthecascades.org/about semi-professional handbell performance].
