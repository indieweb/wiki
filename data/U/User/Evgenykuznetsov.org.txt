My name is Evgeny Kuznetsov and I have been running a personal blog jumping from one siloed blog platform to another since about 2003. My day job is in no way connected to software development, I am teaching at a medical university.

I first heard of the IndieWeb in late 2014 or early 2015 when [[User:Benwerd.com|Ben Werdmuller]] presented [[Known]] on one of the TWiT.tv podcasts. Consequently, I've been running my personal blog on https://evgenykuznetsov.org ever since, first as a hosted Known site, then briefly as a self-hosted Known instance; in 2020 I moved it to [[Hugo]].

I do some programming in my spare time as a hobby, but I'm far from qualified to do any serious website development. My contributions are mostly limited to occasional bugreports, translation and spreading the word. However, as I moved to Hugo, I wrote myself a little [https://github.com/nekr0z/static-webmentions tool] to facilitate sending webmentions and WebSub pushes.

== My site ==
Being a muggle in regard to web programming, I've been attracted to [[Known]]'s IndieWed-out-of-the-box concept from the beginning. Unfortunately, Known Pro has been dead in the water for a long time, and the hosted version hasn't seen updates for even longer, so in 2019 I have finally migrated to a self-hosted instance. It didn't help too much, and I found not being able to fix little glitches on my own (due to my PHP illiteracy) even more annoying now that I supposedly had things in my own hands.

Eventually, in 2020 I [https://evgenykuznetsov.org/posts/2020/un-known/ moved] on to [[Hugo]], and am happily continuing to live the IndieWeb life.

== Itches and Goals ==
Having very little technical expertise myself, I sympathize for people who have none. Hosting my own instance of Known was made possible by the fact I've been a desktop Linux user for a long time and know my way around the system a little; for a lot of people around me this barrier would be almost impassable. To become a participant in IndieWeb is (at the time of writing this) orders of magnitude harder than to put up a Facebook profile. This is exactly what Known originally intended to fix, and what my contributions, humble as they are, are ultimately targeted at.
