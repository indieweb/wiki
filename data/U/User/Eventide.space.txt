== Introduction ==

I'm Rei and I'm a big nerd. I do webdev professionally where i use Python and TypeScript and work with Kubernetes.

In my free time I mainly play games and watch videos. I program some stuff too with languages like Nim, Go and C.
I invested some time in curating my web experience by for example just using an RSS reader for all my social feeds instead.

I'm mainly active in the [[Yesterweb]] community and have my own website https://eventide.space

My site is based on a self-written static page generator that converts markdown files with metadata into the pages and adds them to an RSS feed.
