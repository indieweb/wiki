== Welcome ==
By using [[WordPress]] on your own domain, you are already a part of the IndieWeb. Below are some suggestions to help you '''<dfn>get started with upgrading your WordPress site to support additional IndieWeb philosophies and functionality</dfn>'''.

This page is a tutorial about helping people to quickly get set up using WordPress as the heart of their online experience.

The IndieWeb is about helping you to control your own online [[identity]] by writing and creating on a [[domain]] that you own where your content is truly yours. 

__TOC__

Part of the IndieWeb is also about connecting with people who have a set of shared values. Some of this community has built, shared, and refines a suite of simple plugins and tools, which are available for people who have a Wordpress.org-based website. You can use these to add a lot of social media-like functionality to your personal website to better interact with your family and friends online.

This basic tutorial will walk you through setting up IndieWeb specific functionality on your [[WordPress]] site. It assumes you have a [[personal domain]] of your own with a version of WordPress.org running. While there are many ways to get things up and running, this tutorial will try to take the simplest and most direct approach. 

These steps are by no means the only ways to do these things, but below are the most general and relatively standardized recommendations. Additional documentation can be found within the other WordPress related pages as well as within IndieWeb examples throughout the wiki for those who would like to extend, improve, or further automate the functionalities described below. 

These recommendations also can't possibly cover everyone's needs or desires. Feel free to browse the wiki, participate in chat, and come up with new and exciting pieces of functionality that others are sure to want on their sites too.

=== Overview ===
These relatively short instructions are meant to be simple to follow and require as little technical knowledge as possible. While some new terminology will be used, we'll try to define it as it occurs and give links to additional resources. 

If you've got a self-hosted WordPress site already up and running, installing and configuring some additional recommended plugins will be even easier.

In addition to the specifics below there are some additional video/pencast resources that are particular to WordPress and IndieWeb which are geared toward beginners which may be helpful when initially setting up one's site:
* 2018-05-01 {{chrisaldrich}} [http://boffosocko.com/2018/05/01/a-pencast-overview-with-audio-and-recorded-visual-diagrams-of-indieweb-technologies/ A pencast overview (with audio and recorded visual diagrams) of IndieWeb technologies]
* 2018-04-27 {{chrisaldrich}} [http://boffosocko.com/2018/04/27/setting-up-wordpress-for-indieweb-use/ Setting up WordPress for IndieWeb Use]
** Includes a walkthrough of installing some of the basic plugins


=== WordPress out of the Box ===
Because WordPress is such a robust and developed [[content management system]], it provides a lot of solid functionality for a personal website out of the box. We'll briefly note that it began in May 2003, has a large community of active developers and users, and powers 30+% of the web. Some of its features include:

* Simply installing WordPress on your own domain means you own your own personal domain and have a presence on the web
* You have the ability to easily and immediately begin publishing your own posts
* Permalinks are built into the system
* As long as you checked the box during set up, search engine and other robots (like Google, Bing, etc.) are able to index your site
* Content can be posted in [[HTML]], the common language of the web
* There is pre-existing user interface and functionality for searching your posts 
* Multiple [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post types]] including: [[articles]], [[notes]], [[bookmarks]], [[photos]], [[videos]], and [[audio]]
* Simple linear previous/next navigation between posts (possibly theme dependent)
* Simple search functionality: show search results on your own site

In the instructions below, we'll discuss adding some additional commonly useful functionality which isn't included in the core WordPress experience, but which will give you increased communication flexibility. Some of this functionality is similar to that of some social media websites, but smartly doesn't confine you to working within the walls of these [[silos]].

As you complete steps, try plugging your site into [http://indiewebify.me/ indiewebify.me]. It will give you instant feedback, confirming what is working properly or helping you fix it if not.


=== Prerequisites ===
For the sake of this document, we'll presume you've got a few prerequisites covered: 

==== Domain ====
This tutorial will presume you've already got a [[personal domain]] name set up with [[hosting]]. For help with obtaining a domain and web hosting service, see:
* [[Getting Started]]

==== A Basic WordPress Installation ====
We'll also presume you've got a basic installation of [[WordPress]] on your domain/host. There are a huge number of sites which can help with these portions if you need them. A good place to start if you do need help is [https://wordpress.org/download/ Download WordPress] from WordPress.org. 

Most hosting companies provide detailed installation instructions for installing WordPress. Many companies will also provide simple one button installations of WordPress as well.

The wiki also has an available [[Tutorial: Set up an IndieWebSite using WordPress on the Amazon cloud]] for those who would like to try that method.

Some of IndieWeb philosophy is about [[itches|building/adding what is useful to you]], so if you don't need or want pieces of functionality, please feel free to skip sections as necessary, though be aware some portions may be prerequisites for others. Users are also welcome to try other methods of attack, some of which are enumerated at [[Advanced WordPress Set Up]], in other [[WordPress]] related pages, or spread throughout the wiki on individual topic pages. Naturally, everyone is welcome to try their hand at writing their own code and [[self-dogfooding]] their work. Most, if not all of the plugins mentioned, are open sourced and can be found on [[Github]] if one wants to contribute code or documentation, report bugs, or suggestions.

=== Getting Help ===
'''You're not in this alone.''' There is almost always someone in either the IndieWeb main [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ chat] or in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/wordpress/ WordPress specific chat room]. Feel free to drop by there for help. 

There are also a variety of [[IndieWebCamps]] throughout the year as well as regular [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetings (both local and virtual) where you can find a variety of help as well.


=== Installing Themes and Plugins ===
For those who haven't done it before, below are some simple directions for how to install new Themes and Plugins into WordPress. Again, these aren't necessarily the only (or quickest) ways to do these things, but are likely the easiest without needing to learn special methods.

==== Installing a Theme ====
TK

==== Installing a Plugin ====
TK



== Themes and Microformats ==
For simplicity, we highly recommend installing the [[SemPress]] theme on your website. If you really want a different theme, then browse through the section below as well as other portions of the wiki, otherwise, you can skip to the next section.

[[WordPress Themes]] are meant to abstract away the look and feel of a website from the text, photos, and other content that they present. This will allow your website to change themes the way a person might change their clothes&mdash;the person (or website) stays fundamentally the same, but their appearance to the outside world changes.

Some of the most basic inter-website functionalities within the IndieWeb are enabled by simple web standards. These standards make it easier for individual sites to communicate with each other. Among these fundamental standards is the use of [[microformats]] which are semantic classes added to [[HTML]] tags. Some examples of microformats include <code>h-card</code>, <code>p-street-address</code>, or <code>u-photo</code>. Many of these microformats are relatively straightforward and indicate exactly what they mean, so <code>p-street-address</code> on a bit of HTML naturally indicates that the item it's wrapped around is a street address. 

Microformats are embedded in web pages and aren't necessarily seen by people, but instead are used by other computers, servers, and programs to help them understand the content on the page and how it is structured. In our example above, <code>h-card</code>, is tells other computers that the content that will be found inside it is the online equivalent of a business card which generally includes other microformats like <code>u-photo</code> which specifies a photo of the person about whom the business card is for along with their name (<code>p-name</code>), address, and country (<code>p-country-name</code>). 

Here's a relatively simple example of an h-card in which all the classes are microformats:
 
<pre>
<p class="h-card">
  <img class="u-photo" src="http://example.org/photo.png" alt="" />
  <a class="p-name u-url" href="http://example.org">Joe Bloggs</a>
  <a class="u-email" href="mailto:joebloggs@example.com">joebloggs@example.com</a>, 
  <span class="p-street-address">41 Automattic Lane</span>
  <span class="p-locality">Reykjav√≠k</span>
  <span class="p-country-name">Iceland</span>
</p>
</pre>

These microformats become more important when you are writing a reply on your own website to a post on another site. To show your reply, the receiving website has a [[parser]] that will look at your web page with the reply and be able to quickly and easily identify things like which part of your page contains your name, your photo, and the ''exact'' portion of your webpage that is the actual reply (as opposed to the header, footer, or sidebar content that perhaps isn't as directly relevant). 

While one doesn't need to know much, if anything, about microformats, suffice it to say that they're relatively important for site-to-site intercommunication. Fortunately for the average user, one's [[WordPress theme]] is responsible for handling and placing the microformats in the proper locations on your behalf&mdash;this is why you can promptly forget about them.  Because there are currently not many WordPress themes which properly implement the widest variety of microformats, we '''highly recommend''' starting out using the themes [[SemPress]], one of its [[SemPress#Child_Themes|many child themes]], or [[Independent Publisher]] which do an excellent job of integrating the most modern implementation of microformats version 2.

People often choose WordPress because of its power and flexibility. As part of this flexibility, there are thousands of available themes (and plugins) to choose from. Each theme may behave slightly differently within an IndieWeb context based on how compliant it is with modern web standards. Often you can choose almost any theme from the [https://wordpress.org/themes/ WordPress repository] or other reliable sources and they will work reasonably well because WordPress has portions of the older microformats version 1 built into it. However, because of how some themes implement their microformats (some themes do a poor job), your results may not be quite what you expect (or want). Often these small cosmetic issues will be seen when interacting with other websites and how they will automatically display your responses or replies.

Using the theme of your choice may work, but it may require additional testing, plugins, or custom code to display exactly what you want to inter-operate properly with other websites using these standards. We expect that over time and with growth, more and more themes will better support these simple standards.


== IndieWeb Plugin ==

The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ Indieweb Plugin] is a plugin with an installer interface that includes a bundle of several useful related standalone plugins that can help you quickly get set up to be a more active member of the Indieweb. Many of these plugins will be described below. Others may be described at [[WordPress/Plugins]] or on their own pages.

=== Rel-me ===
{{main|rel-me}}

One of the first things you will want to set up are [[rel-me]] links to your other profiles on the web. This will enable [[web-sign-in]] and [[IndieAuth]] using your domain as your identity. You can then sign into this wiki and begin [[wikifying]].

The easiest way to add rel="me" support to your site is to install the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/installation/ Indieweb Plugin]. This will add several common social media site fields to your "Edit User" page in the admin panel at <nowiki>yoursite.example.com/wp-admin/profile.php</nowiki>. (Be sure to change this URL to include your particular domain.) Fill these in with the usernames for your identities on the various services you use (Telephone, Github username, Google+ userID (not username), Twitter username (without @), Facebook ID, Last.fm username, Instagram username, Flickr username) and the plugin will create the proper (invisible) rel-me links in the head of your site. There is a field at the bottom of the "Edit User" page that one can list additional URLs for adding rel-me to as well. The [[rel-me]] and [[WordPress with Bridgy#Rel-me links]] pages can provide additional information if necessary.

If you view the source for your website afterwards, you'll see a number of links like <code><link rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/username" /></code> in the <code><head></code>. If you want the links to be visible on your site, you can use the rel-me widget, which will replace the hidden links with icons.

Now that your site has rel-me links pointing to your presences on several services, log into those services and include the URL of your site in the appropriate website fields of your profile so that they point back to your website in return. Having the ability to add rel-me links in your sites helps to indicate your ownership of them. 

Some services like Twitter and Instagram, which only allow one URL in your profile, support putting a second URL into your bio field if you have second personal site. Examples: {{kevinmarks}} and  {{chrisaldrich}} have [https://indieweb.org/multi-site_indieweb indiewebified  primary and secondary sites].

If your site has multiple Wordpress users, and you want to use it as an Indieweb site for one of the users, change the Indieweb identity settings in its "Options" pane:
* click IndieWeb in the admin sidebar
* click Options under the IndieWeb item in the admin sidebar
* In the main window:
** Check: '''Single Author Site [x]'''
** Pick yourself in '''Default Author _____v''' drop down menu.
** Save Changes

You can now '''test''' your rel-me setup with: [http://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ IndieWebify.Me Web Sign In validator]

'''Nota bene''': In late July 2016, [http://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ IndieWebify.Me] was [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/47 having problems] which may cause it to return incorrect results. If you think this may be the case, you can do an additional test described in "Authentication" below.


==== Authentication ====

As an additional test you should now be able to use your domain name to [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin log into this wiki] using your domain name. You'll be redirected to an [[IndieAuth]] page which will present you with a list of supported providers for login.

You can then begin [[wikify]]ing yourself and the rest of the site here.



=== h-card and Identity ===

Next you'll want to add an [[h-card]] to your homepage. An h-card can be thought of as the internet version of a business card or name card. Typically it will have your name, a photo, and some contact information. Like a business card, you can pick and choose what details to put on it. 

The quickest way to create one is to fill in all of the public facing personal details you'd like to present in your h-card at http://YOURSITE.COM/wp-admin/profile.php. Next, on your widgets configuration page (http://example.com/wp-admin/widgets.php), place the "H-Card Widget" in an agreeable sidebar, footer, other available location for your theme. Configure the few options for the widget if necessary.

Alternately, you might use the [http://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator h-card creator] to create the mark up for your card and place it in a widget or on a particular page.




== Post Kinds Plugin ==
To quickly and easily support a broad array of [[post]] types (with the correct [[microformats]]) install the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds plugin] (also bundled in the Indieweb plugin). The following post types are supported natively: [[article]], [[reply]], [[repost]], [[like]], [[favorite]], [[bookmark]], [[photo]], [[listen]], [[watch]], [[wish]], [[play]], [[jam]], [[read]], and [[mood]] with others forthcoming in future development work. The plugin's admin interface is simple and intuitive and auto-scrapes data from sites for post types that use an input URL. It also employs oEmbed well in the post too.





== Webmentions ==
and semantic linkbacks
* set up
* configuration
* home page webmentions

@Mentions, the ability for one webpage or post to let another know the first has linked to the second, were popularized by Twitter, but are also built into services like Facebook and Medium. Unfortunately these mentions only work ''within'' the specific site and do not inter-operate from site to site.

In IndieWeb, we use an open protocol called [[webmention]], which is a W3C recommendation, to allow independently operated sites to interact with each other just the way @mentions do on Twitter and other services. For those familiar with pingbacks or trackbacks in WordPress, webmentions are very similar, but are more secure, robust, and, importantly, display much better.

To enable this functionality the [[Webmention Plugin]] allows you to both send and receive [[webmention]]s by adding support to WordPress. Mentions sent to your site will show up as comments to posts or pages on your site. To use it you will want to install and active both the [[Webmention Plugin]] (for basic webmention functionality) and the [[Semantic_Linkbacks|Semantic Linkbacks plugin]](which will handle making the webmentions format properly within your comments section). 


=== Configuration ===
 
Neither of the two plugins requires any real configuration as the defaults are generally used by most. 

The Webmention plugin respects the Discussion settings about Notifying other blogs when they are mentioned, but also has its own settings page which can be configured. These are generally self-explanatory and are as follows:

* Disable self-pings on the same URL (for example "http://example.com/?p=123")
* Disable self-pings on the same Domain (for example "example.com")  
* Enable Webmention Support for Pages  (otherwise Webmention is only set up for posts)
* Automatically approve Webmention from these domains (to auto approve by incoming domain)
* Show a Webmention form at the comment section, to enable manual pings.  (This shows a small UI box at the bottom of your posts/pages to let people who don't have webmention enabled to manually send you webmentions.)
* Customize the explanatory text for the form
* Set a page for mentions of the homepage to be sent to
* Show avatars on webmentions when possible

For [[homepage webmentions]], some people prefer not to show them as comments there, but on a separate [[mentions|mentions page]]. If this is the case, one should create a new page with an appropriate name (many use "Mentions"), designate it as public or private depending on your preference, and save it. Then revisit the settings page above and select that page name from the dropdown menu. Now when people send webmentions to your home page, they will be collected at the designated page.

Semantic Linkbacks has settings to display mentions as Facepiles.




== IndieAuth ==
=== IndieAuth Plugin ===
Via the Indieweb Plugin or from the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ WordPress repository], you can install and activate the IndieAuth Plugin. 

It offers two different functions. It can act as an IndieAuth endpoint to third-party sites, alowing you to use your WordPress credentials to authenticate to other sites, or authorize them to log in on your behalf(such as posting clients). Or it supports web sign-in(using your domain) into your site using a third-party site.





== Micropub ==
{{main|Micropub}}






== WebSub ==
{{main|WebSub}}
Naturally one wants a better way to tell the world when one updates one's site with a new post. This is best done with [[WebSub]] (fka [[PubSubHubbub]]) (PuSH) support for posts and it can be handled by installing and activating the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/ PubSubHubbub plugin]. No configuration is really necessary as it comes preconfigured with custom hubs [[Superfeedr]] at http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com and http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com. Others could be added if desired. 




== Syndication ==
=== POSSE ===
{{main|PESOS}}

"Post on your own site, syndicate elsewhere" is a cornerstone of the IndieWeb community. There are literally dozens of ways to implement it. The quickest and easiest of them is to enable WordPress's [https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/ JetPack plugin] and configure the Publicize module within it to syndicate your content quickly to the common silos like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, and LinkedIn. There's even a simple checkbox interface in the admin UI for choosing which [[silos]] you'd like to syndicate to. (Alternate POSSE plugins and methods can be found at [[WordPress/Plugins#POSSE Plugins]].)

=== PESOS ===
{{main|PESOS}}

Definition and description TK


=== Syndication Links ===
A POSSE workflow is always nicer when one can provide links on one's site to the syndicated copies. The quickest way to do this is to install and activate [https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/ Syndication Links] which is also included in the IndieWeb plugin.  This plugin provides a text box in the admin UI for posts which one can include the permalinks of the POSSE copies of one's original content. These permalinks are automatically properly wrapped in the appropriate microformats for other services to do [[original-post-discovery]]. Options in the plugin allow one to choose between text and either a color or black/white icon set for display. The plugin also has code for automatically importing/storing these permalinks based on other POSSE plugins including support for [[SNAP]] as well as Tumblr CrossPoster, WordPress CrossPoster, Diaposter (for Diaspora), Medium, and Mastadon AutoPoster. Integrations may be possible with other POSSE plugins on request. Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to the JetPack suggestion above due inability to retrieve the URL, so one will need to copy and paste the POSSE urls into Syndication Links manually. But then again, [[manual until it hurts]] is often worthwhile.

 


== Backfeed with Brid.gy ==
=== Handling Responses ===
One would generally like to have one's site be able to handle responses from other sites. Toward this end, one wants to be able to receive [[webmentions]] and display [[comments]] on every post type you publish. The webmention plugin discussed above handles both the sending and receiving of webmentions, so that is already covered. To better display these received webmentions one wants to install and activate the following plugin:
* '''[[Semantic Linkbacks]]''' - makes indieweb comments look better on your site, recognizing them as being likes, replies, etc. and displaying appropriately. 


In addition to sending one's content to [[silos]], ideally one would also like to accept comments, replies, likes, and other replies to these copies back on one's own site. This is known in the IndieWeb community as [[backfeed]].

The easiest way to implement backfeed on WordPress is to support [[webmentions]] (enabled above) and have properly configured rel-me links (see above) and connecting one's site to [[Bridgy]]. Bridgy then handles crawling one's siloed copies, finding the original posts, and then sending webmentions so those posts to appear as comments. Detailed instructions for doing this are laid out separately at [[WordPress with Bridgy]].





== Next steps ==
These basic steps will take one's site a long way towards supporting some of the most common and powerful IndieWeb technologies that currently exist. 

Naturally, there are alternate ways of adding some of the functionalities described above using alternate methods or plugins. Some of these can be found on the [[Advanced_WordPress_Set_Up]] page, within [[WordPress/Plugins]], on other related WordPress pages, or within other parts of the wiki. Further, many pages in the wiki include examples of functionality, UI/UX, and even brainstorming for ideas that continue to extend the value and power of the independent web. We invite you to explore and experiment to help create the internet you'd like to have for yourself.

== FAQ ==
; Why does the comment on my site not show the author's information?
; Why does the comment show a link to bridgy.appspot.com instead of the social network?
: Please ensure that you have both the Webmention plugin ''and'' the Semantic Linkbacks plugin installed.
; WordPress seems to be blocking Bridgy
: The WordPress service in [[Bridgy]] is only meant for people using WordPress.com who can't install the indieweb plugins from WordPress.org (or GitHub) themselves on their own server. If you're using WordPress.org self-hosted code, then you just need to connect Brid.gy to your social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
; Where can I find help or assistance with adding Indieweb technology to my WordPress installation?
: Try the [[WordPress_Outreach_Club]] or ask your question in the [[IRC]] channel. If you think you've found a bug, feel free to file an issue in the [[github]] repository for the particular plugin you're having problems with.

= From Greg's version =
'''Plugins'''

The WordPress community also connects with the larger IndieWeb using plugins, these are add-ons to WordPress that introduce new functionality. There are a number of IndieWeb plugins you will need to install. Sometimes these plugins can conflict with your current theme.

If this happens you are again left with the choice of editing your theme or choosing a new one.

'''Post Types'''

The IndieWeb also uses specific types of post, or post-types, that look follow semantic rules, which basically means how the microformats markup works. IndieWeb WordPress themes handle post types differently.

Each post types have specific rules a user should follow. For example notes should not get a tielte even though there will be a field in WordPress to add a note title.


While each plug-in is described in further detail below it is important to note you do not need to install all the plugins when using a 100% IndieWeb comptaible theme. Install the microformats plugin since the mark up is built in. You also do not need the post-kind plug in because that uses a a different method than SemPress to build the different IndieWeb post types.

To get started you should still install the IndieWeb plugin. This plugin ads functionality and different plugins. Once installed you will need to activate webmentions and semantic linkbacks.


''''' Setting up your h-card'''''
To setup your h-card in SemPress use the IndieWeb plugin, add to your WordPress profile, then add the h-card widget to your homepage. 
You can alos manually add an hcard to your header or footer.

In 2016-Indieweb the h-card is included in the IndieWeb plug-in. You install the plug-in and then edit your WordPress profile. Go to users>my profile> and then fill in links to your other websites.

Then you can add an h-card widget to you hompage header, footer, or sidebar.

====2016-IndieWeb====
2016 is one of the most popular out of the box WordPress theme. An #IndieWeb compatible version is available on GitHub. To install the theme you can  [https://github.com/dshanske/twentysixteen-indieweb/archive/master.zip download the theme.] This is a .zip file. You do no even need to open it.

Then in WordPress go to Appearance>Theme>New Theme>Upload Theme>and select your .zip file.

You will need to check GitHub for periodic theme updates. You can star or watch a GitHub repo to learn of updates.


The theme allows you to set up a static homepage. To do this you need to go to Customize>Homepage>Select static homepage. You may need to create a new page where all your posts will get published.


If you want to syndicate posts using an IndieWeb plugin you should activate Brid.gy. There are other syndication tools described below as well.

Finally if you want to publish to your WordPress site using a third party IndieWeb client, like an Android app or iOS app for example, you will need to activate the micropub plug-in.


== Testing Your Current Theme ==
If you love the way your theme looks and want to find out if you can use it to connect to the large IndieWeb community then follow the tutorial below.

Be forewarned many themes, especially ones with all of the bells and whistles, may not be compatible with IndieWeb plugins without theme editing that is beyond the skill level of even the most experienced WordPress users.

When you are done we will walk you through how to test the site or you can stop our chat at https://chat.indieweb.org and ask for help with testing, or at any time during your set up process

== Using a Non-Compliant Theme ==
You may find your theme or plugin set up is not compatible with IndieWeb pulgins. This will happen often. You are now faced with teh choice of changign your theme and design or giving up on the #IndieWeb.



== Brainstorming ==
* Where possible move some of the "theme cruft" to one of the pages to that specific theme.
** Perhaps include h-cards and how the are or aren't handled
* Try not to get too far into the weeds on theme issues


= Move somewhere else =
The following chunks should be moved to appropriate pages:

==== Hosted at WordPress.com ====
TK -- move this to a wordpress.com specific set up page

WordPress.com limits the plugins that you can use, so you'll need to use the WordPress menu and widget system.

* In the admin, go to Appearance > Menus
* Create a new menu
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me1.png]]
* Click ''Screen Options'' at the top and check the box to display ''Link Relationships (XFN)''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me2.png]]
* Click ''Custom Links'' and add the link to your profile, e.g <nowiki>https://twitter.com/username</nowiki>. Enter the link text and click ''Add to Menu''. Repeat for as many profile links as you want to add.
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me3.png]]
* Under ''Menu Structure'' click the arrow beside the newly-added link. In the ''Link Relationship (XFN)'' field enter <kbd>me</kbd> and click ''Save''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me4.png]]
* Go to Appearance > Widgets
* Drag a ''Custom Menu'' widget into the ''Sidebar''
* Click the arrow to expand the ''Custom Menu'', select the menu you created, then click ''Save''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me5.png]]
* Your profile links should now appear in your sidebar, or wherever your theme places the widget. 
** [[File:Wordpress-com-rel-me6.png]]
