== Welcome ==
By using [[WordPress]] on your own domain, you are ''already'' a part of the IndieWeb. Below are some suggestions to help you '''<dfn>get started with upgrading your WordPress site to support additional IndieWeb philosophies and functionality</dfn>'''.

This page is a tutorial about helping people to quickly get set up using WordPress as the heart of their online experience.

The IndieWeb is about helping you to control your own online [[identity]] by writing and creating on a [[domain]] that you own where your content is truly yours. 

__TOC__

Part of the IndieWeb is also about connecting with people who have a set of shared values. Some of this community has built, shared, and refines a suite of simple plugins and tools, which are available for people who have a Wordpress.org-based website. You can use these to add a lot of social media-like functionality to your personal website to better interact with your family and friends online.

This basic tutorial will walk you through setting up IndieWeb specific functionality on your [[WordPress]] site. It assumes you have a [[personal domain]] of your own with a version of WordPress.org running. While there are many ways to get things up and running, this tutorial will try to take the simplest and most direct approach. 

These steps are by no means the only ways to do these things, but below are the most general and relatively standardized recommendations. Additional documentation can be found within the other WordPress related pages as well as within IndieWeb examples throughout the wiki for those who would like to extend, improve, or further automate the functionalities described below. 

These recommendations also can't possibly cover everyone's needs or desires. Feel free to browse the wiki, participate in chat, and come up with new and exciting pieces of functionality that others are sure to want on their sites too.

=== Overview ===
These relatively short instructions are meant to be simple to follow and require as little technical knowledge as possible. While some new terminology will be used, we'll try to define it as it occurs and give links to additional resources. 

If you've got a self-hosted WordPress site already up and running, installing and configuring some additional recommended plugins will be even easier.

In addition to the specifics below there are some additional video/pencast resources that are particular to WordPress and IndieWeb which are geared toward beginners which may be helpful when initially setting up one's site:
* 2018-05-01 {{chrisaldrich}} [http://boffosocko.com/2018/05/01/a-pencast-overview-with-audio-and-recorded-visual-diagrams-of-indieweb-technologies/ A pencast overview (with audio and recorded visual diagrams) of IndieWeb technologies]
* 2018-04-27 {{chrisaldrich}} [http://boffosocko.com/2018/04/27/setting-up-wordpress-for-indieweb-use/ Setting up WordPress for IndieWeb Use]
** Includes a walkthrough of installing some of the basic plugins

=== WordPress out of the Box ===
Because WordPress is such a robust and developed [[content management system]], it provides a lot of solid functionality for a personal website out of the box. We'll briefly note that it began in May 2003, has a large community of active developers and users, and powers 30+% of the web. Some of its features include:

* Simply installing WordPress on your own domain means you own your own personal domain and have a presence on the web
* You have the ability to easily and immediately begin publishing your own posts
* Permalinks are built into the system
* As long as you checked the box during set up, search engine and other robots (like Google, Bing, etc.) are able to index your site
* Content can be posted in [[HTML]], the common language of the web
* There is pre-existing user interface and functionality for searching your posts 
* Multiple [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post types]] possible including: [[articles]], [[notes]], [[bookmarks]], [[photos]], [[videos]], and [[audio]]
* Simple linear previous/next navigation between posts (possibly theme dependent)
* Simple search functionality: show search results on your own site

In the instructions below, we'll discuss adding some additional commonly useful functionality which isn't included in the core WordPress experience, but which will give you increased communication flexibility. Some of this functionality is similar to that of some social media websites, but smartly doesn't confine you to working within the walls of these [[silos]].

As you complete steps, try plugging your site into [http://indiewebify.me/ indiewebify.me]. It will give you instant feedback, confirming what is working properly or helping you fix it if not.

=== Prerequisites ===
For the sake of this document, we'll presume you've got a few prerequisites covered: 

==== Domain ====
This tutorial will presume you've already got a [[personal domain]] name set up with [[hosting]]. For help with obtaining a domain and web hosting service, see:
* [[Getting Started]]

==== A Basic WordPress Installation ====
We'll also presume you've got a basic installation of [[WordPress]] on your domain/host. There are a huge number of sites which can help with these portions if you need them. A good place to start if you do need help is [https://wordpress.org/download/ Download WordPress] from WordPress.org. 

* Most hosting companies provide detailed installation instructions for installing WordPress. 
* Many hosting companies will also provide simple one button installations of WordPress or other tools like C-Panel or Fantastico to make installing easy.
* At worst, you can usually follow the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress WordPress.org instructions for their five minute install] or find detailed tutorials or videos about what to do online.
* This wiki has an available [[Tutorial: Set up an IndieWebSite using WordPress on the Amazon cloud]] for those who would like to try that method.

Some of IndieWeb philosophy is about [[itches|building/adding what is useful to you]], so if you don't need or want pieces of functionality, please feel free to skip sections as necessary, though be aware some portions may be prerequisites for others. Users are also welcome to try other methods of attack, some of which are enumerated at [[Advanced WordPress Set Up]], in other [[WordPress]] related pages, or spread throughout the wiki on individual topic pages. Naturally, everyone is welcome to try their hand at writing their own code and [[self-dogfooding]] their work. Most, if not all of the plugins mentioned, are open sourced and can be found on [[Github]] if one wants to contribute code or documentation, report bugs, or suggestions.

=== Getting Help ===
'''You're not in this alone.''' There is almost always someone in either the IndieWeb main [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ chat] or in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/wordpress/ WordPress specific chat room]. Feel free to drop by there for help. 

There are also a variety of [[IndieWebCamps]] throughout the year as well as regular [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetings (both local and virtual) where you can find a variety of help as well.

=== Themes and Plugins ===
WordPress is a highly extensible platform that allows one to quickly change the look of a website by installing and activating new themes or to add additional modular functionality by downloading and activating plugins. To make your website more IndieWeb capable and [[friendly]], we'll be changing the theme and adding several plugins to change how your website works.

For those who haven't done it before, below are some simple directions for how to install new Themes and Plugins into WordPress. You'll need to be able to do both of these to IndieWebify your website. Again, these aren't necessarily the only (or quickest) ways to do these things, but are likely the easiest without needing to learn special methods.

==== Installing a Theme ====
* Login to your site
* From the administrative user interface go to the menu options Appearance >> Themes
* Click the "Add New" button at the top of the page
* In the search box, type the name of the theme you're looking for and hit the return or enter key. This will search the official WordPress repository for the theme you're looking for.
* From the results selections, click the "Install" button for the theme you desire.
* Finally, to make the theme active, click the "Activate" link on that theme.
* Your site should now have the new theme active and ready to go.


[[File:Installing_a_Theme.PNG|center|alt=Screencapture of the WP admin UI highlighting the Appearance>>Themes section and the "Add New" button on the Themes interface page]]

==== Installing a Plugin ====
* Login to your site;
* From the administrative user interface go to the menu options Plugins >> Add New;
* Use the search interface to search for the plugin you desire;
* On the card for the desired plugin, click the "Install Now" button;
* To activate the plugin to work on your site, click the "Activate" button;
* If necessary, visit the plugin's settings page(s) to make any configuration or options changes needed for your desired functionality
* Your site should now have the new plugin active and ready to go.


== Themes and Microformats ==
{{main|WordPress/Themes|WordPress Themes}}

[[WordPress Themes]] are meant to abstract away the look and feel of a website from the text, photos, and other content that they present. This will allow your website to change themes the way a person might change their clothes&mdash;the person (or website) stays fundamentally the same, but their appearance to the outside world changes.

For simplicity, we '''highly recommend''' new IndieWeb WordPress users start off by installing, activating, and using the [[SemPress]] theme on your website. We recommend this because SemPress has very solid [[microformats]] version 2 support which dramatically helps usability and user interface, particularly when interacting with other websites. More details on why microformats with respect to WordPress and additional themes can be found at [[WordPress Themes]].


== IndieWeb Plugin ==
{{main|WordPress_IndieWeb_Plugin}}
The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ Indieweb Plugin] will help you establish your IndieWeb identity by extending your online profile with [[rel-me]] and [[h-card]] fields, as well as helping you more quickly install additional IndieWeb plugins by way of an installer interface. Many of these recommended plugins will be described below. Others may be described at [[WordPress/Plugins]] or on their own individual pages here on the wiki.

=== Online Identity using h-card ===
To help project your identity on the internet, particularly in interacting with other websites, you may want to add an [[h-card]] to your homepage. An h-card can be thought of as the internet version of a business card or name card. Typically it will have your name, a photo, and some basic contact information. Like a business card, you can pick and choose what details to put on it.

The quickest way to create one is to install and activate the IndieWeb plugin, and then fill in all of the public facing personal details you would like to present in your h-card at <code>http://YOURSITE.COM/wp-admin/profile.php</code>. Next, on your widgets configuration page <code>http://example.com/wp-admin/widgets.php</code>, place the "H-Card Widget" in an appropriate sidebar, footer, other available location for your theme. Configure the few options for the widget if necessary.

Alternately, you might use the [http://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator h-card creator] to create the mark up for your card and place it in an HTML widget or on a particular page&mdash;some put one on their [[about]] page. This method does not require the IndieWeb plugin.

== IndieAuth Plugin ==
{{main|Wordpress_IndieAuth_Plugin|IndieAuth Plugin}}
See also: [[IndieAuth]]

Via the Indieweb Plugin interface, from the plugin search interface (see above), or from the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ WordPress repository], you can install and activate the IndieAuth Plugin. 

It offers two different functions:
* It can act as an IndieAuth endpoint to third-party sites, allowing you to use your WordPress credentials to authenticate to other sites, or authorize them to log in on your behalf (such as Micropub or other posting clients). 
* It supports web sign-in (using your domain name) into your site using a third-party site.

=== Wiki sign in ===
With the IndieAuth Plugin set up, you should now be able to use your domain name to [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin log into this wiki]. You'll be redirected to an [[IndieAuth]] page which will present you with a list of supported providers for login.

You can then begin [[wikify]]ing yourself and contribute to the wiki.



== Post Kinds Plugin ==
TK to fix

To quickly and easily support a broad array of [[post]] types (with the correct [[microformats]]) install the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds plugin] (also bundled in the Indieweb plugin). The following post types are supported natively: [[article]], [[reply]], [[repost]], [[like]], [[favorite]], [[bookmark]], [[photo]], [[listen]], [[watch]], [[wish]], [[play]], [[jam]], [[read]], and [[mood]] with others forthcoming in future development work. The plugin's admin interface is simple and intuitive and auto-scrapes data from sites for post types that use an input URL. It also employs oEmbed well in the post too.





== Webmentions ==
TK to fix
and semantic linkbacks
* set up
* configuration
* home page webmentions

@Mentions, the ability for one webpage or post to let another know the first has linked to the second, were popularized by Twitter, but are also built into services like Facebook and Medium. Unfortunately these mentions only work ''within'' the specific site and do not inter-operate from site to site.

In IndieWeb, we use an open protocol called [[webmention]], which is a W3C recommendation, to allow independently operated sites to interact with each other just the way @mentions do on Twitter and other services. For those familiar with pingbacks or trackbacks in WordPress, webmentions are very similar, but are more secure, robust, and, importantly, display much better.

To enable this functionality the [[Webmention Plugin]] allows you to both send and receive [[webmention]]s by adding support to WordPress. Mentions sent to your site will show up as comments to posts or pages on your site. To use it you will want to install and active both the [[Webmention Plugin]] (for basic webmention functionality) and the [[Semantic_Linkbacks|Semantic Linkbacks plugin]](which will handle making the webmentions format properly within your comments section). 


=== Configuration ===
 
Neither of the two plugins require any real configuration as the defaults generally satisfy most people. 

The Webmention plugin respects the Discussion settings about Notifying other blogs when they are mentioned, but also has its own settings page which can be configured. These are generally self-explanatory and are as follows:

* Disable self-pings on the same permalink or URL (for example "https://example.com/?p=123")
* Disable self-pings on the same domain (for example "example.com")  
* Enable Webmention support for pages  (otherwise Webmention is only set up for posts)
* Automatically approve Webmention from these domains (to auto approve by incoming domain)
* Show a Webmention form at the comment section, to enable manual pings.  (This shows a small UI box at the bottom of your posts/pages to let people who don't have webmention enabled to manually send you webmentions.)
* Customize the explanatory text for the form
* Set a page for mentions of the homepage to be sent to
* Show avatars on webmentions when possible

For [[homepage webmentions]], some people prefer not to show them as comments there, but on a separate [[mentions|mentions page]]. If this is the case, one should create a new page with an appropriate name (many use "Mentions"), designate it as public or private depending on your preference, and save it. Then revisit the settings page above and select that page name from the dropdown menu. Now when people send webmentions to your home page, they will be collected at the designated page.

Semantic Linkbacks has settings to display mentions as [[facepile|Facepiles]]. These settings can be found in the Webmention settings page if you have that plugin active, otherwise they will be in your Discussion settings.

== Micropub ==
{{main|Micropub}}

When you install the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub/ Micropub Plugin] on your WordPress.org site, it can act as a Micropub server that accepts requests from [[Micropub/Clients|Micropub Clients]] and convert them into posts. This allows you to make use of various client tools while browsing the internet, and syndicate back to your own site.

Because Micropub is a W3C Recommendation as an open API standard, it is possible to make use of applications that do various things or specific tailored actions, and still all feed back to your site. These applications can include apps on mobile devices, browser addons, and other websites completely.

== WebSub ==
{{main|WebSub}}

tk
Naturally one wants a better way to tell the world when one updates one's site with a new post. This is best done with [[WebSub]] (formerly known as PubSubHubbub) (PuSH) support for posts and it can be handled by installing and activating the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/ PubSubHubbub plugin]. No configuration is really necessary as it comes preconfigured with custom hubs [[Superfeedr]] at http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com and http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com. Others could be added if desired.

== Syndication ==
=== POSSE ===
{{main|POSSE}}

"Post on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere" is a cornerstone of the IndieWeb community. There are literally dozens of ways to implement "POSSE". The quickest and easiest way is to enable WordPress's [https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/ Jetpack plugin] and configure its Publicize module to syndicate your content quickly to the common silos like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and LinkedIn. There's even a simple checkbox interface in the admin UI for choosing which [[silos]] you'd like to syndicate to. (Alternate POSSE plugins and methods can be found at [[WordPress/Plugins#POSSE Plugins]].)

=== PESOS ===
{{main|PESOS}}

Definition and description TK


=== Syndication Links ===
A POSSE workflow is always nicer when one can provide links on one's site to the syndicated copies. The quickest way to do this is to install and activate [https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/ Syndication Links] which is also included in the IndieWeb plugin.  This plugin provides a text box in the admin UI for posts which one can include the permalinks of the POSSE copies of one's original content. These permalinks are automatically properly wrapped in the appropriate microformats for other services to do [[original-post-discovery]]. Options in the plugin allow one to choose between text and either a color or black/white icon set for display. The plugin also has code for automatically importing/storing these permalinks based on other POSSE plugins including support for [[SNAP]] as well as Tumblr CrossPoster, WordPress CrossPoster, Diaposter (for Diaspora), Medium, and Mastadon AutoPoster. Integrations may be possible with other POSSE plugins on request. Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to the JetPack suggestion above due inability to retrieve the URL, so one will need to copy and paste the POSSE urls into Syndication Links manually. But then again, [[manual until it hurts]] is often worthwhile.

 


== Backfeed with Brid.gy ==
=== Handling Responses ===
One would generally like to have one's site be able to handle responses from other sites. Toward this end, one wants to be able to receive [[webmentions]] and display [[comments]] on every post type you publish. The webmention plugin discussed above handles both the sending and receiving of webmentions, so that is already covered. To better display these received webmentions one wants to install and activate the following plugin:
* '''[[Semantic Linkbacks]]''' - makes indieweb comments look better on your site, recognizing them as being likes, replies, etc. and displaying appropriately. 

In addition to sending one's content to [[silos]], ideally one would also like to accept comments, replies, likes, and other replies to these copies back on one's own site. This is known in the IndieWeb community as [[backfeed]].

The easiest way to implement backfeed on WordPress is to support [[webmentions]] (enabled above) and have properly configured rel-me links (see above) and connecting one's site to [[Bridgy]]. Bridgy then handles crawling one's siloed copies, finding the original posts, and then sending webmentions so those posts to appear as comments. Detailed instructions for doing this are laid out separately at [[WordPress with Bridgy]].





== Microsub ==
{{main|Microsub}}

== Next steps ==
These basic steps will take one's site a long way towards supporting some of the most common and powerful IndieWeb technologies that currently exist. 

Naturally, there are alternate ways of adding some of the functionalities described above using alternate methods or plugins. Some of these can be found on the [[Advanced_WordPress_Set_Up]] page, within [[WordPress/Plugins]], on other related WordPress pages, or within other parts of the wiki. Further, many pages in the wiki include examples of functionality, UI/UX, and even brainstorming for ideas that continue to extend the value and power of the independent web. We invite you to explore and experiment to help create the internet you'd like to have for yourself.

* add other things


== FAQ ==
; Why does the comment on my site not show the author's information?
; Why does the comment show a link to bridgy.appspot.com instead of the social network?
: Please ensure that you have both the Webmention plugin ''and'' the Semantic Linkbacks plugin installed.
; WordPress seems to be blocking Bridgy
: The WordPress service in [[Bridgy]] is only meant for people using WordPress.com who can't install the indieweb plugins from WordPress.org (or GitHub) themselves on their own server. If you're using WordPress.org self-hosted code, then you just need to connect Brid.gy to your social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
; Where can I find help or assistance with adding Indieweb technology to my WordPress installation?
: Try the [[WordPress_Outreach_Club]] or ask your question in the [[IRC]] channel. If you think you've found a bug, feel free to file an issue in the [[github]] repository for the particular plugin you're having problems with.

= From Greg's version =
'''Plugins'''

The WordPress community also connects with the larger IndieWeb using plugins, these are add-ons to WordPress that introduce new functionality. There are a number of IndieWeb plugins you will need to install. Sometimes these plugins can conflict with your current theme.

If this happens you are again left with the choice of editing your theme or choosing a new one.

'''Post Types'''

The IndieWeb also uses specific types of post, or post-types, that look follow semantic rules, which basically means how the microformats markup works. IndieWeb WordPress themes handle post types differently.

Each post types have specific rules a user should follow. For example notes should not get a tielte even though there will be a field in WordPress to add a note title.


While each plug-in is described in further detail below it is important to note you do not need to install all the plugins when using a 100% IndieWeb comptaible theme. Install the microformats plugin since the mark up is built in. You also do not need the post-kind plug in because that uses a a different method than SemPress to build the different IndieWeb post types.

To get started you should still install the IndieWeb plugin. This plugin ads functionality and different plugins. Once installed you will need to activate webmentions and semantic linkbacks.


''''' Setting up your h-card'''''
To setup your h-card in SemPress use the IndieWeb plugin, add to your WordPress profile, then add the h-card widget to your homepage. 
You can alos manually add an hcard to your header or footer.

In 2016-Indieweb the h-card is included in the IndieWeb plug-in. You install the plug-in and then edit your WordPress profile. Go to users>my profile> and then fill in links to your other websites.

Then you can add an h-card widget to you hompage header, footer, or sidebar.

====2016-IndieWeb====
2016 is one of the most popular out of the box WordPress theme. An #IndieWeb compatible version is available on GitHub. To install the theme you can  [https://github.com/dshanske/twentysixteen-indieweb/archive/master.zip download the theme.] This is a .zip file. You do no even need to open it.

Then in WordPress go to Appearance>Theme>New Theme>Upload Theme>and select your .zip file.

You will need to check GitHub for periodic theme updates. You can star or watch a GitHub repo to learn of updates.


The theme allows you to set up a static homepage. To do this you need to go to Customize>Homepage>Select static homepage. You may need to create a new page where all your posts will get published.


If you want to syndicate posts using an IndieWeb plugin you should activate Brid.gy. There are other syndication tools described below as well.

Finally if you want to publish to your WordPress site using a third party IndieWeb client, like an Android app or iOS app for example, you will need to activate the micropub plug-in.


== Testing Your Current Theme ==
If you love the way your theme looks and want to find out if you can use it to connect to the large IndieWeb community then follow the tutorial below.

Be forewarned many themes, especially ones with all of the bells and whistles, may not be compatible with IndieWeb plugins without theme editing that is beyond the skill level of even the most experienced WordPress users.

When you are done we will walk you through how to test the site or you can stop our chat at https://chat.indieweb.org and ask for help with testing, or at any time during your set up process

== Using a Non-Compliant Theme ==
You may find your theme or plugin set up is not compatible with IndieWeb pulgins. This will happen often. You are now faced with teh choice of changign your theme and design or giving up on the #IndieWeb.



== Brainstorming ==
* Where possible move some of the "theme cruft" to one of the pages to that specific theme.
** Perhaps include h-cards and how the are or aren't handled
* Try not to get too far into the weeds on theme issues


= Move somewhere else =
The following chunks should be moved to appropriate pages:

== Hosted at WordPress.com ==
TK -- move this to a wordpress.com specific set up page

WordPress.com limits the plugins that you can use, so you'll need to use the WordPress menu and widget system.

* In the admin, go to Appearance > Menus
* Create a new menu
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me1.png]]
* Click ''Screen Options'' at the top and check the box to display ''Link Relationships (XFN)''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me2.png]]
* Click ''Custom Links'' and add the link to your profile, e.g <nowiki>https://twitter.com/username</nowiki>. Enter the link text and click ''Add to Menu''. Repeat for as many profile links as you want to add.
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me3.png]]
* Under ''Menu Structure'' click the arrow beside the newly-added link. In the ''Link Relationship (XFN)'' field enter <kbd>me</kbd> and click ''Save''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me4.png]]
* Go to Appearance > Widgets
* Drag a ''Custom Menu'' widget into the ''Sidebar''
* Click the arrow to expand the ''Custom Menu'', select the menu you created, then click ''Save''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me5.png]]
* Your profile links should now appear in your sidebar, or wherever your theme places the widget. 
** [[File:Wordpress-com-rel-me6.png]]


== Rel-me ==
{{main|rel-me}}

Removed this section in lieu of IndieAuth plugin which supercedes most of the functionality.

One of the first things you will want to set up are [[rel-me]] links to your other profiles on the web. This will enable [[web-sign-in]] and [[IndieAuth]] using your domain as your identity. You can then sign into this wiki and begin [[wikifying]].

The easiest way to add rel="me" support to your site is to install the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/installation/ Indieweb Plugin]. This will add several common social media site fields to your "Edit User" page in the admin panel at <nowiki>yoursite.example.com/wp-admin/profile.php</nowiki>. (Be sure to change this URL to include your particular domain.) Fill these in with the usernames for your identities on the various services you use (Telephone, Github username, Google+ userID (not username), Twitter username (without @), Facebook ID, Last.fm username, Instagram username, Flickr username) and the plugin will create the proper (invisible) rel-me links in the head of your site. There is a field at the bottom of the "Edit User" page that one can list additional URLs for adding rel-me to as well. The [[rel-me]] and [[WordPress with Bridgy#Rel-me links]] pages can provide additional information if necessary.

If you view the source for your website afterwards, you'll see a number of links like <code><link rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/username" /></code> in the <code><head></code>. If you want the links to be visible on your site, you can use the rel-me widget, which will replace the hidden links with icons.

Now that your site has rel-me links pointing to your presences on several services, log into those services and include the URL of your site in the appropriate website fields of your profile so that they point back to your website in return. Having the ability to add rel-me links in your sites helps to indicate your ownership of them. 

Some services like Twitter and Instagram, which only allow one URL in your profile, support putting a second URL into your bio field if you have second personal site. Examples: {{kevinmarks}} and  {{chrisaldrich}} have [https://indieweb.org/multi-site_indieweb indiewebified  primary and secondary sites].

If your site has multiple Wordpress users, and you want to use it as an Indieweb site for one of the users, change the Indieweb identity settings in its "Options" pane:
* click IndieWeb in the admin sidebar
* click Options under the IndieWeb item in the admin sidebar
* In the main window:
** Check: '''Single Author Site [x]'''
** Pick yourself in '''Default Author _____v''' drop down menu.
** Save Changes

You can now '''test''' your rel-me setup with: [http://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ IndieWebify.Me Web Sign In validator]

'''Nota bene''': In late July 2016, [http://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ IndieWebify.Me] was [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/47 having problems] which may cause it to return incorrect results. If you think this may be the case, you can do an additional test described in "Authentication" below.


== Installing from a downloaded source ==
(Seemed a tad bit too advanced)
* Download a .zip file of the theme you want from either the repository or another trusted source
* Login to your site
* From the administrative user interface go to the menu options Appearance >> Themes
* Click the "Add New" button
* Click on the "Upload Theme" button. 
* On the next page, click "Choose File" and select the .zip file for your theme and select it within your operating system. 
* Click on the "Install Now" button in WordPress.
* Finally, to make the theme active, click the "Activate" link on the resultant page.
* Your site should now have the new theme active and ready to go.
