'''Plugins'''

The WordPress community also connects with the larger IndieWeb using plugins, these are add-ons to WordPress that introduce new functionality. There are a number of IndieWeb plugins you will need to install. Sometimes these plugins can conflict with your current theme.

If this happens you are again left with the choice of editing your theme or choosing a new one.

'''Post Types'''

The IndieWeb also uses specific types of post, or post-types, that look follow semantic rules, which basically means how the microformats markup works. IndieWeb WordPress themes handle post types differently.

Each post types have specific rules a user should follow. For example notes should not get a tielte even though there will be a field in WordPress to add a note title.


While each plug-in is described in further detail below it is important to note you do not need to install all the plugins when using a 100% IndieWeb comptaible theme. Install the microformats plugin since the mark up is built in. You also do not need the post-kind plug in because that uses a a different method than SemPress to build the different IndieWeb post types.

To get started you should still install the IndieWeb plugin. This plugin ads functionality and different plugins. Once installed you will need to activate webmentions and semantic linkbacks.


''''' Setting up your h-card'''''
To setup your h-card in SemPress use the IndieWeb plugin, add to your WordPress profile, then add the h-card widget to your homepage. 
You can alos manually add an hcard to your header or footer.

In 2016-Indieweb the h-card is included in the IndieWeb plug-in. You install the plug-in and then edit your WordPress profile. Go to users>my profile> and then fill in links to your other websites.

Then you can add an h-card widget to you hompage header, footer, or sidebar.

====2016-IndieWeb====
2016 is one of the most popular out of the box WordPress theme. An #IndieWeb compatible version is available on GitHub. To install the theme you can  [https://github.com/dshanske/twentysixteen-indieweb/archive/master.zip download the theme.] This is a .zip file. You do no even need to open it.

Then in WordPress go to Appearance>Theme>New Theme>Upload Theme>and select your .zip file.

You will need to check GitHub for periodic theme updates. You can star or watch a GitHub repo to learn of updates.


The theme allows you to set up a static homepage. To do this you need to go to Customize>Homepage>Select static homepage. You may need to create a new page where all your posts will get published.


If you want to syndicate posts using an IndieWeb plugin you should activate Brid.gy. There are other syndication tools described below as well.

Finally if you want to publish to your WordPress site using a third party IndieWeb client, like an Android app or iOS app for example, you will need to activate the micropub plug-in.


== Testing Your Current Theme ==
If you love the way your theme looks and want to find out if you can use it to connect to the large IndieWeb community then follow the tutorial below.

Be forewarned many themes, especially ones with all of the bells and whistles, may not be compatible with IndieWeb plugins without theme editing that is beyond the skill level of even the most experienced WordPress users.

When you are done we will walk you through how to test the site or you can stop our chat at https://chat.indieweb.org and ask for help with testing, or at any time during your set up process

== Using a Non-Compliant Theme ==
You may find your theme or plugin set up is not compatible with IndieWeb pulgins. This will happen often. You are now faced with teh choice of changign your theme and design or giving up on the #IndieWeb.



== Brainstorming ==
* Where possible move some of the "theme cruft" to one of the pages to that specific theme.
** Perhaps include h-cards and how the are or aren't handled
* Try not to get too far into the weeds on theme issues


= Move somewhere else =
The following chunks should be moved to appropriate pages:

== Hosted at WordPress.com ==
TK -- move this to a wordpress.com specific set up page

WordPress.com limits the plugins that you can use, so you'll need to use the WordPress menu and widget system.

If you're on the Business plan or higher, you can use the same plugin as above. If not, you'll need to use the WordPress menu and widget system.

* In the admin, go to Appearance > Menus
* Create a new menu
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me1.png]]
* Click ''Screen Options'' at the top and check the box to display ''Link Relationships (XFN)''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me2.png]]
* Click ''Custom Links'' and add the link to your profile, e.g <nowiki>https://twitter.com/username</nowiki>. Enter the link text and click ''Add to Menu''. Repeat for as many profile links as you want to add.
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me3.png]]
* Under ''Menu Structure'' click the arrow beside the newly-added link. In the ''Link Relationship (XFN)'' field enter <kbd>me</kbd> and click ''Save''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me4.png]]
* Go to Appearance > Widgets
* Drag a ''Custom Menu'' widget into the ''Sidebar''
* Click the arrow to expand the ''Custom Menu'', select the menu you created, then click ''Save''
** [[File:WordPress-com-rel-me5.png]]
* Your profile links should now appear in your sidebar, or wherever your theme places the widget.

== Rel-me ==
{{main|rel-me}}

Removed this section in lieu of IndieAuth plugin which supercedes most of the functionality.

One of the first things you will want to set up are [[rel-me]] links to your other profiles on the web. This will enable [[web-sign-in]] and [[IndieAuth]] using your domain as your identity. You can then sign into this wiki and begin [[wikifying]].

The easiest way to add rel="me" support to your site is to install the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/installation/ Indieweb Plugin]. This will add several common social media site fields to your "Edit User" page in the admin panel at <nowiki>yoursite.example.com/wp-admin/profile.php</nowiki>. (Be sure to change this URL to include your particular domain.) Fill these in with the usernames for your identities on the various services you use (Telephone, Github username, Twitter username (without @), Facebook ID, Last.fm username, Instagram username, Flickr username) and the plugin will create the proper (invisible) rel-me links in the head of your site. There is a field at the bottom of the "Edit User" page that one can list additional URLs for adding rel-me to as well. The [[rel-me]] and [[WordPress with Bridgy#Rel-me links]] pages can provide additional information if necessary.

If you view the source for your website afterwards, you'll see a number of links like <code><link rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/username" /></code> in the <code><head></code>. If you want the links to be visible on your site, you can use the rel-me widget, which will replace the hidden links with icons.

Now that your site has rel-me links pointing to your presences on several services, log into those services and include the URL of your site in the appropriate website fields of your profile so that they point back to your website in return. Having the ability to add rel-me links in your sites helps to indicate your ownership of them. 

Some services like Twitter and Instagram, which only allow one URL in your profile, support putting a second URL into your bio field if you have second personal site. Examples: {{kevinmarks}} and  {{chrisaldrich}} have [https://indieweb.org/multi-site_indieweb indiewebified  primary and secondary sites].

If your site has multiple Wordpress users, and you want to use it as an Indieweb site for one of the users, change the Indieweb identity settings in its "Options" pane:
* click IndieWeb in the admin sidebar
* click Options under the IndieWeb item in the admin sidebar
* In the main window:
** Check: '''Single Author Site [x]'''
** Pick yourself in '''Default Author _____v''' drop down menu.
** Save Changes

You can now '''test''' your rel-me setup with: [http://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ IndieWebify.Me Web Sign In validator]

'''Nota bene''': In late July 2016, [http://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ IndieWebify.Me] was [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/47 having problems] which may cause it to return incorrect results. If you think this may be the case, you can do an additional test described in "Authentication" below.


== Installing from a downloaded source ==

* Login to your site
* From the administrative user interface go to the menu options Appearance >> Themes
* Click the "Add New" button
