== My Personal Itch ==

I may think about switching my personal blog from a custom Django backend to static published with Hugo (as the music blog is).

I'm into content-addressed storage. I wrote a CAS based distributed image storage/thumbnailing service: http://thraxil.github.io/reticulum/
and then a more generalized version: https://github.com/thraxil/cask/ Now, though, IPFS looks like a better long-term bet, so I might play with replacing some of my setup with that.
