<p class="p-summary"> Hi! Im Daniel Mowitz (which is pronounced as: [ˈdɑnjəl mʊwɪts]). I live in Germany and currently study physics and occasionally write some code. Additionally, I dabble in philosophy, music, ham radio (my callsign is DK5MD) and whatever else interests me from day to day. I really enjoy riding my bike. I am a white, cis man and use he/him/his pronouns.</p>
