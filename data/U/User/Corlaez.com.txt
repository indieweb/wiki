I learnt recently about this community and I am on board with what is going on in this space. After reading for a few days I am happy to announce that corlaez.com implements a representative h-card footer, joined the indieweb webring and added support for receiving webmentions (webmentions publication is still manual for now).

My website is written in a Kotlin static site generator I wrote myself. Posts are written in markdown (with the first lines of the markdown files reserved for metadata) and templates use an HTML DSL library. My site is fully internationalized to English and Spanish. I would like to push the limitations of static sites and incorporate indieweb tech into my blog.

== Itches/Working on ==
* Working on Legal and Privacy policy terms. I wish there was a dead simple way to declare my site is read only, I won't collect or store an of your personal info. However, I need to understand how does my hosting provider relate to all that...
* Remove h-entry tags from mi free form board and legal page
* Learn more about indie auth and what it provides in contrast to relmeauth
* Figure out the best microsub for me and start using it

== Icebox ==

* Add some code to ease the creation of webmentions of other webs from my website (I decided not to implement webmentions myself due to complexity and the dopamine triggering effects of likes and comments shared publicly. Not sure if I should participate by writting and sending my own likes and comments, seems inconsistent)
