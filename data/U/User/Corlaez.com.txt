I learnt recently about this community and I am on board with what is going on in this space. After reading for a few days I am happy to announce that corlaez.com implements a representative h-card footer, joined the indieweb webring and added support for receiving webmentions (webmentions publication is still manual for now).

== Website ==

My website is written in a Kotlin static site generator I wrote myself. Posts are written in markdown (with the first lines of the markdown files reserved for metadata) and templates use an HTML DSL library. My site is fully internationalized to English and Spanish. I would like to push the limitations of static sites and incorporate indieweb tech into my blog.


One of the features of my website is a plugin system that I can use to modularize features. Each plugin can add HTML scripts links or visual markup in designated places such as head nav or my footer. In addition to that each plugin can add code to the static generation adding their own files.

    val webPlugins = listOf(
        BlogPlugin(),
        NotesPlugin(),
        BoardPlugin(),
        LegalPlugin(),
        DevPlugin(DevCss.BORDER),
        MermaidPlugin(false),
        WebMentionPlugin(false),
        IndieWebRingPlugin(),
        IndieAuthPlugin(),
    ).filter { it.enabled }

My website also makes heavy use of experimental Kotlin features, especially context receivers that is seen  in all parts of the code including the plugin system

UPDATE: I am not posting much at all in my website, it doesn't have a database and relies on static web generation. In other words is not smooth, I may nuke it and start something from scratch that it is better set up for ease of use and authoring of new posts

The plugin paradigm, has also complicated a lot of my code. Pages or group of pages plugins make sense (like blob, notes board, etc) but feature based plugin has been a flop in terms of complexity.

== Capsule (Gemini) ==

As of January 2025 and after around 3 years of first learning about Gemini, I finally decided to get a VPS and implement my own gemini server from scratch. Check my chess app: gemini://gem.corlaez.com/chess or https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gem.corlaez.com/chess

== Itches/Working on ==
* I want to make my website easier to update, not sure how much simpler do I want to make it. 
* I am working on my gemini implementation of chess
* I have an itch to start working on client auth for my chess game

== Icebox ==

* Add some code to ease the creation of webmentions of other webs from my website (I decided not to implement webmentions myself due to complexity and the dopamine triggering effects of likes and comments shared publicly. Not sure if I should participate by writting and sending my own likes and comments, seems inconsistent)
