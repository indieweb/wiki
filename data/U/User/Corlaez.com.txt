I learnt recently about this community and I am so onboard with what is going on in this space. After reading for a few days I am happy that corlaez.com implements a representative (and stealthy) h-card footer, joined indieweb webring and added support for receiving webmentions.

== Itches ==
* Reveive my first webmentions (and check that I can receive them without issues)
* Add some code to ease the creation of webmentions of other webs from my website
* Mark up articles with h-entry related classes
* Figure out the best microsub for me and start using it
