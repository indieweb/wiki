I learnt recently about this community and I am on board with what is going on in this space. After reading for a few days I am happy to announce that corlaez.com implements a representative h-card footer, joined the indieweb webring and added support for receiving webmentions (webmentions publication is still manual for now).

My website is written in a Kotlin static site generator I wrote myself. Posts are written in markdown (with the first lines of the markdown files reserved for metadata) and templates use an HTML DSL library. I would like to push the limitations of static sites and incorporate indieweb tech into my blog.

== Itches/Working on ==
* Reveive my first webmentions (and check that I can receive them without issues)
* Add some code to ease the creation of webmentions of other webs from my website
* Mark up articles with h-entry related classes
* Figure out the best microsub for me and start using it
