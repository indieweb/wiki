=== IndieWeb Projects I use ===
A home-rolled Node app based somewhat on [https://github.com/cliss/camel Camel] from [https:///www.caseyliss.com Casey Liss] that I've dubbed Koala.

I've previously used [[WordPress]] and [[Jekyll]], and played around with [[Known]], but wanted some experience writing Node and building out functionality myself.

Things are working pretty well, but I need a better way to handle quick posting. My current workflow requires Git commits, and there is too much friction for providing regular posts. As such, I find myself falling off the POSSE wagon. Once I remove most of this friction, I plan to start on adding [[Micropub]] functionality.
