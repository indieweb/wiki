=== IndieWeb Projects I use ===
A home-rolled Node app originally based strongly on [https://github.com/cliss/camel Camel] from [https:///www.caseyliss.com Casey Liss], but highly modified that I've dubbed Koala.

I've previously used [[WordPress]] and [[Jekyll]], and played around with [[Known]], but wanted some experience writing Node and building out functionality myself.

Things are working pretty well, but I need a better way to handle quick posting. My previous workflow required Git commits, requiring too much friction for providing regular posts. I’ve added basic [[Micropub]] functionality for simple, text-based updates, but still cannot post images or any other post types.

=== What’s Next ===

I’m struggling to determine my next step forward. I’m a complete and total hack when it comes to my current site. I’m not truly a Node developer, but I have made some real progress. Part of me wants to just switch to an IndieWeb tricked out [[WordPress]] install, because it will more easily and simply get me the possibly to get [[Webmentions]], media [[Micropub]] posts, [[replies]], [[likes]] and [[reposts]]. Those are all things I have to learn and implement personally if I want to get it on my site. I don’t really want to deal with maintaining WordPress, and I know nothing about Gutenberg, but I also feel … overwhelmed, or maybe, lost … in implementing all of those items for my current site.

Additionally, all my posts are simple markdown files with a YAML header, basically in the Jekyll style. I have no idea, at this time, how I plan to handle mentions, replies to my posts, likes, reposts, etc. And what if I want to add stuff like food I eat, drinks I consume, workouts I complete, etc. Just more markdown files? What about feeds for these various types? It seems like a database would be nice, but I get the arguments for a database an anti-pattern, and I have no desire to pay more to run a database I don’t need. And yet…

As such, I’m trying to decide, exactly, what’s next.
