Pretty much I'm AlisonW everywhere, and where I'm not I'm AlisonWheeler. Based in and just north of London, England I've been hacking computers and what goes on them for ::cough::45 years::cough::. 
Mozillian, Wikimedian, geek.

I've used a range of options for my personal sites over the years, from hand-written html through off-the-shelf stuff to my own systems, but always on my own servers. Recently I've been trying out '''known''' (at https://alisonw.uk/) but while it's great for many things I'm finding it too limiting for some of my wants and too overkill for other needs. As such I've been revising the system I wrote in around 2013 with updated indieweb concepts now baked in which is being worked on offline and at https://alisonw.com/
