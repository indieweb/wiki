I'm Cidney. I'm an independent game developer. I'm a Central Florida native (it's not as bad as it sounds, I promise!), but have also lived in Boston, Paris, and New York.

I worked as a web developer until 2015, first as a freelancer and then for various tech companies. I absolutely remember Geocities! I was an early adopter of Facebook in 2004, back when it was only available to the Ivy League/Seven Sisters, and was always concerned about the lack of privacy and the impact it'd have on online discourse. The more time has passed, the more this concern has been validated!

The IndieWeb came up during a talk at AdaCamp in 2015. I've always owned my domain, but for the past five years it's just been a placeholder. My website is [[IndieMark#Level_1]].
