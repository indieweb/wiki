==Audio Set up==
<ol>
 	<li>You then be asked to select your default input and output device.</li>
 	<li>Next you will complete a series of audio input and volume output tests.</li>
 	<li>We will use push to talk so the audio test are not critical.</li>

 	<li>I could not run the test with large amounts of feedback with my Blue Yeti mic</li>
 	<li>On the next screen select push to talk</li>
 	<li>If you are using a mouse you can assign a button to push to talk. You can also assign a keyboard shortcut.</li>
</ol>
