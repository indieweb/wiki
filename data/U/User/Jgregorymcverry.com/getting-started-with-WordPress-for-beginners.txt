== Welcome to IndieWeb WordPress ==

The IndieWeb is about controlling your own identity by writing and building on a domain that you own. Your content is yours. 

If you use a blog or website, even if it isn't on your own domain like a wordpress.com site you are part of the #IndieWeb.

The IndieWeb is also about connecting with people who have a set of shared values about owning your content and controlling your identity. A suite of  special tools, which are available for people who have a Wordpress.org installation, is available.

This tutorial will walk you through setting up the community aspect on your WordPress site. It assumes you have a domain of your own with a version of WordPress running.

== A Brief Overview of Themes ==

People choose WordPress because of flexibility. There are thousands of themes to choose from. Each theme may behave differently.

As you start your IndieWeb journey you will have to think about your theme. Do you want to try and stick with your current theme or try one of three themes we know are 100% IndieWeb compatible?

Both approaches will work, however some functionality of IndieWeb WordPress plugins can be lost on some themes. Using your current theme may work but it will require additional testing and plugins.

[[What makes an IndieWeb Theme Work?]]

At the heart of the IndieWeb community is a tiny bit of code, or metadata, that gets added to your html. This metadata is called microformats2 (hence known as microfortmats). 

How this metadata gets read by other IndieWeb websites, apps, and tools makes everything work. Sometimes a theme will not properly display microformats. Other times specific types of posts like photos for example, will not display the metadata correctly once you publish.

This means you either have to edit your theme, which may not be possible for most users, or try a new theme.

The WordPress community also connects with the larger IndieWeb using plugins, these are add-ons to WordPress that introduce new functionality. There are a number of IndieWeb plugins you will need to install. Sometimes these plugins can conflict with your current theme.

If this happens you are again left with the choice of editing your theme or choosing a new one.

[[IndieWeb Compatible Themes]]

Currently there are only three fully functional IndieWeb WordPress themes. However the community is 
working on testing existing themes and making new ones every day. The themes are:

[[Testing Your Current Theme]]

If you love the way your theme looks and want to find out if you can use it to connect to the large IndieWeb community then follow the tutorial below.

When you are done we will walk you through how to test the site or you can stop our chat at https://chat.indieweb.org and ask for help with testing, or at any time during your set up process

Getting Started

The IndieWeb Plugin can help you establish your identity online, as well as recommending other plugins to support additional Indieweb features.

    Complete your user profile, adding in connections to other websites. This allows you to connect your identity on those sites to your website.
    Under Options on the Indieweb menu in the sidebar, set whether this is a single author or multi-author site
    Links to your various sites will now appear on your site, allowing you to use Indieauth and other services. If you want them visible to site visitors, you can add the rel-me widget to your site.

Plugins

After you have established your identity, you can now log into the Indieweb wiki and add a user page as a way of introducing yourself to the community. The wiki is also a great source of IndieWeb information

    Install and activate the Webmentions and Semantic Linkbacks plugins. These will allow you to receive responses such as replies, likes, etc from other Indieweb sites. You can configure it in the Discussion Settings
    Install and activate the Micropub and IndieAuth plugins. The Micropub plugin will allow you to publish to your website using Micropub and the IndieAuth plugin adds an IndieAuth endpoint to allow it to authenticate to your site. Without it, the Micropub plugin will use a third-party IndieAuth server to authenticate to your site.
    You can now install the Bridgy plugin. It will add its settings options under Indieweb and allow you to directly register for Bridgy to connect your blog to responses from sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
    Browse the Extensions page for a list of other recommended Indieweb plugins that can expand your functionality.

Install Plugins
Themes

The IndieWeb uses microformats 2 to mark up sites so that they can be interpreted by other sites when retrieved.

The Microformats 2 Plugin attempts to add microformats to a theme that does not support them. This is not a replacement for a correctly configured theme and does not work with all themes.

Formatting your site so other sites can consume the information allows for the communications IndieWeb sites support. Most tools will attempt to use means other than Microformats2 if they are not available, but will lack detail.

Currently, SemPress is the only theme in the WordPress repository that is fully microformats2 compliant. Independent Publisher has been updated to include basic microformats2 and webmention display support. In practice, most themes will work relatively well out of the box, though there can be some minor display issues. If you are interested in receiving help in converting your theme to support Microformats 2, the community will be happy to assist.
What is the IndieWeb?

Own your data. Create and publish content on your own site, and only optionally syndicate to third-party silos.

This is the basis of the IndieWeb. For more, see principles and why.

== IndieWeb Plug-In Description ==

----


The IndieWeb Plugin for WordPress helps you establish your IndieWeb identity by extending the user profile to provide rel-me and
h-card fields and optionally adding widgets to display this. It also includes a bundled installer for a core set of IndieWeb-related plugins. It’s
meant to be a one-stop shop to help WordPress users quickly and easily join the growing IndieWeb movement (see below).

Some of these plugins allow you to:

    send and receive comments, likes, reposts, and other kinds of post responses using your own site
    allow comments on others’ sites to show up as comments on your posts
    help make IndieWeb comments and mentions look better on your site
    allow support for webmentions
    provide basic support for Microformats 2
    add location support to your posts
    more easily syndicate your content to other sites to take advantage of network effects and other communities while still owning all of your original content
    link to syndicated versions of a post so that comments on your content in silos like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+ can come back to your original post as comments there
    set up a MicroPub Server to use other posting interfaces. (You could potentially use services like Instagram, Foursquare, and others to post to your WordPress site.)
    Use your site to log into other services with IndieAuth.

The IndieWeb

The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’ that allows you to be the hub of your own web presence. It’s been written about in Wired, The Atlantic, Slate, and Gigaom amongst others.
The IndieWeb, like WordPress, feels that your content is yours

When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users’ data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.
The IndieWeb is here to help you be better connected

Your articles and status messages can be syndicated to all services, not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone in your social network/social graph. Even replies and likes on other services can come back to your site so they’re all in one place.
