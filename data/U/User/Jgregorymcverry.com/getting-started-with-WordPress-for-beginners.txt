== Welcome to IndieWeb WordPress ==

The IndieWeb is about controlling your own identity by writing and building on a domain that you own. Your content is yours. 

If you use a blog or website, even if it isn't on your own domain like a wordpress.com site you are part of the #IndieWeb.

The IndieWeb is also about connecting with people who have a set of shared values about owning your content and controlling your identity. A suite of  special tools, which are available for people who have a Wordpress.org installation, is available.

This tutorial will walk you through setting up the community aspect on your WordPress site. It assumes you have a domain of your own with a version of WordPress running.

== A Brief Overview of Themes ==

People choose WordPress because of flexibility. There are thousands of themes to choose from. Each theme may behave differently.

As you start your IndieWeb journey you will have to think about your theme. Do you want to try and stick with your current theme or try one of four themes we know are 100% IndieWeb compatible?

Both approaches will work, however some functionality of IndieWeb WordPress plugins can be lost on some themes. Using your current theme may work but it will require additional testing and plugins.


===What makes an IndieWeb Theme Work?===

At the heart of the IndieWeb community is a tiny bit of code, or metadata, that gets added to your html. This metadata is called microformats2.

'''microformats2'''

How this metadata gets read by other IndieWeb websites, apps, and tools makes everything work. Sometimes a theme will not properly display microformats2. Other times specific types of posts like photos for example, will not display the metadata correctly once you publish.

This means you either have to edit your theme, which may not be possible for most users, or try a new theme.

'''Plugins'''

The WordPress community also connects with the larger IndieWeb using plugins, these are add-ons to WordPress that introduce new functionality. There are a number of IndieWeb plugins you will need to install. Sometimes these plugins can conflict with your current theme.

If this happens you are again left with the choice of editing your theme or choosing a new one.

'''Post Types'''

The IndieWeb also uses specific types of post, or post-types, that look follow semantic rules, which basically means how the microformats markup works. IndieWeb WordPress themes handle post types differently.

Each post types have specific rules a user should follow. For example notes should not get a tielte even though there will be a field in WordPress to add a note title.

''' Webmentions '''

The IndieWeb community is connected together through webmentions. These allow post on your site to show up as comments on somebody elses posts and allows some content on social media like Twitter to show as comments on your WordPress site.

Be forewarned many themes, especially ones with all of the bells and whistles, may not be compatible with IndieWeb plugins without theme editing that is beyond the skill level of even the most experienced WordPress users.

When you are done we will walk you through how to test the site or you can stop our chat at https://chat.indieweb.org and ask for help with testing, or at any time during your set up process

== Using a Non-Compliant Theme ==

You may find your theme or plugin set up is not compatible with IndieWeb pulgins. This will happen often. You are now faced with teh choice of changign your theme and design or giving up on the #IndieWeb.

However, there are a number of strategies you can use to keep your theme:
* '''Use a subdomain''' Here you keep you main WordPress for long form writing and then set up a subdomain like https://mystream.myblog.com and install an IndieWeb friendly theme on the subdomain.

Other people may use a different IndieWeb software on the subdomain such as https://micro.blog or https://withknown.com

* '''Use a Page Builder''' A major reason users may shy away from IndieWeb WordPress is the lack of visually driven themes. You can use a page builder on your homepage if you want to design a feature rich splash or homepage for your blog. 

First set up your website with a static homepage and publish your posts to a new page. You can do this from your WordPress dashboard by selecting "Customize"

Then on your static homepage install a page builder plugin such as [https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/ Page Builder by Site Origins], [https://elementor.com/ elementor], or [https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/ Beaver Builder].
