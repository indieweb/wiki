== Welcome to IndieWeb WordPress ==

The IndieWeb is about controlling your own identity by writing and building on a domain that you own. Your content is yours. 

If you use a blog or website, even if it isn't on your own domain like a wordpress.com site you are part of the #IndieWeb.

The IndieWeb is also about connecting with people who have a set of shared values about owning your content and controlling your identity. A suite of  special tools, which are available for people who have a Wordpress.org installation, is available.

This tutorial will walk you through setting up the community aspect on your WordPress site. It assumes you have a domain of your own with a version of WordPress running.

== A Brief Overview of Themes ==

People choose WordPress because of flexibility. There are thousands of themes to choose from. Each theme may behave differently.

As you start your IndieWeb journey you will have to think about your theme. Do you want to try and stick with your current theme or try one of three themes we know are 100% IndieWeb compatible?

Both approaches will work, however some functionality of IndieWeb WordPress plugins can be lost on some themes. Using your current theme may work but it will require additional testing and plugins.


===What makes an IndieWeb Theme Work?===

At the heart of the IndieWeb community is a tiny bit of code, or metadata, that gets added to your html. This metadata is called microformats2 (hence known as microfortmats).

'''microformats'''

How this metadata gets read by other IndieWeb websites, apps, and tools makes everything work. Sometimes a theme will not properly display microformats. Other times specific types of posts like photos for example, will not display the metadata correctly once you publish.

This means you either have to edit your theme, which may not be possible for most users, or try a new theme.

'''Plugins'''

The WordPress community also connects with the larger IndieWeb using plugins, these are add-ons to WordPress that introduce new functionality. There are a number of IndieWeb plugins you will need to install. Sometimes these plugins can conflict with your current theme.

If this happens you are again left with the choice of editing your theme or choosing a new one.

'''Post Types'''

The IndieWeb also uses specific types of post, or post-types, that look follow semantic rules, which basically means how the microformats markup works. IndieWeb WordPress themes handle post types differently.

Each post types have specific rules a user should follow. For example notes should not get a tielte even though there will be a field in WordPress to add a note title.

''' Webmentions '''

The IndieWeb community is connected together through webmentions. These allow post on your site to show up as comments on somebody elses posts and allows some content on social media like Twitter to show as comments on your WordPress site. 

=== IndieWeb Compatible Themes ===

[[SemPress]]

[[ZenPress]]

[[indpendent]]

[[2016 fork]]

==== SemPress ====

SemPress is a 100% compatible #IndieWeb theme. It also has other metadata from schema.org and the older version of microformats.

''''' Post Types'''''

The theme uses custom post types for aside, status, gallery, video, audio, chat, quote, link and image.

''''' Additional Pages '''''

The theme is not set up for a static homepage. Meaning if you want your posts to publish to a different page then your front page you should choose a different theme.

''''' Required Plugins '''''

While each plug-in is described in further detial below it is important to note you do not need to install all the plugins when using a 100% IndieWeb comptaible theme. Install the microformats plugin since the mark up is built in. You also do not need the post-kind plug in because that uses a a different method than SemPress to build the different IndieWeb post types.

To get started you should still install the IndieWeb plugin. This plugin ads functionality and different plugins. Once installed you will need to activate webmentions and semantic linkbacks.

'''''Optional Plugins'''''

If you want to syndicate posts using an IndieWeb plugin you should activate Brid.gy. There are other syndication tools described below as well.

Finally if you want to publish to yoru WordPress site using a third party IndieWeb client, like an Android app or iOS app for example, you will need to activate the micropub plug-in.

You can find more in depth directions on setting up SemPress on the wiki. 

== Testing Your Current Theme ==

If you love the way your theme looks and want to find out if you can use it to connect to the large IndieWeb community then follow the tutorial below.

Be forewarned many themes, especially ones with all of the bells and whistles, may not be compatible with IndieWeb plugins without theme editing that is beyond the skill level of even the most experienced WordPress users.



When you are done we will walk you through how to test the site or you can stop our chat at https://chat.indieweb.org and ask for help with testing, or at any time during your set up process
