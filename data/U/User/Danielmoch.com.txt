Again, I live in the Orlando, FL area. I'd like to stress that I'm very interested in seeing an IndieWeb movement in the area. The [[Planning#Florida | Planning]] page seems to be the current rally point for this. If you live in Florida and want to see this happen, send me an email!

== Status ==
[https://danielmoch.com/ danielmoch.com] is currently compliant up to and including Level 2, Step 1 of [https://indiewebify.me indiewebify.me]. However, this does not get me as far on [[IndieMark]]. Going forward I'll probably bounce my site design off of both since I'm still trying to figure out best practices.

== Done ==
# <code>rel="me"</code> added to all links that I'm able to link back to my site
# Added <code>h-card</code> and <code>h-entry</code> to all blog posts

== Itches ==
These are roughly in priority order
# Implement channels (see [[POSSE]])

# Out of desire to keep everything [[curlable]], I probably need to get away from the static website in favor of something smarter when it comes to handling [[webmentions]]. It should also implement a [[Micropub]] endpoint (which means we also need [[IndieAuth]]).
# Implement an [[h-feed]]. Keep RSS around as well, as it still seems pretty popular with non-IndieWeb folks.
# Implement a [[Microsub]] endpoint for my own use.
