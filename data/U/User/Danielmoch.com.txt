== Status ==
[https://danielmoch.com/ danielmoch.com] is currently compliant up to and including Level 2, Step 1 of [https://indiewebify.me indiewebify.me]. However, this does not get me as far on [[IndieMark]]. Going forward I'll probably bounce me site design off of both since I'm still trying to figure out best practices.

== Done ==
# <code>rel="me"</code> added to all links that I'm able to link back to my site
# Added <code>h-card</code> and <code>h-entry</code> to all blog posts

== TODO (Itches) ==
# Implement channels (e.g. notesâ€”see [[POSSE]])
# Determine path forward for incorporating active elements (e.g., webmentions). I need to decide whether I'm okay with JavaScript helping dynamically update and display mentions/replies. This may violate the "[[IndieMark#Level 1|if you can't curl it, it's not the web]]" tenet.
