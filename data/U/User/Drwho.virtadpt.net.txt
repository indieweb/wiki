Since migrating [https://drwho.virtadpt.net/ my site] back to [https://blog.getpelican.com/ static HTML] I can finally set up Indieauth.  I used [https://github.com/inklings-io/selfauth Selfauth] because I wanted something simple and lightweight to experiment with.  Much to my surprise, it works.

I guess I should put a profile here.
