It's me, {{danq}}!

When I'm not fantasising about having more time to do IndieWeb stuff I work as a software engineer by day and run the volunteer development team at [https://www.threerings.org.uk/ a non-profit that provides software to charities] by night.

I've been developing web sites since the mid 1990s, and blogging (currently at [https://danq.me/ danq.me]) since the late 1990s.
