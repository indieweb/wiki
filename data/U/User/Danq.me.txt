Is Dan Q.

When he's not fantasising about having more time to do IndieWeb stuff, he looks after the websites of the [http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/ libraries of the University of Oxford] and runs the volunteer development team at [https://www.threerings.org.uk/ a non-profit that provides software to charities].

He's been developing web sites since the mid 1990s, and he's been running a blog (currently at [https://danq.me/ danq.me]) since the late 1990s.
