I work in a career services office in higher education.

== Site ==
* [https://davekokandy.com davekokandy.com] currently runs on [[Wordpress]] using the IWC plugins and ZenPress theme.
* I also have experimented with [[Known]] in the past, currently at [https://known.davekokandy.com]


== Itches ==
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* Start posting [[notes]] manually at [[permalinks]]
* Try checking my site in indiewebify.me
* Figure out a better way to integrate Known with my website?
* [[GnuSocial]]?
