= My Indieweb Setup =

[https://kiko.io kiko.io] is my primary and only website/blog where I post [https://kiko.io/archives/ Articles], [https://kiko.io/notes/ Notes] and [https://kiko.io/photos/ Photos].

The static site is based on the Node.js driven SSG [https://hexo.io Hexo] and is hosted on [https://pages.github.com/ GitHub Pages], where it is build via GitHub Actions everytime a commit takes place. After the build an extra Action runs a custom Hexo Console Command, which sends Webmentions to external URL's of the latest post.

For receiving Webmentions and Pingbacks [https://webmention.io webmention.io] is configured as endpoint and linked in the header of every page. Likewise, [https://indieauth.com indieauth.com] is configured as the authorization endpoint for Indieweb services.

POSSE is done manually on platforms like [https://indieweb.social Mastodon] and [https://pixelfed.social Pixelfed] and other non-fediverse services. The resulting syndication links are also entered in the corresponding Frontmatter of the posts MD files by hand and committed. All syndication links are displayed under a post.

Interactions with the syndications are collected from the platforms (or brid.gy) via the [https://github.com/kristofzerbe/Mentions-United '''Mentions United'''] client JavaScript solution and also shown below the post.
