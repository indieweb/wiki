Hi, I'm {{simonesilvestroni}}, I create and produce sound and music across multiple media and make websites using Jekyll or WordPress. I started working in the publishing industry in 1994 and transitioned to web design a year later, becoming an expert in web standards. Iâ€™m also a professional bass player, a composer and a field recordist.

My timezone is Europe/Rome, currently based in Milan after spending the last ten years in the UK, between London and Cambridge.
