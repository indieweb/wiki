Hello World!

I live at https://inhji.de

== Projects ==


<s>Currently working on my personal homepage, codename Yamato.
Yamato is a server-rendered website using Express.js/Node.js
Right now, it only supports posting notes.</s>
I've stopped the development of Yamato. It was trying to be a one-fits-all solution and I realized that this approach just isn't working for me.


Currently working on my personal homepage/life dashboard, codename [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu Cthulhu]. It consists of several parts, all of which are up on Github. 

* [https://github.com/inhji/cthulhu-api chtulhu-api]: Where all the data comes from and goes to. Right now, it's a single GraphQL endpoint.
* [https://github.com/inhji/cthulhu-web cthulhu-web]: My private Dashboard.
* [https://github.com/inhji/cthulhu-public cthulhu-public]: My homepage.
* [https://github.com/inhji/cthulhu-android cthulhu-android]: An android app which is currently just a habit tracker.
