Hello World!

I live at https://inhji.de

== Projects ==

Currently working on my personal homepage, codename Yamato.
Yamato is a server-rendered website using Express.js/Node.js
Right now, it only supports posting notes.


== Planned Features ==

'''Counts''': To record how often I do stuff, like smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, etc.

'''POSSE''': Syndicating my posts to Facebook and Twitter through brid.gy

'''Saving Bookmarks''': Have an integrated bookmark saving service, like Pocket or [https://www.wallabag.org/ Wallabag], not sure if I should just use Wallabag
