Hi, I'm Jonathan!

I'm a person who codes .NET by day and Elixir by night. 

[https://inhji.de inhji.de] is my little indie cave on the web.
Check out the code on [https://github.com/inhji/akedia Github].

I love programming, listening to strange sounds, cats, soldering, and building my modular synthesizer.

'''Nov 11 2018''': First commit for Akedia on Github

'''Dec 12 2018''': I submitted the first micropub implementation report for my project [https://github.com/inhji/akedia Akedia] to [http://micropub.rocks micropub.rocks].  There's still much work to do but it's usable. Also, 200 commits milestone :)
