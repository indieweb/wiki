== My Setup ==
My website is running [[microblog.pub]], so it functions natively as a single-user ActivityPub instance, uses [[microformats]], and sends and receives [[webmentions]]. It sits behind the same reverse proxy as my personal [[Matrix]] [https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy instance], which has the side effect that my site drops offline when I'm updating Matrix.

== Itches ==
* I'm currently trying to wrap my head around what I ''can'' do and what I ''want'' to do as far as syndication and backfeed. I'm on the fence about whether I want to syndicate to Twitter, but I think I might like to get backfeed, and I'm not entirely sure how well the latter can work without the former. The lack of editing support on both ends means I can't include a [[u-syndication]] link in the original, either (without Twitter Blue, which ain't happening).
* [[microblog.pub]], as of this writing, [https://todo.sr.ht/~tsileo/microblog.pub/56 plans] to add support for editing notes, but doesn't have it yet. (Draft support is under consideration, but not planned.) I might try to figure out if I can help contribute to that.
* Permalinks are based on a UUID (truncated and with a slug appended for articles). I've got a nice short domain, and I'd kind of like to support shorter links, either by adding some kind of permashortlink support of my own or possibly by modifying the base software to use something else instead of the UUID, which - unlike the edit support - I feel like I might be able to accomplish without much research.
* I also think I want to set up somewhere to put things that I don't consider notes or articles, and things that I may want to edit regularly, such as perhaps a more detailed About Me page. I'd kind of like it to be something I don't have to ssh into my server to do. I have a few ideas for how I might accomplish this, but nothing very concrete yet.
