== Introduction ==
I'm Rina, sometimes Rina A., or Riri. I do not consider myself a developer but I've been tinkering with tech since forever. I've created my first website ever around 2010-2012, likely using some free templates. The first website I made myself was around 2017. So in short, I've been online since forever.

== My site: riri.my==
The website was originally under the domain name hoodie.lol, later changed to рина.орг. Since рина.орг looked sketchy when shared around (xn--80appk.xn--c1avg), I've decided to return to a domain name I've registered months prior - riri.my. I've deleted a website I've abandoned under that domain and moved my current website to it. So that's a short lore about my website's origin.

For a really long time, I've longed of having my very own slice of the internet, but I've never commited to it. Until NOW.

== Why .my ==
Sorry to potentially disapoint, but I'm not Malaysian, I'm Serbian. The reason I've got .my, is the same reason some people pick .me. It *sounds* personal. Think: my website, my chaos, my little digital brain dump.
