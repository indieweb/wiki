<DFN><b>Community norms</b></DFN> are the written and unwritten rules that members of a specific community abide by to foster connections between members and strengthen the shared vision and purpose of that community.

Like other communities, online and offline, IndieWeb has community norms that have been created over time and practiced in chat and at community events.

== IndieWeb Community Norms ==
This community strives to be welcoming and inclusive, and it has expectations of its community members, outlined in the Indieweb Principles and the Code of Conduct. There are also unspoken, more nuanced guidelines that are learned over time.

By participating in chat and other community events, you’re agreeing to not just the written rules, but you are also committing to learning about the unwritten rules within the community.
== Chat ==
=== Get To Know The Community ===
The IndieWeb community includes people from different backgrounds and skill levels who have joined together to explore topics such as creating personal websites, owning your online identity, and creating for people over algorithms.

=== Stay on Topic ===
*<b>IndieWeb Focus</b>
*<b>Chat Channel Topics</b> - Staying on topic in chat channels is important because it keeps discussions organized and makes it easier for members to participate in the topics they prefer.
* <b>#indieweb</b> is the main channel to introduce yourself and discuss most indieweb topics. A good rule of thumb is to keep discussions in this channel on topics that the average person would understand. 
* <b>#indieweb-cafe (#cafe in Slack)</b> - is a special channel that is treated like a chat in a cafe with a friend. Discussions in this channel are expected to stay in this channel. You may not quote, summarize, or otherwise share the contents unless you have permission from the user you'd like to quote.  
*<b>Discuss</b> outlines all chat channel purposes.

=== Off-Limit Topics ===
Certain topics are completely off-limits in chat, and there are some topics (or viewpoints surrounding some topics) that go against the ethos of the community.
*Anything that goes against the Code of Conduct.
*Money and Marketing topics, including SEO, how to make money with your website, and other marketing and capitalist topics. 

=== No Hello ===
<b>No Hello</b> is a concept that describes a preference in communication where, instead of saying "hello" or other similar greeting and waiting for a response, you go ahead and ask the question (and you can include the hello in that if you want). This saves both parties time, helps with personal task management, and ensures the receiving party consents to the exchange.
