__NOTOC__

== Setup ==

* I mainly use my own custom setup called '''[[Bundle]]'''.

* Django+MySQL with a lot of custom Python code, hosted on [https://www.webfaction.com/ Webfaction.com]

* Post types currently active: Article and Notes

* Webmentions sent to all links using [https://github.com/bear/ronkyuu ronkyuu]

* POSSE notes to Twitter using Bridgy/publish.

== Itch ==

		<p class="col-main">This is a list of things I want to get working on this site. It is more for my bookkeeping than your reading, but if you have suggestions for things or how to best &lsquo;scratch&rsquo; any of these, let me know!</p>

=== To do ===
	<ul class="pt-col-smallpull">

		<li> automate sending webmentions in some sane way. (Django post_save signal failed.)</li>

		<li> parse received webmentions using an asyc queue.</li>

		<li> move to a file-based storage (consider html+mf2) and use MySQL for meta-cache only. See <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/databases-antipattern" title="databases-antipattern" class="mw-redirect">databases-antipattern</a> <del datetime="2015-01-07">(responses to articles moved to YAML files.)</del> <del datetime="2017-05-05">Started <a href="https://github.com/kartikprabhu/pullback_note">Pullback-Note</a> to move notes from DB.</del> <ins datetime="2017-05-05">Started <a href="https://github.com/kartikprabhu/manifold_note">Manifold-Note</a> notes now stored in html+mf2+json files. Add delete and undelete. Change update to write only what is changed.</ins></li>

		<li>eliminate explicit post types (aricles vs notes) in DB?</li>

		<li>migrate bookmarks from Feedly</li>

		<li> use <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub">micropub</a> to build a good posting UI alternative to Django's admin.</li>

		<li> indie reader (far-future; look into <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/microsub">microsub</a>)</li>

		<li> better homepage idea: use homepage for updates, including status (like currently reading), latest notes and articles and also entry points to explore other things on the site. Reserve about page for info about self and site. Why?: homepage is where readers would land first, and presumably they are more interested in "what's new?"</li>

		<li> better reply-context and embedding.</li>

		<li> auto-linking (such as @username) in notes and responses</li>

		<li> chaining conversations.</li>

		<li> notifications for new activity such as new responses to posts</li>

		<li> self-host photos/art. move from Google and deviantArt. import old tweets and G+ posts to own site.</li>

		<li> move draft posts from old blogger site. put up move notice on posts with new URL.</li>

		<li>composite stream of all post-types</li>

		<li>accept webmentions from Twitter and G+ through form</li>

		<li>cleanup sub projects and put on Github for others to possibly use.</li>

		<li>accept webmentions linking to alternate URLs of posts e.g. https or http</li>

		<li>publish page listing replies to some URL. Useful to see all marginalia to some particular post/ebook.</li>

		<li>import ebook notes from Google Play to site as marginalia</li>

		<li>markup papers data with mf2 to represent all information like <abbr title="document object identifier">DOI</abbr> and journal-accepted versions.</li>

		<li>fix hfeed2atom to include response-context</li>

		<li>delete the responses container if all responses are marginalia. (might not actually be an issue IRL)</li>

	</ul>

=== Done ===
<ul class="pt-col-smallpull">

		<li> <del datetime="2014-04-22">Improve webmention parsing using mf2py.</del> (Done: as of at least 2014-04-22)</li>

		<li> <del datetime="2014-05-23">enable https and SSL stuff</del> (Done: as of 2014-05-23)</li>

		<li><del datetime="2014-07-10"> enable micro-level responses aka <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/annotations" title="annotations" class="mw-redirect">annotations</a> using <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/fragmention" title="fragmention">fragmention</a>.</del> (Done: on 2014-07-10 see: <a href="https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/marginalia-active">marginalia-active</a>)</li>

		<li> <del datetime="2014-04-23">receive mentions on Notes. (Hint: use url to identify posts instead of DB objects.)</del> (Done: as of 2014-04-23)</li>

		<li> <del datetime="2017-05-05">cache or lazy load avatars for improved performance</del> <ins datetime="2017-05-05">Done: cacheing avatars for a year using Google's image cache/resizing (see <a href="https://carlo.zottmann.org/posts/2013/04/14/google-image-resizer.html">Google's authentication-less, on-the-fly image resizing service</a>)</ins></li>

This interferes with fragmention for instance.</del> (Done as of 2017-01-14; responsive images have a placeholder of correct size until they load.)</li>

		<li><del datetime="2016-12-27">remove the over-zealous fragmention handling in receiving webmentions which assumes the double-hash “##” notation; use whatever URL is received. update marginalia to accept this.</del> (Done as of 2016-12-27)</li>

		<li><del datetime="2016-12-27">remove marginalia.js from notes (since it is useless there), and put only on article permalink pages.</del> (Done as of 2016-12-27)</li>
