I enjoy keeping up on all of the changes in technology, especially on the web front. My passion is for developing web-based applications and backend services to help businesses get more done. Give me a problem or challenge and I'll jump at the chance to find the solution. The question is never if something can be done it's just a matter of time and resources.
