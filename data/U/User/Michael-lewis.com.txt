Hi I'm [[User:Michael-lewis.com|Michael I Lewis]]. I set up my first web site back in 1994, and have noticed a few changes to the internet since then. My interests include trying to help make the internet as fun, exciting and as genuinely useful as it originally was.

== Side-project ==

* https://searchmysite.net/ - simple search for personal and independent websites - to improve the ability to find independent and personal websites, and provide a search as a service for site owners.
