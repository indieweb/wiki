Hi I'm [[User:Michael-lewis.com|Michael I Lewis]]. I set up my first web site back in 1994, but have been mostly developing sites and apps for other people since then. I like the IndieWeb as it is part of the reaction against the over-commercialisation of the internet and the problems that brings.

== Side-project ==

* https://searchmysite.net/ - simple search for personal and independent websites - to improve the ability to find independent and personal websites, and help make the internet as fun, exciting and as genuinely useful as it originally was.
