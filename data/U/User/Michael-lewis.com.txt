Hi I'm [[User:Michael-lewis.com|Michael I Lewis]]. I'm new to the IndieWeb community, although no stranger to the internet, having set up my first web site back in 1994.

* Help make the internet as fun, exciting and as genuinely useful as it originally was.
* Improve the discoverability of independent and personal websites.
