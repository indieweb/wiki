Hi I'm [[User:Michael-lewis.com|Michael I Lewis]]. I'm new to the IndieWeb community, although no stranger to the internet, having set up my first web site back in 1994. Last post on Facebook 31 Jan 2012: "I am just logging out and may be some time".

* Help make the internet as fun, exciting and as genuinely useful as it originally was.
* Improve the ability to find independent and personal websites.
