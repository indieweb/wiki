I'm best known for [[Bridgy]], a hosted service that does [[backfeed]] and
[[POSSE]] and adds [[webmention]] support to hosted blog platforms.
I also created and maintain
[[granary]], [[indie map]], [[Bridgy Fed]], [[huffduff-video]],
[https://oauth-dropins.appspot.com/ oauth-dropins], [[ownyourresponses]], [[Baffle]],
[https://twitter-atom.appspot.com/ twitter-atom],
[https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/ facebook-atom],
[https://instagram-atom.appspot.com/ instagram-atom], and more.

My web site is [https://snarfed.org/ snarfed.org]. It's [[WordPress]] with
IndieWeb plugins and minor tweaks. I [[POSSE]] posts manually, I use
[https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourresponses ownyourresponses] and
[https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourcheckin ownyourcheckin] to automatically
[[PESOS]] [[likes]], [[comments]], [[repost|retweets]], [[RSVPs]], and [[checkins]], and I use
[[Bridgy]] to backfeed silo responses.
