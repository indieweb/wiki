== A Run Through IndieWebify.Me using vanilla WP and twentyseventeen theme ==
WP Version: 4.9.6

=== Set up Web Sign ===
No changes, and I test ... "Something Went Wrong, no rel=me links could be found"
* Can indiewebify.me detect WP as the source and offer specific guidance here, smart onboarding for the win

So I start with the primary plugin, Indieweb plugin

== This Wiki ==
Haven't looked at the [[Getting Started on WordPress]] page until now. Whoa. That's a lot of stuff &hellip;

<blockquote>
ignore most other content, very dated, we are in the process of trying to split the pages one for theme developers, and one for users
<cite>jgmac1106 #wordpress 2018-06-07</cite></blockquote>

First impression of this page: lots of 'if' and 'should', I'm already lost, lol
 
I'll leave it alone because WIP.

== WordPress / Indie Ecosystem ==


=== Themes ===

These are fast, first impressions, by no means thorough, conclusive or even fair!
