== A Run Through IndieWebify.Me using vanilla WP and twentyseventeen theme ==
WP Version: 4.9.6

=== Set up Web Sign In ===
No changes, and I test ... "Something Went Wrong, no rel=me links could be found"
* Can indiewebify.me detect WP as the source and offer specific guidance here, smart onboarding for the win

So I start with the primary plugin, Indieweb plugin

Search via WP Dash -> Plugins -> Add new -> "IndieWeb" -- huzzah, I recognize the logo, success, installed and activated
* No new custom post types, hmmm. Not what I was expected (note: very beginner at all things IndieWebCamp)
* New IWC Menu. That Icon is on the blurry side though.
* That plugin description though "Interested in connecting your WordPress site to the IndieWeb?", yes &hellip;

Checking out this new plugin -- wow, a page full of info for me under Getting Started. Alright IWC, alright.
* I guess you want me to fill in my user profile. Look at all those new fields. okay. done.
* Side option multi/single author ---- it's already set to single, all good then I suppose
* rel-me links on my site huh? Confirmed. Cool. I think I can sign in now? Oh yea. Works now.

== This Wiki ==
Haven't looked at the [[Getting Started on WordPress]] page until now. Whoa. That's a lot of stuff &hellip;

<blockquote>
ignore most other content, very dated, we are in the process of trying to split the pages one for theme developers, and one for users

First impression of this page: lots of 'if' and 'should', I'm already lost, lol
 
I'll leave it alone because WIP.

These are fast, first impressions, by no means thorough, conclusive or even fair!
