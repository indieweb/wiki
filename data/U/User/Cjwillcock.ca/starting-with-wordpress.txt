Doing some initial testing: [https://wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca/ wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca] (begin 2018-06-07)

== This Wiki ==
Haven't looked at the [[Getting Started on WordPress]] page until now. Whoa. That's a lot of stuff &hellip;

<blockquote>
ignore most other content, very dated, we are in the process of trying to split the pages one for theme developers, and one for users
<cite>jgmac1106 #wordpress 2018-06-07</cite></blockquote>

First impression of this page: lots of 'if' and 'should', I'm already lost, lol
 
I'll leave it alone because WIP.

= Open Question (research req'd) =
Are Indieweb plugin and IndieWebify.me meant to be complementary experiences, to the extent that the UX flow is considered on both as one onboarding experience? Or are they loosely coupled (different devs, etc)?

= Itches =
* fix the http/https protocol confusion in relmeauth
* fix the ux on indieweb plugin getting started: beginner / advanced streams [https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb/issues/72 GH Issue #72]
* add email to the rel=me links added by indieweb plugin
* mention that the IndieWeb plugin includes an author h-card widget, somewhere on the getting started page [https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb/issues/90 GH Issue #90]
* add optional email to the h-card widget [https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb/issues/101 GH Issue #101]

= Observations =

== Power User / Developer: Run Through IndieWebify.Me using fresh WP install ==
WP Version: 4.9.6

You all are in for a treat. I'm documenting my first time seeing any of this IndieWeb WP Ecosystem.

I only know of micro_etc_ stuffs and etc. etc. Been here a week or so. Let's see how it goes.

=== Set up Web Sign In ===
No changes from vanilla WP install, and I test ... "Something Went Wrong, no rel=me links could be found"
* Can indiewebify.me detect WP as the source and offer specific guidance here, ie: "Have you installed and activated the Indieweb plugin?" smart onboarding for the win

So I start with the primary plugin, Indieweb plugin. How did I know to do this? Found it in the WordPress block far away at the bottom of [[Getting Started on WordPress]].

Search via WP Dash -> Plugins -> Add new -> "IndieWeb" -- huzzah, I recognize the logo, success, installed and activated
* No new custom post types, hmmm. Not what I was expecting, maybe that comes in other plugins (note: very beginner at all things IndieWebCamp)
* New IWC Menu in my sidebar. That Icon is on the blurry side though.

Checking out this new plugin -- wow, a page full of info for me under Getting Started. Alright IWC, alright.
* I guess you want me to fill in my user profile. Look at all those new fields. okay. done.
* Side option multi/single author ---- it's already set to single, all good then I suppose. Doesn't seem so critical as to be #2 step on getting started with the IndieWeb.
* rel-me links on my site huh? Confirmed. Cool. I think I can sign in now? Oh yea. Works now. Or does it?

"We found the following rel=me URLs on your site" -> but they don't link back.
* Where is my email based rel=me?
* What the?! Now it recognizes I am from WP. Because of the plugin I just installed? Hmm.

Alright, let's see, I added twitter and github information. I'll temporarily change those backlinks to my wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca address and try it again.
* Still no joy? Sigh ... oh yea this. When I enter my domain without protocol information at indiewebify.me, it defaults to HTTP. However, the HTTP address auto-redirects to HTTPS on my site. Yes, while this trivia is completely discoverable, alas it is not coming to the party, fine fine. I'm in the habit of entering the domain-with-protocol as https but lately (indieweb influence) I am thinking of cjwillcock.ca as my identity token. However, when I enter domain-without-protocol (wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca) on Github or on my WP dashboard it defaults to http, while the same domain-without-protocol entered on Twitter correctly determines the https!

Recap: set my url as wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca on Github, WordPress, Twitter and IndieWebify.me, result of web-sign in test is github works perfectly, while Twitter doesn't link back.

I don't like it. I'm going to set them all to https. And, now it's all green, github & twitter working perfectly. Maybe? I haven't logged into anything yet. Maybe that will come later.

Next!

=== Check your homepage h-card ===
Alright I will. Survey says &hellip; no h-cards found.
* It seems that my coming from WP is forgotten again. There is no advice specific to making it work with WordPress.
* I followed the green link in the green-background area, and I'm now fully into the microformats wiki. Which is fine, but I'm shifting gears here big time. I went from Maximum Fresh Energy WP Power Install Fresh Spicy Fresh Indie Web to "... h-card is one of several open mf draft standards suitable for embedding data in HTML". Wait a second here. I started at data. It was marked up with HyperText. Now I need a very small format to embed data into it? Haven't I already done that when I put HTML around my content (my data)? I know, I know breath buddy, breath &hellip; I think the word I want there is metadata (data about data). But what am I doing here anyway? Okay back from Mercury, and time to hit the browser's back button.

I'm actually a little lost here at step 2. However, I noticed back in my WP dashboard there was an extensions sub-menu on the IndieWeb Plugin sidebar menu, so I'm going back there to look for clues.

I found an extension called Microformats 2.
* As a second step with indiewebify.me, I would expect the MF2 extension to be the first on on this list. I could see folks not finding it within a few seconds at this point and bailing. A few seconds more and there it is, 8th of 10.

Microformats2, installed and activated. 
* No new settings, or sidebar items in WP Dashboard. No new menu entries under IWC. k.

How are we doing with this h-card situation? Well it still doesn't work, no h-cards found.
* Check the plugin description, uh-oh: "It is only a very basic implementation, because not every element is accessible through actions or filters. It is better to use a theme that supports Microformats 2 fully." Yikes. So &hellip;

<blockquote>
'''Aside'''
''Why are all of the microformats tokens in my class attributes?'' They are data right (or meta-data, whatever). But here's the thing about that, class is entirely for the purpose of styling is it not? Should it not be? Okay, okay. Maybe it's not the case (I am fully aware that it is in-spec usage to use the class attribute for other than styling) but think about this. I don't want microformats in my way when I am working through the cascades of multi-faceted stylesheets operating in tandem in my responsive web design projects that cover a large swathe of my limited capacity to hold details in my mind sufficient to reason and productively express my intention - to adjust the design, not the data in any way whatever! It could easily be in data-* attributes couldn't it? Either data-mu="&hellip;" or <element data-h-card data-x-etc>. You know how hard a battle it is to get junior devs to separate the concerns of data & design right? ''Have you tried getting a senior dev to un-separate them?'' So positive productive power to bear on this- either I will force my mind to change, or I can kick this discussion around when I eventually become competent with the microformats2 specs.
</blockquote>

Okay - I decided I would create a widget to make this h-card I need but ... what's this ... IndieWeb plugin already has such a widget. Hm. Yea, that Getting Started section in the IndieWeb plugin really could have saved me some time here.

K. Widget, on my sidebar, run the test again and ... woo! Success. Sort of? It's saying I should add my email. Hm. It's in my user profile already. I didn't choose, "don't show my email" anywhere. Privacy by default, it's good this way. Now, where is the remove-bandaid button? 
* There could be an option in the widget. "[ ] Reveal my email address."

Well that's fine, I'll just put the recommend html inside the biographical information section. Test it and, NOPE. It shows up in the 'note' and isn't detected at IndieWebify.me. 
* It is right at this point that I can no longer operate directly from WordPress admin with plugins, settings and options (non-coder), and have true success with indiewebify.me. What a shame.

Whatever, I'll just go make a widget for h-card with email reveal option based on the widget from Indieweb plugin.
* Found a bug
* Reported an issue to the repo [https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb/issues/106 GH Issue #106]
* Fixing a bug
* [https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb/pull/107 Pull Request]
* Added my required functionality
TODO
* Pull request for h-card updates
