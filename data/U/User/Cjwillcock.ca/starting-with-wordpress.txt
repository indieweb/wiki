* fix the http/https protocol confusion in relmeauth
* fix the ux on indieweb plugin getting started: beginner / advanced streams
* add email to the rel=me links added by indieweb plugin

== Power User / Developer: Run Through IndieWebify.Me using fresh WP install ==
WP Version: 4.9.6

You guys are in for a treat. I'm documenting my first time seeing any of this IndieWeb WP Ecosystem.

I only know of micro_etc_ stuffs and etc. etc. Been here a week or so. Let's see how it goes.

=== Set up Web Sign In ===
No changes from vanilla WP install, and I test ... "Something Went Wrong, no rel=me links could be found"
* Can indiewebify.me detect WP as the source and offer specific guidance here, smart onboarding for the win

So I start with the primary plugin, Indieweb plugin. How did I know to do this? Found it in the WordPress block far away at the bottom of the Getting Start page.

Search via WP Dash -> Plugins -> Add new -> "IndieWeb" -- huzzah, I recognize the logo, success, installed and activated
* No new custom post types, hmmm. Not what I was expecting, maybe that comes in other plugins (note: very beginner at all things IndieWebCamp)
* New IWC Menu in my sidebar. That Icon is on the blurry side though.
* That plugin description though "Interested in connecting your WordPress site to the IndieWeb?", yes &hellip;

Checking out this new plugin -- wow, a page full of info for me under Getting Started. Alright IWC, alright.
* I guess you want me to fill in my user profile. Look at all those new fields. okay. done.
* Side option multi/single author ---- it's already set to single, all good then I suppose. Doesn't seem so critical as to be #2 step on getting started with the IndieWeb.
* rel-me links on my site huh? Confirmed. Cool. I think I can sign in now? Oh yea. Works now. Or does it?

"We found the following rel=me URLs on your site" -> but they don't link back.
* Where is my email based rel=me?
* What the?! Now it recognizes I am from WP. Because of the plugin I just installed? Hmm.

Alright, let's see, I added twitter and github information. I'll temporarily change those backlinks to my wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca address and try it again.
* Still no joy? Sigh ... oh yea this. When I enter my domain without protocol information at indiewebify.me, it defaults to HTTP. However, the HTTP address auto-redirects to HTTPS on my site. Yes, while this trivia is completely discoverable, alas it is not coming to the party, fine fine. I'm in the habit of entering the domain-with-protocol as https but lately (indieweb influence) I am thinking of cjwillcock.ca as my identity token. However, when I enter domain-without-protocol (wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca) on Github or on my WP dashboard it defaults to http, while the same domain-without-protocol entered on Twitter correctly determines the https!

Recap: set my url as wp-dev.cjwillcock.ca on Github, WordPress, Twitter and IndieWebify.me, result of web-sign in test is github works perfectly, while Twitter doesn't link back.

I don't like it. I'm going to set them all to https. And, now it's all green, github & twitter working perfectly. Maybe? I haven't logged into anything yet. Maybe that will come later.

Next!

=== Check your homepage h-card ===
Alright I will. Survey says &hellip; no h-cards found.
* It seems that my coming from WP is forgotten again. There is no advice specific to making it work with WordPress.
* I'm now fully into the microformats wiki. Which is fine, but I'm shifting gears here big time. I went from Maximum Fresh Energy WP Power Install Fresh Spicy Fresh Indie Web to "... h-card is one of several open mf draft standards suitable for embedding data in HTML". Wait a second here. I started at data. It was marked up with HyperText. Now I need a very small format to embed data into it? Haven't I already done that when I put HTML around my content (my data)? I know, I know breath buddy, breath &hellip; I think the word you maybe need there is metadata (data about data). But what am I doing here anyway? Okay back from Mercury, and time to hit the browser's back button.

I'm actually a little lost here at step 2. However, I noticed back in my WP dashboard there was an extensions sub-menu on the IndieWeb Plugin sidebar menu, so I'm going back there to look for clues.

== This Wiki ==
Haven't looked at the [[Getting Started on WordPress]] page until now. Whoa. That's a lot of stuff &hellip;

<blockquote>
ignore most other content, very dated, we are in the process of trying to split the pages one for theme developers, and one for users

First impression of this page: lots of 'if' and 'should', I'm already lost, lol
 
I'll leave it alone because WIP.

These are fast, first impressions, by no means thorough, conclusive or even fair!
