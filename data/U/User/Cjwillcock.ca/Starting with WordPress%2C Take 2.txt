== Strategy ==
In this setup journal, I will follow the progress stages set out by [[IndieMark]] levels. I'll try to collect together a process and a short-list of helpful testing tools. My desired outcome is:
# setup my vanilla, self-hosted WordPress install
# demonstrate where a healthy level of confidence comes from: that the setup is /correctly/ (or correctly-enough) doing what needs doing to jump in
