== Strategy ==
In this setup journal, I will follow the progress stages set out by [[IndieMark]] levels, while setting up a WordPress website. I'll try to collect together a process and a short-list of helpful testing tools.

== Starting with WordPress ==
=== Domain / Web-hosting Setup ===
I have a personal domain. It is [https://cjwillcock.ca/ cjwillcock.ca]. I'm not covering the setup details, but jumping ahead to where my WordPress install is done, and I have logged in for the first time.

=== Theme Selection ===
For this setup, I have selected the [https://github.com/dshanske/twentysixteen-indieweb twentysixteen-indieweb] WordPress theme by {{gwg}}. While other themes are available, I have seen some people having success using this theme and I want to give myself the best chance of success here. I manually installed the theme by uploading it to my hosting account (git clone via ssh if you really want to know).

=== Plugins ===
First I'll install the IndieWeb plugin. I use the WP admin dashboard and search for 'indieweb'. There's the plugin, so I install and activate it (v3.3.8). It adds a new menu to my WP dashboard sidebar. There's the logo I recognize from the wiki, down near the end of the list. The getting started item inside that menu has some good info about what I need to do to get started.
# Fill out my profile information on my user page
# Go into Appearance -> Widgets, and put the Author H-Card widget on my sidebar

=== Login to the IndieWeb Wiki ===
The WP install on my site is now enough that I can log-in to the IndieWeb community wiki. The wiki does need one more piece to do this (amazing!) proof of identity and let me in. For some or all of the social network usernames/I.D.s I set out in my user page on my WP Dashboard (ie: github), I go to those social sites and make sure my website address matches the address that I put for my website on my user profile on my own site (and this should match the domain name where I installed WordPress). 
* Take special care here: when the website is on https, put the https:// piece in the website name option everywhere.

Now, I visit indieweb.org and look to the top right of the page for the login link. I enter my domain name here and press sign in (taking care about the https bit). It sees GitHub & Twitter in my case, so I use GitHub. I do my usual sign-in with GitHub and now I'm at the indieweb.org wiki, signed in as me (my domain).

=== Wikify ===
I click on my name/domain near the top-right of any wiki page, and I'm at my very own user page. I wanted to join the IndieWeb community, so here I am! I'll put a link to my WordPress site and save it, then take a look at [[wikifying#Make_your_user_page]] to learn about what else I can do here on the wiki.

=== Write a Blog Post ===
What's it like so far? I think I'll tell someone. It's time to write a blog post on my WordPress blog. I take all the time I need, because this is the bit I want to make a hobby of going forward.

=== On Your IndieMarks, Get Set, Go! ===
There's a fun way to track my progress with setting myself up on the IndieWeb called [[IndieMark]]. According to this, I should be all set to claim my Level 1. All right! Just to be sure, I'll use part of the [https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/ IndieWebify.me] site know I'm in good shape. I pop in the permanent link ([https://cjwillcock.ca/2018/06/08/a-little-adventure-begins-here/ https://cjwillcock.ca/2018/06/08/a-little-adventure-begins-here/]) to the post I wrote when I first got started. It looks pretty good. Not everything is giving me a green/success down near the bottom here. IndieWebify.me doesn't follow the levels of Indiemark so it's got some stuff that comes a little bit later. Nothing to worry about for right now!

=== One is the Loneliest Number ===
I've got my very own website! I wrote my first blog post! That's right, I'm '''P'''osting to my '''O'''wn '''S'''ite! None of my friends and family know about it &hellip; It's time to '''S'''yndicate '''E'''lsewhere.

=== POSSE ===
When I post to my blog, I'm not looking to squirrel my writing away privately, I'm looking to share. To reach everyone I know, while still posting to my own site, I can have my WordPress site help me to [[POSSE]] my content automatically. It's not going to be perfect, but any amount that can happen automatically is a part of this which I won't need to do myself! 

I'll use the [[Bridgy]] service to do all hard work of getting my content into the big silos like Twitter, and I'll use the [[Wordpress Webmention Plugin]] on my site to let Bridgy know whenever I post something new.

=== Now That You Mention It ===
I head to my WordPress dashboard, look for the IndieWeb menu there on the sidebar and choose the extensions option. There is the [[Wordpress Webmention Plugin]] by {{pfefferle}} which I want. I install and activate it, then find a new Webmentions option inside the IndieWeb menu on my dashboard sidebar. It takes me to the settings page for the plugin. Perfect.

There's a clear message near the top of the settings page that things may look a little rough without the support of another plugin, [[Semantic Linkbacks]], by the same author. Makes sense to me! These default options look fine to get started so I'll do the recommended plugin too. 

I find the semantic linkbacks plugin in the same place as the webmentions was (IndieWeb -> Extensions). I install and activate it as well, with no extra settings page required.
