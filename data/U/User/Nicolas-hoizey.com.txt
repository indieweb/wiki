=== silo posting ===

Silos I'm using without a copy destination:
* [[GitHub]] - I use GitHub for both some of my own open source projects, and to contribute to others.

__TOC__


== skills ==
I am comfortable with the following indieweb [[creator]] skills:
* coding (HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, responsive images, performance)
* Web architecture (networks, HTTP)

== figured out ==
Things I feel like I've figured out pretty well, have shipped on my own site, can depend on, and am available to help explain to others.
* [[POSSE]]
* [[Webmention]],
** which I now use instead of Disqus, as explained in my “[https://nicolas-hoizey.com/2017/07/so-long-disqus-hello-webmentions.html So long Disqus, hello Webmention]” article
