'''<dfn>Robijntje</dfn>''' is a 15-year old starting IndieWeb user living in the Netherlands.

I built a little blogging thingie that I called [[neopub]] for my website.


* https://geheimesite.nl
* http://micro.geheimesite.nl

== Projects ==
* '''[[neopub]]''': a simple blogging thingie I built for my own [https://micro.geheimesite.nl microblog]. It has a [[micropub]] endpoint, sends [[webmentions]] and supports multiple post types (including [[notes]], [[likes]], [[bookmarks]] and [[reposts]])

== Itches ==
* Add a media endpoint
* Add the ability to delete/update posts to my micropub endpoint
* Figure out why posting to [[indieweb.xyz]] sometimes doesn't work.
