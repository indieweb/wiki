Hi! I'm '''<dfn>{{robijntje}}</dfn>''', a 17-year old IndieWeb developer living in the Netherlands.

My online handle used to be '''Robijntje''', but I changed it to '''axcelott''' (from axolotl) or '''obliviously''' (or derivatives) almost everywhere.

== Projects ==
* '''[[neopub]]''': a simple blogging platform that I built for my own [https://micro.geheimesite.nl microblog]. It has a [[micropub]] endpoint, sends [[webmentions]] and supports multiple post types (including [[notes]], [[likes]], [[bookmarks]], [[photos]] and [[reposts]])

* '''untitled''': a yet-to-be-named project that explores ways to blend websites, [[social media]] and collaboration on the Web, by implementing an easy-to-use website engine powered by various open standards. 

See my [https://geheimesite.nl personal website] for my other (not-indieweb related) projects.

== Itches ==
