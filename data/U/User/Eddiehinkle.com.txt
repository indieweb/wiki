= Blogging Process =
All my posts start out as a sheet in my Ulysses app with a sentence thought. So if I have several ideas for blog posts, it's several sheets in Ulysses that I order based on priority. Then when I get a chance, I sit down and turn the sentence into a full post and post it. Currently, that means copying the text from Ulysses and pasting it into a Micropub app, likely [[micro.blog]]'s iOS app to post to my website.

<div class="e-content p-summary">Here's a look at how my website complies with IndieWeb standards and what my plans and ideas are for the future of my site and for the IndieWeb.<p></p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>abode is my IndieWeb personal website software built with TypeScript Node.js. It is in on this website since February 2017.</li>
<li><a href="https://indigenous.abode.pub/ios/">Indigenous</a> - A iOS <a href="https://indieweb.org/micropub">Micropub</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/microsub">Microsub</a> client.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-on">Working On</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finishing freeing my website from Jekyll static site pages.</li>
<li>Import historical webmentions locally into the post storage directory. </li>
<li>Save new webmentions into post storage directory.</li>
<li>Set up <a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/2018/11/03/17/article/">display of webmention responses</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="currently-on-my-mind">Currently on my mind</h3>
<ul>
<li>convert nickname cache to work over Micropub and store as h-cards.</li>
<li>Think through h-card collections as people groups.</li>
<li>add audience to posts</li>
<li>Get Fed.Brid.gy set up for Mastodon federation.</li>
<li>Save individual post images into the post storage directory.</li>
<li>Set outgoing webmentions to be delayed and staggered after an event hook, not immediately after save.</li>
<li>Add subscribe page similar to aaronpk, but add support for newsletter as well.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="itches">Itches</h3>
<ul>

<li>Lifestream Micropub Syncing app. An iOS app that syncs the Healthkit data that you choose up to your micropub endpoint.</li>
<li>What would a modern web browser look/feel like? How do you navigate? How would it integrate with microformats, micropub, etc?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation-design">Implementation Design</h2>
<p><em>This section is outdated and needs to be updated_</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This site is a standard jekyll site.<ul>
<li>Currently my site contains the following post types: article, book review, photo, video and RSVPs.</li>
<li>I have two types of Jekyll collections: note and media.</li>
<li>Note is the general all purpose collection type. Using different attributes based on <a href="https://indieweb.org/post-type-discovery">post type discovery</a>, Jekyll uses different template includes to emulate different post types.</li>
<li>The media collection is for the read/watch/listen post types. I created this as a different collection type because it's an area that I plan to do a lot of experimenting in and don't want to lock myself into anything or mess up my other post types while experimenting. I no longer use posts within Jekyll.<ul>
<li>video is currently just a link to YouTube. #IndieWebFail. That needs to be fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>node.js scripts run in the background to PESOS Goodreads content to my /data directory and periodically rebuilds my Jekyll site with fresh data.</li>
<li>The goal is to always have a static site as much as possible, with node.js micro services that update my static files as need be. Eventually, if needed, having node.js store data in a database and then whenever data is updated, re-publish static files. I would like to stick with jekyll as long as possible, but if that ever gets to the point that it is too complicated, the goal is to build a node.js module that exports HTML through a template language like Jade.</li>
