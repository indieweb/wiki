Heya! in late 2022 (?) I started I joined the fediverse and fell in love with blogging and a later discovered the indieweb, so here I am!

My [https://yusuf.fyi website] is made with Astro and hosted on vercel. Vercel being a serverless platform and astro being a static site generator (for the most part) have introduced some challenges when it comes to implementing [[Webmention|webmentions]] and other indieweb staples, but that's the fun part, isn't it?
