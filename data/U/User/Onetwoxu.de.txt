I'm some average boring german dude who likes coffee and punk rock a lot.<br>
In real life, friends call me Groschi.<br>
I'm also the moron responsible for a bilingual music blog called 12XU.<br>
I'm always interested in clever ways to POSSE and Backfeed between my blog and the fediverse.

'''Things that currently work for me:'''<br>
POSSE from my Blog to Activitypub (Mastodon & Pleroma, currently) via RSS & feed2toot[https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot].<br>
Backfeed from Activitypub via Bridgy[https://brid.gy].

'''Things that i haven't found a decent solution for yet:'''<br>
POSSE and Backfeed to/from Diaspora.<br>
Bridging Diaspora & Activitypub (ideally they should be interoperable by default, but it doesn't look like that might happen in the forseeable future. "Creative differences", ya know?)
