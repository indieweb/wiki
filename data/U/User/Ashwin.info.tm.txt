== IndieWeb implementation ==

* On 2019-11-18 I made a [https://github.com/ashwinvis/ashwinvis.github.io/commit/5eea50c82275cd0308e7fa0d05286825095a1b6b commit] to use a  [https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain subdomain] instead of the original github.io URL.
* On 2019-12-04 started a [https://github.com/ashwinvis/ashwinvis.github.io/pull/13 pull-request] to get the static website talking using [[indieauth]], [[micropub]] and [[webmentions]]

== What works so far ==

* [[indieauth]] and [[rel-me]] setup with GPG and GitHub authentication
* [[microformats2]] with [[h-card]], [[h-entry]] implemented by modifying the [[Pelican]] index page, HTML header and article template.
* [https://ashwin-micropub.herokuapp.com/ Micropub endpoint] with [[IndieKit]] hosted at [[Heroku]].
* [[webmentions]] with [https://webmentions.io webmentions.io]
** [[backfeed]] responses from [[Mastodon]] using [https://brid.gy Brid.gy] into [[webmentions]]

== What I would like to do ==
* [[micropub]] configuration with [[IndieKit]].
* [[POSSE]]
* [[backfeed]] till [[Pelican]]
* Use one of the [[Micropub/Clients]]
