Hi! I'm Ari. I mainly do things on my own website [https://ariscript.org ariscript.org]. For now, I plan to write about whatever is on my mind, mostly things about technology, education in computer science, politics, and the general state of the Web.

My website is (currently) built using [[11ty]] and hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

=== Indieweb Involvement ===

My website automatically generates [[Atom]] and [[JSON Feed|JSON]] feeds, and the HTML is marked up using [[microformats2]]. My website is naturally going to be indie because of my general opposition to capitalism and the attention economy on the Internet that it has created. My website also obeys [[CSS_Naked_Day|CSS Naked Day]].

The infrastructure that powers my website is [https://github.com/ariscript/www open source] and licensed under the AGPL in the hopes that it would help more people get started with their own websites. I have helped some of my friends start their own websites as well.
