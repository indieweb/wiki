= Hans Gerwitz =

I'm an old geek who has long been a curmudgeon about the control big brands have over my identity.

I have called St. Louis (Missouri), Seattle, and Amsterdam home.

== .project ==

I experiment at [https://hans.gerwitz.com/site/ hans.gerwitz.com], which I envision becoming a canonical store of my "cultural products" and other data.

I try to be a good web citizen with the projects published by [https://theartificial.com/ my design agency].

== Itches ==

=== Categorizing ===

I don't care to "publish a blog" but professional concerns mean I need to have some consistency in what I share in any given venue. Today, that means I post "work" articles to the company blog (and PESOS, and sometimes syndicate to Medium), "personal" articles to Svbtle (and PESOS), and only purely-personal content directly to my own site. POSSE would be cleaner, but the setup and maintenance cost is too high for how little writing I do.

=== Personal Data ===

There's a lot of data that I don't mind sharing (being a not-very-vulnerable White American Male) like location, media consumption, health data. This lives in silos and I want to aggregate it. Zenobase is a start at what I imagine, but I think I will someday finish a home-brew project for this. (originally inspired by [http://www.busterbenson.com Buster Benson])

=== Future Proofing ===

I can't help but fantasize that some future historian will find my life useful to consider. I definitely am a lazy geek who want to avoid spending too much time reacting to dependency updates, security vulnerabilities, or technology fashion.

So I prefer old, boring stacks. Static HTML content websites, Ruby server-side code, basic JQuery on the frontend when bling must be added.

=== Content vs Community ===

Although I feel strongly about "indie" content control, the conversational elements of silos like comments and throwaway @replies don't seem worth preserving, to me. So my enthusiasm is strong for most of the IndieWeb brand, when discussion turns toward chasing every silo feature down to reactions, I quickly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
