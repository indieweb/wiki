== Intro ==
Hi! I'm John. I work for a large software company located the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I've spent a couple of decades designing, building, and deploying large systems on a wide variety of platforms. I've also spent a fair bit of time as an editor and writer for a couple of industry journals and led or helped develop web and industry standards such as [https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/ XML], [https://docs.oasis-open.org/wsbpel/2.0/OS/wsbpel-v2.0-OS.html Business Process Execution Language (BPEL)], [http://xml.coverpages.org/OASIS-Regrep-rsV101.pdf ebXML], and many others.  I've been experimenting with various IndieWeb standards over the past few years and am very interested in getting more involved in the development and maintenance of them.

== Websites ==
My neglected blog is limping along on an outdated version of [[Known]] at [https://evdemon.org evdemon.org]. I hope to get this mess cleaned up soon.

== Working On ==
* Cleaning up my blog, {{strikethrough|upgrading to latest version of [[Known]]}}
* Learning more about IndieWeb
* Hacking and frequently breaking a version of [https://github.com/daveajones/cartulary/blob/master/README.md Cartulary] to add better support for IndieWeb. This will be my new blog if can ever get it working the way I like.

== Itches ==
=== Known ===
* Fix my messy, outdated installation by upgrading to the latest version.
* Add proper home and about pages
* Add structure to my blog so that entries are better formatted. I <i>really</i> like [http://davewiner.com/ Dave Winer's] [http://scripting.com posting style] and would love to develop a template or plugin to easily use this style with [[Known]].
* Contribute to installation and hosting documentation, making it easier for new users to adopt and use the platform.

=== Cartulary ===
* [https://github.com/daveajones Dave Jones] has [https://github.com/daveajones/cartulary/blob/master/README.md built a very interesting "digital archiver"] that I would love to get integrated with my site and modify it to support IndieWeb standards.

=== Radio ===
* I'm currently using Dave Winer's excellent [http://radio3.smallpict.com/2014/09/01/gettingStartedWithRadio3.html Radio3] as a [http://radio3.io/users/jevdemon/ LinkBlog]. I'd like to get it better integrated into my blog.

=== Indieweb ===
* Hoping to get more involved with developing or evolving IndieWeb standards.
