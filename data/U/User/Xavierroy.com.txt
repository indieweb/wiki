I own:

* [http://xavierroy.com XavierRoy.com] - My main website
* [http://xavierroy.in XavierRoy.in] - A landing page

=== XavierRoy.com Notes ===
* Currently using Wordpress, was using Known earlier.

==== Indieweb usage ====

* using Post Kinds plugin
** read - [PESOS from Goodreads] using a Zapier workflow that creates a post when I add a book to my #nowreading list on Goodreads. I then use Post Kinds to add more info and publish the post when I complete the book and syndicate manually to Goodreads.
** photo - [PESOS from Instagram] imported from Instagram using Keyring Social Importer plugin
** watch - [PESOS from Letterboxd] imported from Letterboxd using IFTTT to create a draft post

Sometimes I use multiple kinds for a post like a photo of a food at a restaurant that gets the eat, photo, and checkin treatment.

== Undocumented Indieweb Usage ==
* Support for [[audience]] using a modified version of the Keyring People and Places plugin. Examples: [https://xavierroy.com/audience/bibliophiles/ Bibliophiles]
* I [[person-tag|tag]] people and places in posts using the Keyring People and Places plugin. Right now, they can be accessed from a private page.
