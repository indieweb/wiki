I own:

* [http://xavierroy.com XavierRoy.com] - My main website
* [http://xavierroy.in XavierRoy.in] - A landing page

=== XavierRoy.com Notes ===
* Currently using Wordpress, was using Known earlier.

==== Indieweb usage ====

* using Post Kinds plugin
** read - [PESOS from Goodreads] using a Zapier workflow that creates a post when I add a book to my #nowreading list on Goodreads. I then use Post Kinds to add more info and publish the post when I complete the book and syndicate manually to Goodreads.
** photo - [PESOS from Instagram] imported from Instagram using Keyring Social Importer plugin
** watch - [PESPS from Letterboxd] imported from Letterboxd using IFTTT to create a draft post

Sometimes I use multiple kinds for a post like a photo of a food at a restaurant that gets the eat, photo, and checkin treatment.

* Having issues with Micropub plugin
** issue with authorization headers.. really cannot figure out why. see [https://github.com/snarfed/wordpress-micropub/issues/80 Error: undefined indexes #80]
