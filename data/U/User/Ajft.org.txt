Personal page of me, ''ajft'', from [http://ajft.org]

Trying to infuse my org-mode / hugo website [http://ajft.org] with the indieweb spirit, in my copious spare time.  Currently built using org-mode in emacs, published to markdown, then the markdown read by hugo, using [[User:Www.amitgawande.com|amit]]'s [https://github.com/am1t/ghostwriter|ghostwriter] theme.
