* Set up [[Webmention]] support for comments via [[Bridgy]], tying together multiple platforms. Thinking [[Bluesky]] to start with, but I'm open to other ideas
* Hardcode legacy Disqus comments as I move away towards Webmentions.
* Set up reply by email.
* Automate [[POSSE]] publishing to Medium, and maybe find other places to share what I write (like [[Bluesky]]).
* Get myself added to the Indieweb [[webring]].
* Submit a post to [[IndieNews]]
