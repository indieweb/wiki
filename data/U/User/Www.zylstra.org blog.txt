Into Networked Agency, which requires not just the web but also other technologies and methods to have much lower thresholds and be outside of silos, so that my neighbours can use it easily, and as a group find agency through it.

online daily since 1989, blogging since 2002 at https://zylstra.org/blog (had a personal site before that for some years, which webarchive traces back to early 1998) 

I co-organised [https://indieweb.org/2019/Utrecht IndieWebCamp Utrecht 2019] with {{frank}}, and attended [https://indieweb.org/2018/Nuremberg Indie Web Camp Nuremberg 2018].
