My primary home on the web is [https://www.zinzy.website zinzy.website], which is where I store a variety of [[https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts Indieweb posts]]. I've been working with [[Jekyll]] for six years, but I'm thinking of transitioning to a platform that's a little more Indieweb-friendly.

== Currently tinkering with ==
