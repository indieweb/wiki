== Introduction ==
My name is Zinzy Waleson, and I've been publishing things on the web, in a variety of formats and under a variety of names, since 2002. By day, I manage design and product at a Dutch start-up in educational technology. In the evening, I like to tinker with technologies, and maintain a digital garden that helps me write in a way that is less performative.

== Now ==

* I'm fairly comfortable with my website's current interactive setup, so I'm moving into cleaning up the code and making it depend on Javascript less
* I attended and very much enjoyed [[2022/Düsseldorf|IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2022]]. It was good to see how curious, patient, and kind all attendees were.
* I'm playing around with building my own [[static site generator]], currently using a simple [https://github.com/zinzy/zinzy.website/blob/master/app.py link Python script]. It's a nice way to learn more about [[Python]].

== My IndieWeb setup ==
https://www.zinzy.website is my home on the website.

=== The stack ===
I maintain a folder of Markdown notes, some public and many private, the public ones of which are compiled to HTML by a simple script. 

=== To do ===
I used to maintain a to do list in this section, but I've moved it to the Itches section of my [https://www.zinzy.website home page].
