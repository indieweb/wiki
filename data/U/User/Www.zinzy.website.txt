== Introduction ==
My name is Zinzy Waleson, and I've been publishing things on the web, in a variety of formats and under a variety of names, since 2002. By day, I manage design and product at a Dutch start-up in educational technology. In the evening, I like to tinker with technologies, and maintain a digital garden that helps me write in a way that is less performative.

== Now ==

* I'm fairly comfortable with my website's current interactive setup, so I'm moving into cleaning up the code and making it depend on Javascript less
* I attended [[2022/Düsseldorf|IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2022]] and offered to be the accountability buddy of a new community member. If you're that person, feel free to reach out to me.

== My IndieWeb setup ==
https://www.zinzy.website is my home on the website.

=== The stack ===
* [Gatsby]
* MDX
* React Icons
* Bootstrap

=== To do ===
* '''Turn posts into proper Indieweb post types with feed''': while I'm making an effort to create Indieweb posts, they could be better organized, and I should probably add a feed of some kind
* '''Remove components that require Javascript''': If I can verify that https://codepen.io/rafaelsnts/pen/BEzZoX is cross-browser compatible, I'll use it
