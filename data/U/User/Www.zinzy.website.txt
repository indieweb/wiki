== Introduction ==
My name is Zinzy Waleson Geene, and I've been publishing things on the web, in a variety of formats and under a variety of names, since 1997. I'm a hobby programmer, a bad one at that, who likes to tinker with technologies. I earn a living as a senior-but-silly product researcher and designer.
