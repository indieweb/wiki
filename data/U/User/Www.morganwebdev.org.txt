Morgan Murrah was a former user of the IndieWeb Wiki, until he lost interest in it.

More than just losing interest, Morgan specifically records of his memory of being very distraught after as a series of difficult work at his job and chronic illness, and then attempting to make humor or light of a technical topic called "SEO" and then being treated like I was a "religious proselytizer" which seemed weird and a cult of personality on the part of the organizers, who seemed unable to empathize that some people have to live and work around some stuff thats not fun. Sometimes people just want to be understood and heard I guess. My intention was to vent about work in the random channel, I just feel I was misunderstood.

Deciding that in retrospect it was foolish to put any empathy in a online community basically built upon taking moral highgrounds, Morgan is very happy to know many people through this community but won't be a reliable volunteer.

== Websites that matter to Morgan ==

https://whatcompublichospital.org/ - This is a website that actually is impacting my community, and is a personally run website made with some tips from HWC's and events. Im grateful for these. But ultimately this website is much more important than some personal blog.

This website I attempted to talk about in the context of "SEO" was mentioned in a newspaper - https://www.cascadiadaily.com/2025/aug/04/you-might-live-in-a-public-hospital-district-what-does-that-mean/ - and actually impacting my community.
