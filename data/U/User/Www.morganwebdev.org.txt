Morgan Murrah was a former user of the IndieWeb Wiki, until he lost interest in it.

More than just losing interest, Morgan specifically records of his memory of being very distraught after as a series of difficult work at his job and chronic illness, and then attempting to make humor or light of a technical topic called "SEO". My intention was to vent about work in the random channel, I just feel I was misunderstood, I was looking for comradery.

Morgan is very happy to know many people through this community but won't be a reliable volunteer.

== Stance on needing to work for health insurance - Not a universally shared or understood experience ==

Some of us in the USA have to work for health insurance, and have chronic health conditions that lead us to finding work that we can manage the best we can. Sometimes we have to entertain ideas in a corporate world that we wish to escape in a more human focused world. But it doesn't help to be a high and mighty and moralize about everything. In this way, I came to need to explain to people that don't understand not everyone has the same choices. 

This leads me to my next heading:

== Websites that matter to Morgan ==

https://whatcompublichospital.org/ - This is a website that actually is impacting my community, and is a personally run website made with some tips from HWC's and events. Im grateful for these. But ultimately this website is much more important than some personal blog.

This website I attempted to talk about in the context of "SEO" was mentioned in a newspaper - https://www.cascadiadaily.com/2025/aug/04/you-might-live-in-a-public-hospital-district-what-does-that-mean/ - and actually impacting my community.
