Morgan Murrah was a former user of the IndieWeb Wiki, until he lost interest in it.

More than just losing interest, Morgan specifically records of his memory of being very distraught after as a series of difficult work at his job and chronic illness, and then attempting to make humor or light of a technical topic called "SEO" and then being treated like I was a "religious proselytizer" which seemed weird and a cult of personality.
