Morgan Murrah was a former user of the IndieWeb Wiki, until he lost interest.

Morgan is very happy to know many people through this community but won't be a reliable volunteer or online as much for a long while.

== Websites that matter to Morgan ==

https://whatcompublichospital.org/ - This is a website that actually is impacting my community, and is a personally run website made with some tips from HWC's and events. Im grateful for these. But ultimately this website is much more important than some personal blog.

This website I attempted to talk about in the context of "SEO" was mentioned in a newspaper - https://www.cascadiadaily.com/2025/aug/04/you-might-live-in-a-public-hospital-district-what-does-that-mean/ - and actually impacting my community.

Note. the Website was specifically 'hand made', it is emphasized that no generative program was used to create this website, unless you could the program `npx` and a boilerplate template program.

I thank the HWC's I went to for teaching me about various things I applied in this website and especially the choice of email provider, which has had a dramatic effect in my community. 

I am grateful for all that but moving along, trying to be a little less online going into the new year.
