Hello! My name is [https://anthonynelzinsantos.com/ Anthony Nelzin-Santos]. I was born in France before the world wide web was invented, but i grew up surrounded by computers. I launched my first website in 2000, developed my first web application in 2002, started my first blog in 2004, recorded my first podcast in 2005, uploaded my first video in 2006 and earned my first salary as a web journalist in 2007. Fast forward to 2025 and i’m now writing in English on [https://z1nz0l1n.com/ ''Z1NZ0L1N''].
