== Introduction ==
I'm Negate This, just a simple person doing simple things. Being vegan. Procrastinating. Trying to read more philosophy and literature.

My website is a place for me to put my thoughts. I've built it using a custom static site generator made in [https://clojure.org Clojure], my programming language of choice.

Don't expect anything incredibly unique, as I am no creative.
