I'm a UX Designer striving to create meaningful digital experiences. A strong focus on research-based design helps me creating interactions that are accessible, usable and sustainable. I started my career as a designer and developer focussing on usability, accessibility and information architecture. 

For nine years, I lived in the UK, where I co-founded the web agency UI Farm and worked for clients spanning several industries, such as finance, retail and energy.
