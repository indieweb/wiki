== Introduction ==
My name is Jeff Noh and I've been creating web and mobile products since 2004. My main interest has been around connecting people to each other in new and interesting ways. So, it should come at no surprise that the indieweb has drawn my fascination. I look forward to homebrewing my [https://jnoh.net homepage] and learning from you all.
