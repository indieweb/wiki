Hi, I'm Nik of [https://www.nik.codes Nik Dot Codes] and a newbie in the world of website ownership/blogging/the IndieWeb movement.

I first encountered the IndieWeb late 2019, through some kind of wander through the internet starting at [https://www.privacytools.io Privacytools.io], but unsure of the path to here. But have always been  a huge advocate for breaking away from the current web paradigm; promoting decentralising and federation, Free & Open Source technology and protecting privacy and digital rights. The IndieWeb movement is right up my alley.

== Itches ==

* Properly implementing microformats2 in the site
* Working through the [[ IndieMark ]] checklist

== Working On ==

* Getting the website off of the ground and establishing a routine
* Reading up and figuring out how to involve myself more in the IndieWeb movement
