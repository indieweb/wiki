== About ==
Hi, I'm Alex. I'm based in Malaysia and previously lived in China, U.S.A, Taiwan, and Japan. Previously I worked in big tech as a Software Engineer but I've since been doing my own things. 

== My Blog ==
I started [https://alexhsu.com/en my blog] in 2025 after finally overcoming decades of procrastination. I primarily write in Chinese (Traditional) which is what Taiwanese use. I have an English version too (translated using Claude AI with minimal editing by me) in case my heroes pass by. It also comes in handy when I want to participate in IndieWeb Carnival! 

== What I'm working on ==
I wrote a [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1208009110 Japanese learning app] that has over 1 million downloads and I'm currently working on [https://alexhsu.com/en/game-mindset my first book] about applying video game mental models to overcome procrastination.
