Hi, I'm Alex. I'm based in Malaysia and I primarily write my blog in Chinese (Traditional) but I have an English version too (translated using Claude AI with minimal editing by me). 

I wrote a [http://Japanese%20learning%20app https://apps.apple.com/app/id1208009110] that has over 1 million downloads and I'm currently working on my book about applying video game mental models to creative work.
