Hello! I am a '''bioinformatician''' currently working in the field of '''Genome Architecture'''. Originally from a small town near Verona (Northern Italy), I am currently based in '''Stockholm, Sweden'''.

Here I post about anything, from sketches to code, from pictures to recipes.
Also, the landing page functions as my digital business card.
