<span class="h-card">[https://mark.beech.org.uk Mark Beech]</span> is a full-time student, part-time teacher, sometime unemployed career politician and one time professional WordPress mangler.

=== Own Site ===
My own site is hosted with nearlyfreespeech.net mainly runs [[known]], but I've not yet got around to mangling it yet.

The site also contains many static pages of hand written HTML (well shtml), that are not currently linked to from the homepage. I should probably look at fixing that. 

The site also runs [[baikal]] to sync contacts between my phones. I could use it for a calender as well but I tend to keep that on a paper filofax.
=== Silos ===
Currently I POSSE (almost) all my [[Twitter|Tweets]] and some of my [[Foursquare| Foursquare Checkins]]. 
 
Other silos I use frequently (and would like to in time move to my own site) include [[Reddit]], [[Untappd]], and [[Strava]].
