== Introduction ==
__NOTOC__

Hi, my name is '''Mark'''. I'm a backend Software Engineer in the United Kingdom.

As of the time of writing (2018-06-03), my website (https://markdain.net) is live and supports basic IndieWeb features like h-feed, h-entry, and WebMentions (accept-only, no processing is done yet).

I only speak English (<code>en-US</code>) but in a former life, I spoke a decent amount of Lojban (<code>jbo</code>). It's all faded now except for very basic Lojban.

I frequent IRC as '''ancarda''' and will respond to DMs. I try to attend the Virtual Homebrew Website Club (https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#Virtual_HWC_European_time) as often as time allows. Unfortunately I commute several hours a day, and time is very limited for me.

My website is fully opensource at https://github.com/ancarda/website/
