== Introduction ==
__NOTOC__

Hi, my name is '''Mark'''. I'm a web developer in the United Kingdom.

As of the time of writing (2018-06-03), my website (https://markdain.net) is live and supports basic IndieWeb features like h-feed, h-entry, and WebMentions (accept-only, no processing is done yet).

I only speak English (<code>en-US</code>) but in a former life, I spoke a decent amount of Lojban (<code>jbo</code>). It's all faded now except for very basic Lojban.

I frequent IRC as '''ancarda''' and will respond to DMs. Unless there's a meetup on the weekends, you won't be able to meet me in person as right now my situation has me commuting 5 hours a day, so time is very limited. I do attend the virtual meetups on Mumble though, but I'm muted as nobody wants to hear the noise of trains and buses.

My website is fully opensource at https://github.com/ancarda/website/

== Working On ==

# Improved WebMention support for the website.
