== Introduction ==
__NOTOC__

Hi, my name is '''Mark'''. I'm a web developer in the United Kingdom.

As of the time of writing (2017-11-16), my website (https://markdain.net) is still under construction and should be live very soon.

I only speak English (<code>en-US</code>) but in a former life, I spoke a decent amount of Lojban (<code>jbo</code>). It's all faded now except for very basic Lojban.

I frequent IRC as '''ancarda''' and will respond to DMs. Unless there's a meetup on the weekends, you won't be able to meet me in person as right now my situation has me commuting 5 hours a day, so time is very limited. I do attend the virtual meetups on Mumble though, but I'm muted as nobody wants to hear the noise of trains and buses.

== Working On ==

# Blog software that will let me write entries with h-entry classes.
# Improving the blog software to support images and other rich content in it's WYSIWYG editor.
# WebMention support for the website.
