Hi my name is Stacey DePolo, and I am fired up to be part of the IndieWeb movement. Sometimes I co-host IndieWeb SF at the GoDaddy office near Union Square. 

I'm working on getting GoDaddy's WordPress theme to be indieWebified, and enticing colleagues at the company to host an IndieWeb Camp in either Tuscon or Phoenix. Hit me up if you want to help.
