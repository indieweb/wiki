Hi there.

'''I'm Seb!'''

I work at the intersection of data strategy, AI enablement, and organizational systems thinking. Currently building sustainable approaches to AI adoption while exploring how we can use technology to create more thoughtful, connected communities.

'''What I’m Working On'''

Building cognitivearchitecture.ca My digital garden + space for building, exploring, and thinking about knowledge, work, philosophy, systems building, and being a human - in the shadow of the AI era. I believe that we need to uncover and construct ways to preserve human wisdom, community, culture, and knowledge that are amplified by AI; not replaced by it.

'''AI Partnership & Integration'''

 - Developing frameworks for responsible AI adoption in organizational contexts
 - Building reusable prompt patterns and workflow systems
 - Exploring tools for knowledge work enhancement

'''Data Strategy & Culture'''

 - Designing data literacy programs and organizational capabilities
 - Creating accessible analytics tools and decision-making frameworks
 - Bridging technical implementation with strategic business outcomes

'''Knowledge Systems & Personal Tooling'''

 - Building personal knowledge management systems with Obsidian as my  - primary thinking environment
 - Experimenting with Maps of Content, digital gardening, and “learning in public” approaches
 - Developing sustainable workflows for research, writing, and knowledge synthesis
 - Exploring federated knowledge systems and community-confirmed learning

'''Research & Writing'''

 - Long-range decision-making frameworks and their applications
 - The intersection of sobriety, mental health, and professional growth
 - Parenting with intention in a complex world
 - How ancient wisdom traditions inform modern technological choices
 - Responsible technology adoption and human-AI collaboration

'''Recent Explorations'''

 - Knowledge Systems Design: Creating comprehensive frameworks for personal and organizational learning
 - Relational Reason Design: How we can structure systems of knowledge
to honour complexity, divergent perspectives, tension, and ambiguity.
 - Cross-Disciplinary Integration: Applying insights from disparate fields to technical project management and decision-making
 - Organizational Cognition: How groups think, learn, and make decisions in complex environments
 - Sustainable Change Leadership: Moving beyond quick fixes to create lasting systemic improvements

'''How I Think About Technology'''

I believe technology should amplify human capacity for wisdom, connection, and flourishing. My approach emphasizes:

 - Systems thinking over isolated solutions
 - Ethical reflection alongside technical implementation
 - Knowledge as a means not an end.
 - Community knowledge over individual expertise
 - Social infrastructure as digital infrastructure; digital infrastructure as social infrastructure
 - Sustainable practices over optimization for its own sake
 - Authentic voice in human-AI collaboration
