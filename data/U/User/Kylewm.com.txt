<dfn><span class="h-card">Kyle Mahan</span></dfn> (was <nowiki>kylewm.com</nowiki>) ran [[Woodwind]] and [[silo.pub]] and contributed to [[Bridgy]] and [[Known]].

== Itches ==
* [https://github.com/kylewm/woodwind/issues/47 Reply chains] in Woodwind
* Offload image hosting to another server. Thinking about S3 for <nowiki>kylewm.com</nowiki> and imgix for woodwind.
** Benchmark how many images woodwind is serving right now.
* custom slugs on <nowiki>kylewm.com</nowiki> -- on higher importance/visibility posts, I'd like the option to edit the auto-generated slug (e.g. "rsvp-indieweb-summit-2016").
* preserve timezones on reply contexts and received comments rather than converting everything to P[SD]T

=== On Hold ===
* Write a plugin to show better [https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1344 reply contexts] in Known
* Plugin installer & updater for Known
* Recognize mentions that are actually person tags in Known

=== Completed ===
* Add [https://github.com/kylewm/silo.pub/issues/17 GitHub support] to silo.pub (2016-04-22)
* Accept [https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/164 front-page mentions] in Known
* Add /authorship support to mf2util. [https://github.com/kylewm/mf2util/commit/aabb83415f35b74e7880fbb496921f91b370a049 2016-04-23]
* Simplify authorization in silo.pub so it will automatically register an account the first time you indieauth. [https://github.com/kylewm/silo.pub/commit/3f8db080f7b99a6485d5d3422a73fe616208f264 2016-04-22]

=== Archive ===

I archived a bunch of my [[User:Kylewm.com/Old_Itches|older itches here]]. Like a Netflix queue, over time, they'd become a big list of things that I empirically ''don't'' want to work on :)
