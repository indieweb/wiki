== My IndieWeb Setup ==
https://kimberlyhirsh.com is my primary home hosted on [[micro.blog]] where I post [[notes]], [[articles]], and [[photos]]. I manually POSSE some, but not all, posts to [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]]. I use Micro.blog's newsletter feature to send subscribers a weekly digest of all my posts. I use Micro.blog's bookshelves feature to track my reading.
