== Itches ==
=== To Do ===
* Customize RSS template so posts without titles don't display any title in feed.
* Customize CSS to have different font-family, font-size, and menu display.
* Fix uploads so all non-photos are not JPGs and all photos are JPGs.
* Establish and apply a categorization system.
* Create landing pages for notable groups of posts, e.g. dissertating in the open, lit review tips.
* Apply [https://help.micro.blog/2018/tagmoji/ tagmoji] to older posts and use filters to categorize them. (Still deciding whether to do this a single category at a time or just try to get it all in at once.)
* Fix single post template so JavaScript is at the end of the content.

=== Done ===
* Fix single post template so micro.blog replies only display once.
* Customize homepage to include h-entry and h-feed.
