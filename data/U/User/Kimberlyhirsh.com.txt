== My IndieWeb Setup ==
[http://kimberlyhirsh.com] is my primary online presence. I use [[WordPress]] with the IndieWeb plug-ins and [[POSSE]] using [[Jetpack]] Publicize to syndicate to [[Medium]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Google_Plus]]. I post [[notes]], [[articles]], [[bookmarks]], [[photos]], [[read]]s, and [[listen]]s. 

== Itches ==
* Document which features from silos I want on my site.
* Wean myself from silos.

== Working on ==
* Weaning from Facebook:
** Download data from Facebook. 
** Log in to remaining "Logged in with Facebook" apps using email address instead
** Check only on Fridays for responses to POSSE, syndication links, event invites, and interesting group conversations
* Weaning from Flickr:
** Download data from Flickr.

== Completed ==
* Weaning from Facebook:
** Unfollowed all friends, pages, and groups
** Purged most "Logged in with Facebook" apps
** Left most groups
* Started manually adding syndication links for items POSSEd via Jetpack Publicize.
