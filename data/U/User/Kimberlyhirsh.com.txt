I use [[WordPress]] with the IndieWeb plugins and [[POSSE]] using [[Jetpack]] Publicize to syndicate to [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Google_Plus]]. I use the Cross-post to [[Medium]] plugin. I post [[notes]], [[articles]], [[bookmarks]], [[photos]], [[read]]s, and [[listen]]s.

Though I'm not yet an [[IndieWeb]] [[creator]], I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and information architecture. I'm working on learning PHP and microformats. I would like to learn more in the future about JavaScript, UX, visual design, and typography.
