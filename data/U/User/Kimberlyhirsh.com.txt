== My IndieWeb set up ==
http://kimberlyhirsh.com is my primary home where I post:
* [[notes]] and 
**auto-[[POSSE]] them via Bridgy/Syndication Links to: [[Twitter]] - http://twitter.com/kimberlyhirsh
** manually [[POSSE]] them to [[Facebook]] - http://facebook.com/kimberlyhirsh
* [[articles]] and 
** auto-[[POSSE]] their name/title and permalink to [[Twitter]] - http://twitter.com/kimberlyhirsh
** manually [[POSSE]] their name/title and permalink to
*** [[Facebook]] - http://facebook.com/kimberlyhirsh
*** [[LinkedIn]] - http://linkedin.com/in/kimberlyhirsh
*** [[Tumblr]] - http://kimberlyhirsh.tumblr.com

* [[photos]] and [[PESOS]] them via [[OwnYourGram]] from [[Instagram]] - http://instagram.com/kimberlyhirsh

I use [[WordPress]] along with the IndieWeb [[WordPress/Plugins]]. I use the following additional plugins for added IndieWeb functionality:
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-hyperlink-urls/ Auto-hyperlink URLs]
* [https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-automatically-link-twitter-usernames-in-wordpress/ WPB Linkify Twitter Usernames]
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-link-preview/ WP Link Preview]

== Current Projects ==
* Documenting my IndieWeb implementation
* Tracking [[read]]s to look for features I want to implement as I come to understand [[microformats]] better
* Manually posting [[highlight]]s and [[marginalia]]

== Itches ==
* Clean up tags.
* Customize permalinks that currently have numeric slugs with semantic slugs.
* Experiment with enabling & creating additional types of [[posts]] in the [[Post Kinds Plugin]].
** For example, a make post type to track progress on/completion of a craft project (thinking of [http://www.ravelry.com Ravelry] as a place to look for inspiration)
* Archive my tweets on my own site per {{chrisaldrich}}'s [https://boffosocko.com/2016/12/05/how-to-own-display-your-twitter-archive-on-your-website-in-under-10-minutes/ workflow]

== Skills ==
* HTML
* CSS
* WordPress management

== IndieWeb blog posts ==
