'''Amalfi''' is an IndieWeb application built using [[Python]] and [[Flask]] that is currently in development by {{Myles}}.

People using it on their own site:

* {{Myles}} | https://mylesbraithwaite.com/ | https://braithwaite.io/
* ...

== Features ==

* Flat [[file-storage|File Storage]]
* Support for HTML, Markdown, Plain Text, and Jupyter Notebooks
* Post Types: [[note]], [[article]], [[photo]], [[bookmark]], [[checkin]], [[rsvp]]

== Implementation Design ==

=== Storage Format ===

I took a lot of inspiration from {{aaronpk}}'s [[p3k#Storage|p3k]] folder and file structure.

All the content for the website is stored in a Git repository and mirrored to an [[Amazon_S3|S3]] bucket.

There is a main folder ''posts'' which contain the individual post files. Post are stored in a structure of <code>posts/%Y/%m/%j/index</code> (example the third post on 13 March 2018 would be <code>posts/2018/03/072/03</code>).

In a individual post directory there is always a <code>_meta.toml</code> for storing information about the post, all h-entry variables are supported. In the directory there is also h-entry variables as text files (ex summary.txt, content.md, etc).

A posts folder structure looks like:

 .
 └── posts
     └── 2018
         └── 072
             └── 01
                 ├── _meta.toml
                 ├── summary.txt
                 ├── content.md
                 └── media
                     └── photo.jpg

=== Mention Support ===

Amalfi has the ability to mention a Person, Group, or Location.

* person  - use a tilde (ex. <code>~Myles</code>)
* group - use an exclamation mark (<code>!MiyS</code>)
* location - use an at (<code>@HackLabTO</code>)

== Etymology ==

'''Amalfi Project''' was randomly selected using [https://www.intralinks.com/ma-project-name-generator M&A Project Name Generator].
