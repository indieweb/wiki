== About Me ==

I’m a designer, writer, and software engineer with about 20 years of experience, mostly in web and game development. These days I mostly make narrative games, with a wide variety of cool people. Some of my games have been submitted to competitions such as Ludum Dare and IFComp, others have been worked on commercially and with teams. I’ve previously designed websites artists and musicians, done research for a number of universities in Boston, and performed as a contortionist in Renaissance Faires and circus shows.

For fun, I play strategy games, cook and bake vegan food, draw, write, practice circus arts, and make music.

I've been on the IndieWeb since 2015.
