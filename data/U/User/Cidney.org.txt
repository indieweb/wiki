I'm Cidney, a narrative game developer currently based out of Berlin. I'm a Central Florida native and have also lived in Boston, Paris, and New York. I'm probably most notable for working on Sierra Renaissance games.

I've been following the IndieWeb movement since 2015, and have been making websites since I was a kid. My website is [[IndieMark#Level_1]].
