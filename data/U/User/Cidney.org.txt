== About Me ==

I’m a designer, writer, and software engineer with about 20 years of experience, mostly in web and game development. These days I mostly make narrative games, with a wide variety of cool people. Some of my games have been submitted to competitions such as Ludum Dare and IFComp, others have been worked on commercially and with teams. I’ve previously designed websites artists and musicians, done research for a number of universities in Boston, and performed as a contortionist in Renaissance Faires and circus shows.

I currently live and work in New York City, but am a native of Satellite Beach, Florida. I’ve lived in Paris and Berlin with my spouse, Alon Levy, and went to university and lived near Cambridge, Massachusetts for 10 years. I’m a native English speaker with reading proficiency in French and conversational proficiency in German. I obtained a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Wellesley College in 2011 as an Elizabeth Kaiser Davis Scholar, and studied at Harvard, MIT, Tufts, Florida Tech, and Massachusetts College of Art.

For fun, I play strategy games, cook and bake vegan food, draw, write, practice circus arts, and make music.
