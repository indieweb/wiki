hi there, i'm melo! i'm 20 years old (as of writing) and use [https://pronouns.within.lgbt/she/her/her/hers/herself she/her] pronouns.

i'm very passionate about many things, including:

* '''self-hosting''': i am an ''extremely'' prolific self-hoster, having lost count of all the services i have hosted. my most notable self-hosted projects can be found in the following section.
* '''the internet''': i have a lot of hope for the internet. i grew up on it, the internet being a lifeline for me during tough times as a kid, and the current state of it makes me angry more than sad. i have faith that we as a community can change things for the better!
* '''music''': also a lifeline for me through difficult times. i love japanese and korean idol groups, and often obsess over them, but i'm also a fan of about any genre you can think of.

=== my personal websites ===

* [https://girlonthemoon.xyz/ girl on the moon]: kind of my "IRL-sona" site, with pictures/video of me and everything. a bit barren.
* [https://eunoia.sayitditto.net/ eunoia]: where i goof off and do more personal stuff than GOTM can allow for (being my more IRL-facing site)
* [https://bubblegum.girlonthemoon.xyz/ bubblegum]: my blog! the code is written 100% by me, originally based on the ruby on rails version 7 getting started guide. 

== notable projects ==

* [https://superlove.sayitditto.net/ superlove]: in late 2023 i self-hosted the code for the biggest fanfiction site in the world, [[Archive of our own|AO3]], and have never been normal since.
* [https://kat.love4eva.net/profile/ love4eva]: you remember [[LiveJournal|livejournal]]? did you know there's a still-actively-developed fork of it called [https://www.dreamwidth.org/ dreamwidth]? well i self hosted the latter, ''and'' am the first person to do it [https://stash.4-walls.net/selfhostdw exclusively in docker].
