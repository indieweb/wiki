== Intro ==
I'm a graphic designer and writer in the Seattle area. I blogged through college, took a few years off in the 2000s, and have been blogging at [https://cascadiainspired.com Cascadia Inspired] since 2012. 

== Websites ==
My main blog is [https://cascadiainspired.com Cascadia Inspired], where I write about creative work and finding inspiration in nature. I'm running a [https://sensememory.cascadiainspired.com/ short-term art project on a subdomain] as a pandemic project, with the plan to somehow compile posts into "seasons" like magazine issues in the future.

I use [https://tracydurnell.com tracydurnell.com] as a mind garden to track articles I've read and shows and videos I've watched. I'm [https://tracydurnell.com/reading-list/ tracking books I read] there too.

I use Wordpress for everything and have webhosting through HostGator. (I'm not a developer, just do basic HTML and CSS.)

== Working On ==
* [[mascot]]
* [[2021/homepage]]

== Itches ==
=== Personal Websites ===
* Set up a way to track more personal stuff like exercise and meals, that I don't want in my "intake" / "processing" content feed - I'm thinking maybe on a subdomain? 
** May 2021 - set up Micro.blog but can't figure out how to get the subdomain to work
** August 2021 - got a Fitbit and set up IFTTT to post private posts about my sleep stats and daily heart rate minutes on my blog
* Figure out a good way to track "to read" books, and include a note about why I want to read it to make it better than Goodreads - use tags in place of shelves?
* Figure out a homepage layout for my mind garden that makes it feel like less of a feed - I'm thinking something like a "magazine" layout with blocks for each either category or post type - potentially displaying some random posts as well 
* Would love to figure out how to somehow display a visual web of articles linked by tags but I think that's way outside my skillset - instead maybe adding links to other articles with similar tags on post pages? 
** Ideally would love a dynamic visualization similar to [https://tracydurnell.com/2021/05/19/went-to-homebrew-website-club-4/ this suggestion for threaded convos]
** Could probably use a suggested posts plugin to do similar
** A simpler visualization method could be kind of Venn diagram-ish representations by category or tag, showing how other tags overlap with the selected category or tag - e.g. for books would be interesting to see relative prevalence of overlapping tags like novella, non-fiction, etc. 
* Adding a visual representation of how much of a numeric goal I accomplished in my quarterly personal reviews
* Redesign my author website (under a pen name) which is using a generic template

=== IndieWeb Projects ===
* create an IndieWeb mascot
* update color palette and incorporate into the wiki CSS
* equivalent of a nownownow opt-in directory of IndieWeb folks?
* IndieWeb (versus IndieWebCamp) logo and icon
* cleanup of key IndieWeb wiki pages for improved readability for new folks

=== Done ===
* Set up SSL on both websites
** 2021 - ok this took 15 minutes
