== Introduction ==
I'm a graphic designer and writer in the Seattle area. I started blogging in 2003, took a few years off in the 2000s, and have been blogging at [http://cascadiainspired.com Cascadia Inspired] since 2012. 

== Websites ==
My main blog is [http://cascadiainspired.com Cascadia Inspired], where I write about creative work and finding inspiration in nature.

I use [http://tracydurnell.com tracydurnell.com] as a mind garden to track things I've read and watched.
