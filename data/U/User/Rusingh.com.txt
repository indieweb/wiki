Hi, I’m Ru Singh. I’m an in­de­pen­dent front-end web de­vel­oper who works with sta­tic site gen­er­a­tors, React, and WordPress.

My site is built on top of [[Eleventy]] and includes [[Webmentions]] support via [[webmention.io]]. Webmentions from Fosstodon (a Mastodon instance) and Twitter are also backfed via [[brid.gy]].
