Hi, I’m Ru Singh[https://rusingh.com/]. I’m an in­de­pen­dent front-end web de­vel­oper who works with sta­tic site gen­er­a­tors, React, and WordPress. I write a blog[https://rusingh.com/articles/] and my thoughts[https://rusingh.com/thoughts/].

My site is built on top of [[Eleventy]] and includes [[Webmentions]] support via [[webmention.io]]. Webmentions from Fosstodon (a Mastodon instance) and Twitter are also backfed via [[brid.gy]].
