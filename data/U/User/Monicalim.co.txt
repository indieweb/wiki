I’m Monica Lim. I’m a special projects manager — the person you bring in when you have an idea that needs structure, momentum, and a real finish line. I’ve spent years running lean teams across all kinds of projects, and I share notes on how I work (plus whatever I’m curious about lately).

I also write about the personal side of life: parenting, relationships, and the small habits that shape how we show up.
