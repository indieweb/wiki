This contributor has noped out.  (Reason: "The community is too hostile—to point of detriment to its own wiki[https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=discuss&diff=73270&oldid=73204][https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=discuss&diff=73697&oldid=73694]—and about as cliquey as I suspected.")


== Seriously? ==
Note from another wiki editor: This person showed up on our wiki, started editing and refining without ever dropping in to our chats, calls community hostile because some of their edits got reverted. 
Draw your own conclusions.
