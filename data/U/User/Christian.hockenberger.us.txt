I am Christian Hockenberger, an Art Director from somewhere near Mannheim, Germany. In a conversation about microformats, my ex-colleague [[User:Notiz.blog|Matthias Pfefferle]] introduced me to the indieweb. I was immediately convinced.

== Working On ==

* '''My website is outdated. I'm working on the follow-up page since spring 2021. Without any drive during the pandemic...'''
* I am currently revamping my website - reclaiming, editing, and presenting my content, fitting the design, making it my center on the internet.
* As a by-product of my website I will create a WordPress theme which includes microformats and schema.org and supports all relevant indieweb plugins seamlessly.
