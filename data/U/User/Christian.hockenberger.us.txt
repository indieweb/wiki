I am Christian Hockenberger, a designer from somewhere near Mannheim, Germany. In a conversation about microformats, my ex-colleague [[User:Notiz.blog|Matthias Pfefferle]] introduced me to the indieweb. I was immediately convinced.

== Working On ==

* I am currently revamping my website - reclaiming, editing and presenting my content, fitting the design, making it my centre on the internet.
* As a by-product of my website I will create a WordPress theme which includes microformats and schema.org and supports all relevant indieweb plugins seamlessly.
