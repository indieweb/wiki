Hello!

I categorize my online activities into read-only, write-only, and interactive ones. My current preferred solution for each category are web feeds, a static blog, and email.

= Principles =
* I try to rely on external services as little as possible.
* I don't want to touch JS nor databases.
* I would like to keep the blogging workflow detached from the server.

= Itches =
* Unify workflow for responses. I currently use a email powered HTML form and a local parser script for comments and webmention.io for webmentions (I just check these manually). Perhaps I can set up my own end point with an WSGI script to convert incoming webmentions into emails.
* Native ActivityPub support. Writing on Mastodon and maintaining it feels rather burdensome when a simple twtxt.txt does 99% of what I want it to do. Using brid.gy would still require me to keep the Mastodon server up, so that's not an option. My first dab at ActivityPub was frustrating at least, not to mention all the weird extensions Mastodon spun up. Maybe it's not worth it after all, or maybe we need a smaller but stricter set of standard to adhere to for the protocol? There is [https://litepub.social/litepub/ LitePub], but there doesn't seem to be much activity.
