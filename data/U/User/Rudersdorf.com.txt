I have been interested in IndieWeb Techniques for a long time but just recently started working on my own website. Not a huge fan of spending time on ANY Social Media Platform out there. Hoping that POSSE and my beloved RSS feeds will allow me to stay connected without spending too much time on Social Media.

== IndieWebCamps I've attended ==

* Berlin (2024)
* Düsseldorf (2023)
* Düsseldorf (can´t remember the year)

== IndieWeb techniques I use ==

* During IWC 2023 I´ve managed to set up [[Micropub]] for [https://ia.net/de/writer/features iA Writer] and now I can publish text from my phone
* Using [[microformats]] for as many microformattable content as possible
* Started setting up [[Webmention]] but it's not yet ready to go
* I use [https://11ty.dev Eleventy] to build my Static Site from Markdown formatted files. This is how I keep all text I write on my computer
* I publish at least one RSS feed
* I have a [[personal-domain|personal domain]] (and that counts as a checkmark on my indie list)
* I've connected some services like github using [[rel-me|rel=me]] and also got myself a PGP key so I can use [[IndieAuth]]
