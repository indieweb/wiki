Hello. I'm '''Chris'''.

I have a website at https://cj.w6k.ca/ that runs a software I made called webfoo. It includes an indieauth server and a micropub server.

I publish the open-source software I write at https://code.cjwillcock.ca/. 

I am not a member of any silos. You won't find me on GitHub, Twitter etc. That may change again sometime. Not soon probably.

I'm in chat too, cjw6k.
