Hello. I'm '''Chris'''.

I have been coding since I was a teen in the mid-90s and have an on-again-off-again relationship with self-publishing. 

I have a website at https://cj.w6k.ca/ that runs a software I made called webfoo. It includes an indieauth server and a micropub server.

Webfoo has no UI except a Log Out button. I make all my posts with micropub clients. For editing I use vim directly on the webserver or notepad++ via winscp. Micropub clients I am so happy to be able to use include:

* [[shpub]]
* clementine-juicer https://code.cjwillcock.ca/experiments/clementine-juicer
* [[Omnibear]]
* [[Quill]]
* [[Indigenous for Android]]

I wrote an mf2 parser as a PHP extension and am writing an HTML parser as a PHP extension. Neither one has a stable version. 

I self-publish the software I author and own, at https://code.cjwillcock.ca/.
