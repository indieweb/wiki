Hello. I'm '''Chris'''.

I have a website at https://cj.w6k.ca/ that runs a software I made called webfoo. It includes an indieauth server and a micropub server. I'm working on adding webmentions lately.

Webfoo has no UI except a Log Out button. I make all my posts with micropub clients. For editing I use vim directly on the webserver or notepad++ via winscp. Micropub clients I am so happy to be able to use include:

* [[shpub]]
* clementine-juicer https://code.cjwillcock.ca/experiments/clementine-juicer
* [[Omnibear]]
* [[Quill]]
* [[Indigenous for Android]]

I wrote an mf2 parser as a PHP extension and am writing an HTML parser as a PHP extension. Neither one has a stable version. Webfoo gives me a use case.

I publish the open-source software I write at https://code.cjwillcock.ca/.

I'm in chat too, cjw6k.
