== Stuart, aka, s2art, stu or just s2. ==
Although I have had my own <a href="http://stunik.com">website</a> since 2002 or so, this is my beginning of my foray into to the Indieweb.

I blog at <a href="http://stunik.com.blog/">my self hosted Wordpress blog</a>.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/s2art/albums">Flickr</a> is really my cyber-home, it's where I was truly initiated into the world that is the web.

You can also find me on the following services

<a href="http://s2z.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>

an instance of mastodon called <a href="@s2art@sunny.garden
sunny.garden">sunny.garden</a>

<a href="https://pixelfed.social/i/web/profile/341520792774367714">Pixelfed</a>

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/s2zart/">instagram</a>

Here's a <a href="http://stunik.com/gallery/all_projects.html">link to my page of my online stuff</a>

I'm on threads and twitter and Bluesky, but hey as a visual person these platforms are pretty secondary.
