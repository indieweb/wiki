My name is Adam. I am a grad student studying medical imaging.

== My site ==
My site is generated with [[Jekyll]] and hosted on [[GitHub Pages]]. I use [https://aarongustafson.github.io/jekyll-webmention_io/ jekyll-webmention_io] to receive [[Webmentions]] and to [[POSSE]] posts to social media via [[Bridgy]] and [[Bridgy Fed]].

I post on my site using Apple [[Shortcuts]] from my phone as a [[Micropub]] client. The [[Micropub]] server is a [https://github.com/saundersresearch/micropub modified version] of {{benji}}'s serverless-micropub to support Jekyll.

== Itches ==
* Set up a [[Microsub]] server and integrate with a [[feed reader]]
* Set up an [[IndieAuth]] server
* Add instructions on how [[responses]] work on my site for people who aren't familiar with [[webmentions]]
* Post about [[Getting Started]] on the IndieWeb as an academic.
* Play with getting my site built on alternative protocols like [[Gemini protocol]]
* Set up an automated [[POSSE]] system for when research articles I co-author are posted.
* Create a method for posting knitting/crochet projects on my site

== Done ==
* Set up a way to post to my site from my phone, maybe with [[Micropub]]
* Replace Giscus for replies on my site with [[webmentions]], maybe with [[commentpara.de]]
* Add [[about]], [[ideas]], and [[now]] pages
