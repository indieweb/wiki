Hi, Doug here.  I was vaguely aware of IndieWeb because of the 2016 [[XOXO]] IndieWeb slack channel meetup.  Fast forward to the [[micro.blog]] kickstarter, which tickled the idea that I had been Yak shaving rather than blogging!  I dusted off my lifetime ASmallOrange account, installed WordPress, and headed to [[2017|IndieWeb Summit 2017]] in Portland.  I learned a lot, named [indiewebring|🕸💍], kept running into limitations of shared hosting, and [[2017#Photos|channeled my inner 🐲]].
