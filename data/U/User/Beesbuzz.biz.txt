Hi, I'm fluffy!

I focus on building tools for more general-purpose content management that integrates with the IndieWeb, and release them under the auspices of the [https://github.com/PlaidWeb PlaidWeb organization].

Software of note:

* [http://publ.beesbuzz.biz/ Publ] - a general-purpose website CMS which tries to take the best aspects of static and dynamic publishing. Major focus on flexibly supporting heterogenous content types; I use it to publish [http://beesbuzz.biz/ my website]. It is designed with the UNIX philosophy in mind and is designed to keep sites portable and more or less stateless.
* [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl Pushl] - a companion tool for sending push notifications (WebSub and WebMention) to consumer endpoints from CMSes that don't have built-in support for such things. Like Publ. It can also be used with arbitrary static site generators (Jekyll, Pelican, etc.).
* [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Authl Authl] - a Python library that will hopefully wrap up federated identity into an easier-to-use API (see [https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/4122-Authl-Yet-another-project-I-dont-have-time-for my explanation of why]); the goal is to support any identification scheme that can be encapsulated in a profile URL

I also am one of the current maintainers of [https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Feed-On-Feeds Feed on Feeds], a legacy PHP-based RSS/Atom reader.
