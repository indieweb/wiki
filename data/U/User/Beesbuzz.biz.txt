Hi, I'm fluffy!

I focus on building tools for more general-purpose content management that integrates with the IndieWeb, and release them under the auspices of the [https://github.com/PlaidWeb PlaidWeb organization]. My main focus is on making [http://beesbuzz.biz my own website] easier to manage, particularly since I use it to publish a lot of different kinds of content.

Software of note:

* [http://publ.beesbuzz.biz/ Publ] - a general-purpose website CMS which tries to take the best aspects of static and dynamic publishing. Major focus on flexibly supporting heterogenous content types; I use it to publish [http://beesbuzz.biz/ my website]. It is designed with the UNIX philosophy in mind and is designed to keep sites portable and be more or less stateless on its own.
* [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl Pushl] - a companion tool for sending push notifications (WebSub and WebMention) to consumer endpoints from CMSes that don't have built-in support for such things. Like Publ. It can also be used with arbitrary static site generators (Jekyll, Pelican, etc.).
* [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Authl Authl] - a Python library that will hopefully wrap up federated identity into an easier-to-use API (see [https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/4122-Authl-Yet-another-project-I-dont-have-time-for my explanation of why]); the goal is to support any identification scheme that can be encapsulated in a profile URL

I also am one of the current maintainers of [[Feed on Feeds]], a legacy PHP-based RSS/Atom reader.

== On project naming ==

Originally I named Publ (short for "publish") to go along with another planned project, Subl, a feed reader, as a pun on Pub/Sub. I've not ended up working on Subl (despite still wanting to replace FeedOnFeeds with something more modern/maintainable someday) but it still established a naming convention and I decided to just run with it.

If you like, you can pretend "Authl" is short for "authentication library" and "Pushl" is short for... "push... l"
