Who is sugardave.com?

That's me!  I have been around the block a few times with this whole Internet thing since 1991 (yikes!), and still I have never really managed to make a mark content-wise.  I stumbled across IndieWeb by chance a couple of years ago and it stuck with me as a worthwhile pursuit should I ever try my hand at content creation again.

So, it looks like I am going to do that.

Here's a high-level list of things I'd like to accomplish:

* <s>Get IndieAuth authentication endpoint working on my personal domain</s>
* Decide on a site/content platform for content creation
* Brainstorm ideas for what kind(s) of content to create
* Determine which syndication avenues to pursue
* Create content

That's all for now!
