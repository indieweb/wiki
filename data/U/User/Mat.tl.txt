== Matt Lee == 

[[File:mattl.png‎]]

I'm Matt Lee, one of the folks behind behind Foo Communications, a company/experiment in music and social media, including Libre.fm, a new social media platform that offers musicians exclusive promotion and play in exchange for licensing their music under a free culture license, and GNU social, a federated social networking project.

You might know me from my very long stint working with the FSF. I am somewhat still there, albeit as a volunteer working on GNU things.

I also spend a lot of time doing other stuff, including making films and TV shows. 

I still live in Boston for the time being, but I am considering a move to the West Coast. I tried Austin and didn’t like it. I spend a lot of my time on the road lately.

I’m on the other wiki too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Lee_(artist)

<s>I'm at Creative Commons doing various tech stuff with free software.</s>
I'm at the Handshake Foundation and I'm also Engineering Manager on OpenArchive.

I am irretrievably 'mattl' in most places.
