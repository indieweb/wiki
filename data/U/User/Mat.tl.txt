I mostly paint Warhammer models now. Or try to. 

I am slowly doing something with [[Libre.fm]] again but as something different (not music)

"AI"/LLM is just another in the list of grifts from the people who brought you NFT, Web3, Blockchain, that crypto currency your neighbor lost their life savings on and more. I wish folks who have been doing machine learning and real-AI stuff (like MIT's CSAIL) would scream from the rooftops and use every opportunity possible to point this out. I don't consent to having my work stolen to train the stealing machines.
