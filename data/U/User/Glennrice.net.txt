== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Glenn. I've been on the internet since at least 1995 when HTML was the "thing" and I started my first website and blog in 1999 while I was working in Papua New Guinea as a way of keeping friends and family back home updated. I started with hand-coded HTML then went through a series of CMS's: Blogger, Greymatter, MovableType  and WordPress.
