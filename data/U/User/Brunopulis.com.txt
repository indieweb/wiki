== '''Hi, I'm Bruno!''' ==

But you can call me Pulis (my last name).
I'm a fan of open source and have been blogging since the 2000s. 
I met IndieWeb recently, and I'm loving it all. 

I'm working on my site to be a place where I manage my links, movies, books and more.

== Open Source Projects ==

I have open-sourced a number of components behind my website on GitHub. My open-source projects are usually named after the function they provide.

Here are the open-source projects I have written so far:

* [https://github.com/brunopulis/awesome-a11y brunopulis/awesome-a11y]
* [https://github.com/brunopulis/awesome-cypress brunopulis/awesome-cypress]
