I keep more details of my tech stack on a page [https://maya.land/technicalities/ here]. Particular indieweb efforts I'd like to shout out:

* Horst Gutmann's [[webmentiond]]
* whoever added mf2 markup to the [https://github.com/jekyll/minima default jekyll theme]
* [[bridgy]] is life, bridgy is love

This stuff has really made my website hobby sing, so thank you to everyone involved!
