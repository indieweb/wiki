== Introduction ==
I'm Zephyr Prusinski, a web developer by trade for an undisclosed number of years. I run the Philly Homebrew Website Club which has been running since August 2025. I also perform livecoded music and visuals occasionally under the moniker Moon Pox.

== Website ==
My personal website is https://zephnet.biz - a [[Hugo]] site hosted on [https://pages.cloudflare.com/ Cloudflare Pages] using Cloudflare's ecosystem to run a serverless [[Micropub|micropub]] and media endpoint. The site is under active development and the repository is on [[GitHub]] - https://github.com/zazzyzeph/zephnet

== Working On ==
* Micropub endpoint - Still working out pulling alt text from [[Quill]]'s image section. Currently manually adding it after-the-fact and pushing the updated markdown file.

== Itches ==
* Use [[Bridgy|brid.gy]] to syndicate to bluesky and mastodon
* A well-compressed web font would be nice
