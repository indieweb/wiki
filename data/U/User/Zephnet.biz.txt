== Introduction ==
I'm Zephyr Prusinski, a web developer by trade for an undisclosed number of years. I run the Philly Homebrew Website Club which has been running since August 2025. I also perform livecoded music and visuals occasionally under the moniker zndb.

== Website ==
My personal website is https://zephnet.biz - a [[Hugo]] site hosted on [https://pages.cloudflare.com/ Cloudflare Pages] using Cloudflare's ecosystem to run a serverless [[Micropub|micropub]] and media endpoint. The site is under active development and the repository is on [[GitHub]] - https://github.com/zazzyzeph/zephnet
