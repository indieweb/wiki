It supports quite a few interesting features:

* '''Location Tracking''' - I use Owntracks to automatically track my location and save the locations to my site. You can see everywhere I've been at [https://grant.codes/maps grant.codes/maps]
* '''Journaling''' - I create private posts as a journal. They are just micropub posts with certain categories. There is then a hidden ui to view them when logged in. I have a daily notification on my phone to write a quick journal (almost) every day
* '''Timeline''' - An infinite timeline of all my public activity [https://grant.codes/timeline grant.codes/timeline]
* '''CLI Interface''' - There is a CLI interface for managing certain parts of the backend such as authenticating with silos and basic management of posts.
