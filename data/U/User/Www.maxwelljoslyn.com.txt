<span class="p-summary">Maxwell Joslyn is me. [http://www.maxwelljoslyn.com maxwelljoslyn.com] is my website.</span>

== Itches ==
* write: Python or shell: automatic sending of webmentions post-deployment (may have to deal with Frustrating Caching)
* write: Python: move per-post metadata extraction out to loop that writes blog index lines, so that I can write list of tags after each post's index entry
* <del>write: Emacs: function to construct (and maybe insert) person-tag HTML given a link and a name</del> 2019-11-22
* download a local copy of the [[chat-names]] page to serve as a directory from which to fill [[person-tag]]s
* write: Emacs: function to suggest chat-names data when constructing person-tag
* write: Emacs: function/command to insert link with my choice of mf2 classes
* experiment: move website build process from local machine to server (precursor to any posting setup which involves transferring stuff to the server and kicking off a rebuild)
* add: list of holidays, starting with Old Year's Eve
* rewrite: Python: Hakyll routing
* hope fervently: for the day when I do everything in Lisp and my website rules and you can do a kickflip with it and there's an API for printing money
