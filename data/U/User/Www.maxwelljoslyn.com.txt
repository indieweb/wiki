<span class="p-summary">Maxwell Joslyn is me. [http://www.maxwelljoslyn.com maxwelljoslyn.com] is my website.</span>

== Itches ==
* write: Python or shell: sending of webmentions
* write: Hakyll function F :: a -> Context which exposes post metadata to template engine
* write: Emacs command to insert link with my choice of mf2 classes
* download a local copy of the [[chat-names]] page to serve as a directory from which to fill [[person-tag]]s
* write: Emacs function to pull in chat-names
* experiment: move website build process from local machine to server (precursor to any posting setup which involves transferring stuff to the server and kicking off a rebuild)
* add: list of holidays, starting with Old Year's Eve
* rewrite: Python: Hakyll routing
* hope fervently: for the day when I do everything in Lisp and my website rules and you can do a kickflip with it and there's an API for printing money
