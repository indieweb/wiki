== Itches ==
* automate the sending of webmentions
* write Emacs command to insert link with my choice of mf2 classes
* incorporate a local copy of the [[chat-names]] page to serve as a directory from which to fill [[person-tag]]s
* attempt to move website build process from local machine to server (precursor to any posting setup which involves transferring stuff to the server and kicking off a rebuild)
