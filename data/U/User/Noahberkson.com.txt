Hi, I’m Noah Berkson — and my home base on the web is '''[https://noahberkson.com/ noahberkson.com]'''.

I use my site as a place to share notes, stories, and lessons I’m collecting — mostly around people, connection, and building a life (and work) that feels meaningful.

== What I’m up to ==
I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and lately I’ve been especially interested in the “human skills” that matter more (not less) as technology changes — things like communication, trust, and community. I also host a few communities and gatherings built around depth, authenticity, and real connection.
