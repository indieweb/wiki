'''[https://noahberkson.com/ noahberkson.com]''' is my personal website.

I write in public — mostly essays, stories, and “thinking out loud” about business, relationships, and the human side of building things. I’m a multi-time founder, and a lot of my energy goes into creating better ways for people to connect (not just network).

== What you’ll find here ==
* Essays + notes (often about communication, community, and ambition)
* Experiments, projects, and ideas I’m exploring
* Occasional reflections on AI and what stays uniquely human
