== Introduction ==
Hi! My name is Paulo. I've been on the internet since at least 1993. My first website was designed with DreamWeaver (WYSIWYG)  hosted in Geocities.

I work in institutional communication at the City Hall, Portugal, as an Aide to the Mayor. 

I have several interests: microblogging, indieweb, hamradio, astronomy, aviation, trains, photography, literature, philosophy among others! 

Lately, I've been interested in Cyberculture and Online Privacy.

== Main Website ==
My primary site ([http://paulopinto.org Paulopinto.org]) is powered by [[WordPress]] and using ([https://github.com/dshanske/iw26 IW26]) a fork of the Wordpress Twenty Sixteen theme by David Shanske.

== Other Websites ==
Microblogging: ([http://paulopinto.page Paulopinto.page]) powered by [[micro.blog]].
Hamradio: ([http://ct1ete.xyz Ct1ete.xyz]) powered by Hugo + Github + Netlify.
