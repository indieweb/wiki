<h3>Hi!</h3>

<p>
I'm Dylan Harris. I've had a website up for a couple of decades. It's all my own cat food. Don't go visiting it, it's running on an Intel chip so old it's immune to Meltdown. I have to upgrade.
</p>

<p>
I need to bring the site up to scratch for indiewebs. Most online verification pages are really rather rude about it. I have to make so many edits I think it's finally time I migrated from Notepad to sed. 
</p>

<p>
I'll update this page over the next few days/weeks as I get to know the climate here.
