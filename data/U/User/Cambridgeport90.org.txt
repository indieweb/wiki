|summary = Hi! I'm Katherine "Kat" Moss. I am from Boston Massachusetts, and really proud of it. I have been an Indieweb citizen since May of 2019, and my mind has been aglow ever since with ideas (see iches.) For the moment, you can find me: sitting at a piano, coding in either C# or PowerShell, or assisting somewhere in the community. My favourite stacks are .NET, PHP, Microsoft Windows, and OpenSUSE Linux.

=== Itches ===
*Modify the [https://github.com/pfefferle/Autonomie#:~:text=%22Autonomie%22%20is%20a%20highly%20semantic,%20responsive,%20accessible%20and,plugins%20and%20is%20fully%20IndieWeb%20compatible.%20-%20pfefferle/autonomie autonomie] theme so that it will show the timestamp of a post if not already done. (not having timestamps showing is starting to drive me nuts.)
*Create a webmention sender in order to be able to send webmentions from other .NET Core/NET Framework APIs
*Get enough of a hang of the PHP language so that the Read post kind will support reading status through [https://openlibrary.org open library]
