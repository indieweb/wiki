== IndieWeb Projects ==


* [http://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server Yarns Microsub Server]. A microsub server that runs on your WordPress site. 

* (deprecated in favour of Yarns Microsub Server) A wordpress-based feed [[reader]] named [[Yarns Indie Reader]]. Trying to incorporate my favourite parts of [[Woodwind]] and [[WhisperFollow]], plus scratch a few itches not covered by those.

== Itches == 

* Continue improving Yarns Microsub server.
** Parsing is getting good (thanks to David Shanske's Parse-This library), but I'll continue to improve it where possible.
** Figure out how to add WebSub support.
** Improve the UI of the admin.


* New layout for my website.  
** Recently, I'm teaching a lot of web design fundamentals, and it's making me itch to customize my site's look.
** My site uses WordPress so I'm planning to build a child theme atop either [https://github.com/dshanske/iw26 iw26] or [[IndieWeb_Publisher]].
** Still thinking of design ideas, but it'd better be [[fun]]
