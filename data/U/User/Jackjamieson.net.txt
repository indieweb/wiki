== IndieWeb Projects ==


* [http://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server Yarns Microsub Server]. Building upon Yarns Indie Reader to create a microsub server WordPress plugin. Not quite in working order yet but coming along well!


* (on hold while I focus on Yarns Microsub Server) A wordpress-based feed [[reader]] named [[Yarns Indie Reader]]. Trying to incorporate my favourite parts of [[Woodwind]] and [[WhisperFollow]], plus scratch a few itches not covered by those.

== Itches == 

* Get Yarns Microsub Server in working order. Pretty close as of now (July 2018), but working through some parsing issues.  
** Currently only parses h-feeds, need to port RSS/Atom support from Yarns Indie Reader
** Would like to add support for indiepaper
** Currently polls every hour, adding websub would be nice
