Some of current ideas:

* an alternate indie site open-source generator

* a RSS+email+indieweb+social media silos content reader

* open web moderation/reputation protocol

* web moderation as a service

* anything that improves journalism/fact-checking ( https://medium.com/@jtomaszewski/fact-checking-the-metoo-sexual-harassment-allegations-how-many-of-them-are-true-and-fair-e7d89a7f1452 )

* browser extension or a API that converts a website to machine-readable format (i.e. convert job offer / job offer form to machine-readable data; and apply to it automatically)

* Firebase for UI - Frontpage as a SaaS - Frontpage '98 but in a 2020 times (choose React components and connect them with live data comming from APIs instantly; connect it with CI/CD; web hooks, etc)

* Slack & Jira & Github & Confluence all in one place - but with an easy way to migrate from X to Y (yeah I know notion.so , but it's still not the thing for me)
** or maybe just a better Jira client ( https://medium.com/@jtomaszewski/15-reasons-why-jira-and-confluence-suck-37507361cbdf )

* web annotating tool
** we've got http://hypothes.is already, can't tell how could it be done better, besides some social useful features like https://highly.co had

* myutopy.com / politicians / "ideal politics profile" comparison tool
** current examples: https://mamprawowiedziec.pl , https://ontheissues.org/
** but I'd like to allow users to create their own "ideal policy profile" as well and let them compare it with other profiles

* better book/article reading experience - sth that Kindle should already have but it doesn't, i.e.:
** track how much time does the reader spend on each paragraph
** track when does the reader get lost
** track highlights
** save your highlights and easily browse them
** read excerpts of the others (goodreads, highlights)
** share it with the others
** merge reading, highlights with goodreads/excerpts?

* "Diary every day" like tookapic.com, but with written content

* Blogpay / Brave as a browser extension
** this seems to be solved soon with Web Monetization API ;)

* sth for education

* sth for learning foreign languages

* sth for learning a foreign language through watching movies (integrate it with dictionaries and make it more interactive by clicking on subtitles like  in Yabla )

* Silent Disco Party mobile app

* a book with drinking games (DIY cornhall; beerpong; etc)
