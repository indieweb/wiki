Symetre (stylized as <code>(symetre)</code>) is an attempt at encouraging selfhosting of indieweb services for use in static websites, instead of relying on their hosted counterparts. The idea being that each feature is an opt in module that exposes an API.

Symmetry is currently closed source and is not used on any indiewebsite. When it is ready it will be released under the AGPL [[license]] and will be [[selfdogfood]]ed by {{Evan Boehs}}

==== Send ====

An abstraction over manually sending webmentions to other sites.

Can accept one of two requests

==== Send/Store ====

Can distribute the store in one of two ways

* Consumer side HTML components (for easy integration with an otherwise static site)
* Via an API
  * As h-entry
  * As a normal microsub endoint

==== Receive ====

* h-entries
* As a normal microsub endoint

=== [[IndieAuth]] ===
