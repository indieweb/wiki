Symmetry is an attempt at encouraging selfhosting of indieweb services for use in static websites, instead of relying on their hosted counterparts. The idea being that each feature is an opt in module that exposes an API.

Symmetry is currently closed source and is not used on any indiewebsite. When it is ready it will be released under the AGPL [[license]] and will be [[selfdogfood]]ed by {{Evan Boehs}}
