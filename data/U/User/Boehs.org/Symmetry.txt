Symmetry is an attempt at encouraging selfhosting of indieweb services for use in static websites, instead of relying on their hosted counterparts. The idea being that each feature is an opt in module.

Symmetry is currently closed source and is not used on any indie web site. When it is ready it will be released under the AGPL [[license]]
