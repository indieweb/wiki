=== What I'm Working on Now ===

Hi, my name is Nick Gray and I live in Austin, Texas.

Below is a list of my current projects and what I’m working on these days.

[https://patronview.com/ '''Patron View''']
I built Patron View to help museums and cultural institutions understand their donor communities better. Also to support some non-profit research initiatives. I think the site provides a simple way to see patterns, track engagement, or discover new potential supporters.

Everyone here knows the benefit of a personal site. I want to make a directory of these online that's easy to use. This project started because I kept telling my friends, “You should really have a personal website!”

Like many of you, I believe everyone should have their own spot on the Internet that you own. Something different than just X or LinkedIn or Instagram. You want a simple place to put your best ideas, your projects, maybe some photos, your contact info, and the things you’re proud of.

A personal website helps you look great online. It gives you more control over what Google and ChatGPT say about you. And it creates serendipity. Your website is the easiest way to show up nicely online.

'''The End'''
That’s all for now! This is my first update to my /now page, so I hope that I’ll keep it up.
