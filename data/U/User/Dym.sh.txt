=== Website ===

Currently rebuilding and restructuring my website, with following plans:

* upload to server via [[Git]] (simultaneous mirroring)
* [[Markdown]] as main free-form content format
* [https://kdl.dev/ KDL] for per-project meta-info
* converting those, and/or list files in the directory
* generate [[The-Open-Graph-protocol|OGP]]-thumbnails
* serve everything as static files per [[SSR]]

supporting:
* [[RSS]] + [[sitemap|SiteMap]]
* [[JSON_Feed]] + [[GraphQL]]
* [[Gemini]] + <kbd>[Ctrl+F]</kbd>

semi-autonomous mode for:
* partial cross-posting to [[Twitter]], [[Reddit]], [[Instagram]]
* code-mirroring with [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]], and [[codepen|CodePen]] (when applicable)
* aggregating activities from those sites
