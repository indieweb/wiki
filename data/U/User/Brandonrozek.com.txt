== [https://brandonrozek.com Brandon Rozek] ==
Brandon Rozek is a computer scientist who is interested in the Indieweb [[Principles]]. In fact according to this page's history, he has been dabbling on and off with his website since 2015.

==Setup==
Brandon Rozek uses the [https://gohugo.io/ Hugo] static site generator to create his site with a [https://github.com/brandon-rozek/pulp/ modified] version of the [https://github.com/koirand/pulp/ Pulp] theme. In a past life, he used Wordpress and various plugins to implement IndieWeb Principles such as [[POSSE]] and [[PESOS]]. He wishes to slowly reimplement these methods and explore new ones in his current site.

His website currently supports:
* Microformats ([https://indieweb.org/h-card h-card], [https://indieweb.org/h-entry h-entry])
* [https://indieweb.org/rel-me rel-me]
* Manual [[Webmention]] Submission via Form on each post
* Automatic [[backfeed]] from Mastodon using [[Bridgy]]
* Displaying of Webmentions via [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js/ Webmention.js]

==Itches==

He's currently working on a way to present his toots from Mastodon on his webpage. You can checkout his current progress by seeing [https://brandonrozek.com/toots this page].
* Currently it's constructed by unioning previous API calls to the Mastodon API and having Hugo parse the JSON
* He is considering writing a Python script to create markdown files within Hugo that contains his toots. One benefit of this approach is that then an RSS feed can be generated as well.

He will also like to extend this technique to one day get off of Webmention.js and instead parse the [[webmention.io]] API during build time and bake it into the post.

==Legacy==
===Indieweb Setup===
Brandon Rozek uses [https://wordpress.org/ Wordpress] to power his site with a custom theme.

He implements [[PESOS]] by using the [http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/ Feedwordpress Plugin] to import content from [http://codepen.io/ Codepen] and his git mirror. He also PESOS his comments using [[Bridgy]]

Brandon implements [[POSSE]] by using Bridgy to send out a link to his blog posts on [[Twitter]]. He also sends a copy of his blog posts to his [[Tumblr]] ([https://wordpress.org/plugins/tumblr-crosspostr/ plugin]) and [[Medium]] ([https://wordpress.org/plugins/medium/ plugin]).

===Indieweb Projects===
*Brandon developed an [https://gist.github.com/brandonrozek/e0153b2733e947fa9c87 userscript] that parses the representative [[h-card]] of the page and displays a link to a vCard containing the information.

===Itches===
*Lowering the amount of Wordpress plugins he uses and making it instead into a script that checks his site periodically for updates.

*Finding a way to archive pages to reduce link rot and automatically displaying it on his site when sites go down. (Perhaps using the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/ Broken Link Checker plugin] and directing users to the archived page when the link is broken?)
** Check out the [[archival_copy#Owark|Owark Wordpress Plugin]] and see if it works for you - it automatically archives anything you link to in posts so you can switch to showing that archival copy if/when the links break. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]]
