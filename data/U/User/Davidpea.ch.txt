Hi there. My name is <span class="h-card">[[http://davidpea.ch David Peach]]</span> and I am a full-time web developer living in the Midlands in England.

I use WordPress for my personal website at [[http://davidpea.ch https://davidpea.ch]]. At the time of writing, this domain is brand new and my current posts are at [[https://davidpeach.co.uk https://davidpeach.co.uk]]. I will be moving these over with 301 redirects in due time. :)

I have been on and off the IndieWeb train for a while now, but it has been about a year since I seriously thought about it all.

Today, October 9th 2018, is the day when I am back on the Indieweb for good, and helping others to do the same.
