== Introduction ==

<p>
I&#8217;m a web developer during the day. I&#8217;ve been known to listen to music, take photographs, and read books. I <strong>love</strong> to hike and travel.
</p>

== My site ==

<p>
I wrote:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the little CMS that lets me administer my website</li>
<li>a location/checkin web app to help update my site with my current location</li>
<li>a small analytics script to help me understand my visitors and what they're interested in on my site</li>
<li>an API to pull my data from various sources, including my own website</li>
<li>a little bookmarklet to collect bookmarks to display on my site</li>
<li>a little bookmarklet to collect likes to display on my site</li>
<li>an iOS Shortcut to export that days steps to a database</li>
</ul>

<p>
Always tinkering.
</p>

== Itches ==

* Figure out a way to send proper reply webmentions, specifically adding mf2 in markdown editor
