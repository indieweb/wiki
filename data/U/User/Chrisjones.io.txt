== Introduction ==

<p>
I&#8217;m a <a title="I'm a web developer" rel="me" href="https://resume.chrisjones.io/" class="p-job-title">web developer</a>
during the day. I&#8217;ve been known to <a href="/tracks/" title="My tracks">listen to music</a>,
<a title="photographs" href="/photographs/">take photographs</a>, and
<a title="My catalog on Goodreads" rel="me" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37574941-chris-jones">read books</a>.
I <strong>love</strong> <a href="/articles/tag/hiking/" title="All hiking related writing posts">to hike</a> and
<a href="/articles/tag/travel/" title="All travel related writing posts">travel</a>.

== My site ==

<p>
I wrote the little CMS that lets me administer my website. I wrote a location/checkin web app to help update my site with my current location. I wrote a small stats package to help me understand my visitors and what they're interested in on my site. I wrote a little <em>currently playing</em> script to pull what I'm listening to on Last.fm and display it on my website. I wrote an API to pull my data from various sources, including my website. I wrote a little bookmarking bookmarklet to collect bookmarks to display on my site.
</p>

<p>
Always tinkering.
