== Introduction ==

<p>
I&#8217;m a web developer/administrator during the day. I&#8217;ve been known to listen to music, take photographs, and read books. I <strong>love</strong> to hike and travel.
</p>

== My site ==

<p>
I wrote:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the CMS that lets me maintain my website</li>
<li>an API to pull my data from various sources, including my own website</li>
<li>a little bookmarklet to collect likes to display on my site</li>
<li>a location/checkin Progressive Web App (PWA) to help update my site with my current location</li>
<li>a simple file-sharing Progressive Web App (PWA) to help get files/images from anywhere</li>
</ul>

<p>
Always tinkering.
</p>

== Itches ==

* Figure out a way to send proper reply webmentions, specifically adding mf2 in markdown editor
* Writing/posting more than just every couple of weeks
