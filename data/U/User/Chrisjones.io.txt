== Introduction ==

<p>
I&#8217;m a web developer during the day. I&#8217;ve been known to listen to music, take photographs, and read books. I <strong>love</strong> to hike and travel.
</p>

== My site ==

<p>
I wrote the little CMS that lets me administer my website. I wrote a location/checkin web app to help update my site with my current location. I wrote a small stats package to help me understand my visitors and what they're interested in on my site. I wrote a little <em>currently playing</em> script to pull what I'm listening to on Last.fm and display it on my website. I wrote an API to pull my data from various sources, including my website. I wrote a little bookmarking bookmarklet to collect bookmarks to display on my site.
</p>

<p>
Always tinkering.
</p>

== Itches ==

* Learn Swift and write an iOS music app to scrobble tracks to an HTTP endpoint
* Writing/posting more than just every couple of weeks
