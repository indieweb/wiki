Rebooted the blog in March 2016 with the intent of owning everything I do on the web.

Long form, microblog and microcast are all hosted locally with the microcast registered in iTunes. All posts are syndicated to [http://micro.blog micro.blog] and I quit both Facebook and Twitter.

Embracing the Indieweb via WordPress plugins and manually added microformats2 markup.
