== Itches ==
* Use Micro.blog.
* I'm not a web developer, I don't want to be.
* But I want to learn how to selfdogfood eventually.
* I prefer front-end anyway. But I'm still lazy sadly.
* I'm disabled (C-PTSD), and need to find what works for me, even if I can't make it myself.
* Find my sources and collaborate, well-adjusted people don't bite after all.
