Hi, I'm {{jamietanna}}, I'm a passionate part of the IndieWeb - I post on my website, https://www.jvt.me and have spoken at meetups and conferences about the IndieWeb.

I previously ran Homebrew Website Club in Nottingham, but since ~2021, I have not run the event.

I still feel part of the IndieWeb, but in recent years have not been able to focus on it as heavily as I did in the past, due to a whole host of other [[life_happens]] and [https://www.jvt.me/open-source/ Open Source projects I maintain]
