Hi, I'm {{jamietanna}} and I'm a big fan of getting stuck into the IndieWeb - I post on my website, [https://www.jvt.me] and am getting started on my journey!

== Itches ==

* Syndicate RSVPs from site to [[Meetup.com]] / backfill from Meetup.com to site
* Microsub for [[Meetup.com]]
* IndieAuth server that can use a simple OTP/passwordless setup ie for use on others' machines
* "Serverless" URL shortener

== Posts ==

I've written a few posts about the Indieweb, most easily referenced at https://www.jvt.me/tags/indieweb, as well as announcing changes to my site on https://www.jvt.me/tags/www.jvt.me
