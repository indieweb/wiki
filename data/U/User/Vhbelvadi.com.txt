Venkatram Harish Belvadi studies the history and philosophy of science and the interconnections between science, technology and society. He has been running his personal website [https://vhbelvadi.com VHBelvadi.com] since 2007.

== Websites ==
I used to run a [[multi-site_indieweb|multi-site set-up]] split by content but since 2024 have combined everything into my [https://vhbelvadi.com main website]. The website is powered by Statamic and includes the following:

* [https://vhbelvadi.com/essays Essays]
* [https://vhbelvadi.com/bookshelf Book reviews] (with a separate [https://vhbelvadi.com/reading-list Reading list])
* [https://vhbelvadi.com/photography Photography]
* [https://vhbelvadi.com/notes Marginalia]

== Newsletter ==

=== First edition ===
Since 2009 to 2022 I ran my newsletter, untitled, which recommended interesting things to read, listen to and watch every week. It grew pretty popular and had no niche but by 2023 I retired it in favour of curating a new newsletter based on a different concept and a well-defined niche. This newsletter used to run on MailChimp.

=== Second edition: Confluence ===
Briefly known as Dispatch from Rhûn, [https://vhbelvadi.com/newsletter Confluence] focuses on my primary interests, allowing me to be more productive with my writing each issue and benefitting me in multiple ways as part of my primary work studying the history and philosophy of science.

Confluence focusses on the interconnections between science, technology and society drawing from historic and philosophical perspectives while also addressing current and developing issues in our everyday use of science and technology—the same issues that form the focus of my essays. Since the two editions of the newsletter have varied themes, the readership of the first edition was not carried forward and subscribers were given the opportunity to remain subscribed if they chose to, respecting their time and allowing them to reconsider their subscription under newer terms. This newsletter runs on Buttondown.
