Currently working on a blogging engine with MicroPub support and other IndieWeb related features, nearly ready for a beta release. See [[microlight]] (or [https://github.com/TomboFry/microlight via GitHub]) for more information. With it, I intend to track my daily life - everything I listen to, eat, drink, bike rides, films, like on YouTube, purchases - and take pride in the fact that I own all of that data, as opposed to some external organisation.
