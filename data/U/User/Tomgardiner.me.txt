Working on a blogging engine with MicroPub and webmention support (and other IndieWeb related features), having recently released version 1.0.0. See [[microlight]] (or [https://github.com/TomboFry/microlight via GitHub]) for more information. With it, I intend to track my daily life - everything I listen to, eat, drink, bike rides, films, like on YouTube, purchases - and take pride in the fact that I own all of that data, as opposed to some external organisation.

It has passed all of the tests on [https://micropub.rocks/implementation-reports/servers/372/mJfD7vlJWF1pG95AIBTy micropub.rocks], and I do intend on proudly [[selfdogfooding]] microlight.
