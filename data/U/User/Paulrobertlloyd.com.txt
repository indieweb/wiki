* '''My website''', built using [[Eleventy]] is where I publish [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/articles/ articles], [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/notes/ notes], [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/photos/ photos] and [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/bookmarks/ bookmarks]. Iâ€™ve also added [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/events/ events] and [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/trips/ trips], but not entirely sure how these should work yet.

* '''[[Indiekit]]''', is a Micropub and IndieAuth server, designed from the outset to be highly customisable and extensible.
