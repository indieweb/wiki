== IndieWeb projects ==

* '''My website''', built using [[Eleventy]] and where I publish [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/articles/ articles], [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/notes/ notes], [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/photos/ photos] and [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/bookmarks/ bookmarks]. Iâ€™m also adding [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/events/ events] and [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/trips/ trips], but not entirely sure how these should work yet.

* '''[[Indiekit]]''', a nascent Micropub server and work in progress. I hope to support more protocols and features over time.

* '''[https://github.com/getindiekit/mf2tojf2 mf2tojf2]''', a JavaScript port of [https://github.com/microformats/mf2tojf2.py mf2tojf2.py].
