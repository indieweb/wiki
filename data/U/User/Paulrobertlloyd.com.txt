== IndieWeb projects ==

* '''My website''', built using [[Eleventy]] is where I publish [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/articles/ articles], [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/notes/ notes], [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/photos/ photos] and [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/bookmarks/ bookmarks]. Iâ€™m also investigating adding support for [https://paulrobertlloyd.com/events/ events], but not entirely sure how these should work yet.

* '''[[IndieKit]]''' is my nascent Micropub server, a work in progress, with longer term ambitions to support more protocols and features.
