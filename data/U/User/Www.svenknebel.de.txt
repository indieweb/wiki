http://www.svenknebel.de since 2016-04-12 runs a still nameless custom python/flask app, reading HTML-formatted posts with YAML-headers from flat files. 

== Working as of 2017-05-20 ==
* posts with HTML content and associated static files (primarily images)
* posts are in categories
* sending and receiving webmentions for posts and homepage
* micropub for creating and editing posts
** reply/bookmark/like relations created via micropub
* other things (e.g. bridgy publish, rsvps) require me to manually put the necessary markup in the HTML content
** I generally POSSE manually (and generally don't do it very often) and edit in the syndication links for backfeed

== short-term itches ==
* Write a posting interface or micropub client. Hoped to avoid this, but posting to my site right now just isn't working using the stuff I've tried
** support editing
** content on *all* post types, both HTML and not

* non-HTML content format (plumbing exists, have to decide on a format and wire it in)
* file-uploads
* establish post types (bookmarks, quotes, ...)
* working on own IndieAuth endpoint
* better design for text-heavy posts -> right now to squished
* RSS/Atom feed

== mid-term itches ==
* improved webmention handling (display comments, properly handle edits, better verification code)
* plumbing: caching, better background processing
* [[photo metadata]] markup/handling
*  private webmention alternatives, [[non-interactive IndieAuth]], easier login using [[IndieActions]] or similar
* workflow to add syndication links
* work on [[Kaja]]
* POSSE to Wiki for events

== long-term Itches/random ideas ==
* investigate autocomplete, custom fields, ... for micropub

* CSS posts that show up as styling options

* I would like for a Client-side JS static site generator to exist, to get around the "have to install strange stuff" problem for non-programmers. Not sure if I personally would use it though... 
** There is increasing related acitivity under the label [Jamstack https://jamstack.org/] [https://cosmicjs.com/blog/how-to-build-a-jamstack-website good intro at beginning], but right now still quite API-dependent 

* <del>a very basic little password/TOTP auth endpoint as a single php file or so might be a neat thing to build</del> I haven't contributed yet, but [[selfauth]] is a thing now

* round-trip testing tool for Webmentions&display, maybe also MP?
** send WM from randomly created post to dedicated test-post, parse comment display (or other channel for people without display) for content.
** have external verifyability somehow
** update only? or test creating of new ones?
** re-run webmention.rocks (or equivalent) tests somehow

== general inbox ==
* <Zegnat> sknebel, can I file a feature request? ;) author parsing on h-feed (about the authorship thingy)
