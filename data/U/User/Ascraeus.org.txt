Nickname on irc/slack: dgold


== My Indieweb Setup ==
* '''Main''' Site using [[hugo]] - [https://ascraeus.org ascraeus.org]
** Fully marked up h-card and h-entry
** Hugo Theme available [https://github.com/dg01d/reproach on GitHub] (Note: Heavily customised)
** Using [http://webmention.io wm.io] as webmention endpoint
** Using [[Morris]] to store webmentions locally
** Backfeed with Brid.gy
** Media Endpoint up and running!

* '''Microsub''' Server - [https://greyarea.ascraeus.org greyarea]
** Using {{aaronpk}}'s [[Aperture]]
** Companion site [https://perfidy.ascraeus.org perfidy] runs [[Watchtower]]
** Detailed set up of these in two posts on my blog: [https://ascraeus.org/websub-part-i-watchtower/ Watchtower] | [https://ascraeus.org/websub-part-ii-aperture/ Aperture]

* '''Micropub''' Client - [https://hylozoist.ascraeus.org hylozoist]
** Patched version of [[Quill]]
** Allows me to post book reviews to my site.
** Doesn't actually write the reviews, unfortunately.

* '''Git''' Server - [https://ringdown.ascraeus.org ringdown]
** Using [[Gitea]] and putting all personal github repos on it.
** Using [[indieauth]] as OpenID server to login.

* '''Matrix''' Server - [https://heavymessing.ascraeus.org heavymessing]
** My personal homeserver for the [Matrix] chat protocol
** Not really "indie" as such, but certainly an interesting exercise in federation.

* All sites are encrypted using [[LetsEncrypt]] 
* Using [[nginx]] for all sites, wrote about a privacy-aware nginx setup [https://ascraeus.org/page/privacy/ on my blog's privacy policy]

==nanopub==

Micropub endpoint for static site generators, written in PHP.

* Currently handles the following indieweb post-types:
** Notes
** Like-of
** Reply-to
** Articles
** Replies
** Bookmarks
** Check-Ins

* Supports header and form parameter methods of authentication
* Supports creating posts using `x-www-form-urlencoded` syntax
* Supports updating and deleting posts
* Supports JSON syntax and source content query
* Supports replacement and deletion of properties
* As it uses a separate Media Endpoint it provides configuration query

More details on the [[nanopub]] page

All code [https://github.com/dg01d/nanopub is on GitHub]

==Itches==

* Would like to automatically ''send'' webmentions on posting new content

==Naming==

* I tend to name my sites after ship names in the Iain M. Banks [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series Culture Series].
