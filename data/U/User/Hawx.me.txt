Hi, I'm Josh and have been interested in the indieweb stuff for a while.

== Working On ==
* [https://github.com/hawx/relme-auth relme-auth], an [[IndieAuth]] server that uses [[RelMeAuth]] to authenticate. An instance is running at [https://auth.hawx.me/ https://auth.hawx.me/].
* [https://github.com/hawx/tally-ho tally-ho], my blog software that does [[Micropub]] (with syndication to Twitter and Flickr), [[Webmentions]] (sending and receiving) and [[WebSub]] (kind of). See [https://me.hawx.me/ https://me.hawx.me/].
* [https://github.com/hawx/riviera riviera] + [https://github.com/hawx/rivelin rivelin] feed aggregator that uses the [http://riverjs.org/ riverjs] format.
* [https://github.com/hawx/arboretum arboretum] another feed aggregator that attempts to replicate the [[fraidycat]] viewing experience.
