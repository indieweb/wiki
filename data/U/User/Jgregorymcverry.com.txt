=== Still to Accomplish (as in requires other people) ===
* Micropub badge maker
* Chat solution
** I am currently using minnit.chat, and embedding it as an iframe
** I used Slack, nobody chats. Need to scaffold in this behaviour rather than expect.
** Want a chat or fast syndication of notes and replies solution.
* Student blogging platform, Used Wordpress.com at a free level. Need to go ad-free to protect privacy. Might make them pay $4. Hard to ask hungry people to pay for domains.
** WordPress (self-hosted) IndieWeb worked for my advanced technologies class but not possible for first-year students
** Investigate microblog
** Investigate blogging directly from Glitch.
** Examine changes in HTML properties from parsed websites to test growth curve models
** Examine growth curves to determine effective bot triggers
** Write bot scripts
* Microformats Citation generator
** Working with {{zegnat}} and {{cjwillcock}} to build APA microformats machine
** Build the HTML input fields for each APA citation type
** map microformats on to APA citation styles
** Handoff to {{zegnat}} to make magic happen

This is the story and canonical domain to follow updates on my microformats2 course templates [http://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/05/14/designing-an-indieweb-course-template]

Thinking if a UI could then be built to populate the templates: [https://jgregorymcverry.com/can-we-build-a-static-site-generator-for-indieweb/]
