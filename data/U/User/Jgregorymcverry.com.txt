possible article stub for theme developer guide:

<ol>
	<li>Run the theme and post through indiewebify.me</li>
	<li>Remove any old microformats if they are found (will look for better documentation on this)</li>
	<li>Add micoformats2 (hence known as just microformats buts its important to make sure you are on the right wiki)</li>
<ol>
<li>Begin with the h-card. The IndieWeb plugin handles this by adding rel=me links in the profile and adding an h-card widget. You can just fold these into the theme or add an h-card to the header or footer.</li>
<li>Then you can look to h-entry. You can start with just your post and page types. You could stop there and be done</li>
<li>If you wanted to add all the #IndieWeb Post Types (hence known as post-kinds to avoid confusion) look at the post-kind page on the indieweborg wiki</li>
<li>The Post-Kind Plug in adds these, but it would be better to fold this plug in into your theme. I do not know why the custom post types aren't used <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org">https://codex.wordpress.org</a>/Post_Types but I would ask <a class="h-card u-url p-name" href="https://notiz.blog/">Matthias Pfefferle</a> and <a class="h-card u-url p-name" href="https://david.shanske.com/">David Shanske</a> 
</ol>
<li>Add a notification to add the following plug-ins. There are more but these will get your users started.</li>
<ul>
<li>semantic linkbacks</li>
<li>Bridgy</li>
<li>webmentions</li>
<li>micropub...technically not required but publishing with third party clients is awesome</li>
<li>IndieAuth</li>
<li>Indieweb... if you didn't do rel="me" and h-card in your theme...do it in your theme</li>
<li>Post-Kinds...if you didn't do it in your theme...do it in your theme</li>
<ul>
<li>There might be some UI changes that I don't have a clue about. Better question for David or Mathais</li>
<li>Remember keeping things as basic HTML as possible is a major design consideration of the #IndieWeb. Plus it helps out the microformats parsers</li>
<li>Go to indiewebify.me again try again. Hopefully all passes.</li>
<li>Go to webmentions.rock and test all the validators. Hopefully you will pass</li>
</ul>
