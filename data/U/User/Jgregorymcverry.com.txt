Headless IndieWeb LMS

A video walkthrough of my sketches of what I ultimately want with all the pieces I have no idea how to build. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkJbqfV0P18]

This is the story and canonical domain to follow updates on my microformats2 course templates [http://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/05/14/designing-an-indieweb-course-template]

Thinking if a UI could then be built to populate the templates: [https://jgregorymcverry.com/can-we-build-a-static-site-generator-for-indieweb/]

What if there was an h root for courses? [http://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/05/07/microformats-i-would-like-in-remixable-indieweb-classrooms]
