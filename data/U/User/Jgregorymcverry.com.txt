=== Brainstorming ===
* Micropub badge maker
** Received grant. Currently, working on this in conjunction with ReVIEW Talent feedback System
** Will use the Kirby CMS
** Not using Kirby building webmnetion badges in Known CMS
* chatroom for classroom websites
** I am currently using minnit.chat, and embedding it as an iframe
** I used Slack, nobody chats. Need to scaffold in this behavior rather than expect.
** May move to Microsoft Teams as provided by University
** Want a chat or fast syndication of notes and replies solution.
* Student blogging platform, Used Wordpress.com at a free level. Need to go ad-free to protect privacy. Might make them pay $4. Hard to ask hungry people to pay for domains.
** WordPress (self-hosted) IndieWeb worked for my advanced technologies class but not possible for first-year students
** went back to allowing a blogging platform of choice or using LMS "blogs"
** For edtech class they will build sites on glitch, may go back to a multi user Known instance
** Examine changes in HTML properties from parsed websites to test growth curve models
** Develop assistive bots
* Microformats Citation generator
** Working with {{zegnat}} and {{cjwillcock}} to build APA microformats machine
** Build the HTML input fields for each APA citation type
** map microformats on to APA citation styles
** Handoff to {{zegnat}} to make magic happen
