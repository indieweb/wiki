Hello. I'm Jeremy and I have been online a long, long time. In all that time, though, I have never really understood the machinery that makes everything work. I don't think I ever will.

I'm very attracted to the ideas and philosophy of indieweb and POSSE, and started experimenting a long while back on [http://vaviblog.com Another Site]. That worked well enough, but I didn't have the kind of access to break it that I really wanted, so I recently installed Known under my main site.

That site is built with [[Grav]], with a sidebar that uses a plugin to pull in streams from an instance of Known that runs under a [https://stream.jeremycherfas.net subdomain] and a stream from [https://www.reading.am/everybody Reading.am], see [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/reading-coding-and-commenting Reading, coding and commenting] and [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/using-reading-am-with-grav Using Reading.am with Grav]

==Multi-site IndieWeb==

At the moment I have project-specific sites running under WordPress ([http://www.fornacalia.com fornacalia] for bread making, [http://eatthispodcast.com Eat This Podcast] for podcasting, and the [http://agro.biodiver.se Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog], a kind of news-aggregator where a colleague now provides most of the content and I manage the site). 

Eat This Podcast is now pretty much Indieweb enabled, receiving reactions from Twitter and via webmentions, thanks to the plugin authors and my child of the [https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher/ Independent Publisher theme]. Fornacalia is partially IndieWeb enabled but Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog is not.

All this is historical and predates me learning about IndieWeb, and [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-1 I am still not sure how best to integrate everything], or even whether that would be worthwhile, but [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-2 I am slowly getting there].

My most rewarding social interactions take place on [[10Centuries]]

==Itches==
* The Big Itch: bring some order to my online life (to be expanded)
* Owning bookmarks and their content. I currently use both Instapaper and Pinboard. I can download everything from Pinboard, but what then?
* :<s>Looking at [http://wallabag.org/ Wallabag] for bookmarks, but may prefer to POSSE to Pinboard.</s>
* : Study micropub to create posts on Known from RSS of links at Reading.am
* A podcast: [[Indieweb Podcast Club | Ask the IndieWeb about the IndieWeb]]

==Working On==
* Ensure Known, Quill and Twitter work well together for me.
* Added [http://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention receiver] from {{voxpelli}} and got it working in two short sessions.
:Still need to work a bit more on styling.
* Added form to submit mentions from elsewhere.
:Would like to make this a more useful plugin.
:Would like to display ''In reply to'' etc. if appropriate.
