Hello. I'm Jeremy and I have been online a long, long time. In all that time, though, I have never really understood the machinery that makes everything work. I don't think I ever will.

I'm very attracted to the ideas and philosophy of indieweb and POSSE, and started experimenting a long while back on [http://vaviblog.com Another Site]. That worked well enough, but I didn't have the kind of access to break it that I really wanted, so I installed [[Known]] under my main site.

That site is built with [[Grav]], with a sidebar that uses a plugin to pull in a stream from an instance of Known that runs under a [https://stream.jeremycherfas.net subdomain] and other bits and pieces.

==Multi-site IndieWeb==

At the moment I have project-specific sites running under ClassicPress ([http://eatthispodcast.com Eat This Podcast] for podcasting) and WordPress ([http://www.fornacalia.com fornacalia] for bread making), as well as the [http://agro.biodiver.se Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog], a kind of news-aggregator where a colleague now provides most of the content and I manage the site. 

Eat This Podcast uses a custom theme I created and is now pretty much Indieweb enabled, receiving reactions via webmentions, thanks to the plugin authors. Fornacalia is partially IndieWeb enabled but Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog is not.

All this is historical and predates me learning about IndieWeb, and [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-1 I am still not sure how best to integrate everything], or even whether that would be worthwhile, but [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-2 I am slowly getting there].

I also [[POSSE]] selectively to micro.blog. I do not currently POSSE to [https://indieweb.social/@etp Mastodon] although I do share links to some of my posts there.
