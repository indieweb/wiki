Hello. I'm Jeremy and I have been online a long, long time. In all that time, though, I have never really understood the machinery that makes everything work. I don't think I ever will.

I'm very attracted to the ideas and philosophy of indieweb and POSSE, and started experimenting a long while back on [http://vaviblog.com Another Site]. That worked well enough, but I didn't have the kind of access to break it that I really wanted, so I recently installed Known under my main site.

That site is built with [[Grav]], with a sidebar that uses a plugin to pull in a stream from an instance of Known that runs under a [https://stream.jeremycherfas.net subdomain] and other bits and pieces.

==Multi-site IndieWeb==

At the moment I have project-specific sites running under WordPress ([http://www.fornacalia.com fornacalia] for bread making, [http://eatthispodcast.com Eat This Podcast] for podcasting, and the [http://agro.biodiver.se Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog], a kind of news-aggregator where a colleague now provides most of the content and I manage the site). 

Eat This Podcast is now pretty much Indieweb enabled, receiving reactions via webmentions, thanks to the plugin authors and my child of the [https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher/ Independent Publisher theme]. Fornacalia is partially IndieWeb enabled but Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog is not.

All this is historical and predates me learning about IndieWeb, and [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-1 I am still not sure how best to integrate everything], or even whether that would be worthwhile, but [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-2 I am slowly getting there].

I also [[POSSE]] selectively to micro.blog.
