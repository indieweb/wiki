Hello. I'm Jeremy and I have been online a long, long time. In all that time, though, I have never really understood the machinery that makes everything work. I don't think I ever will.

I'm very attracted to the ideas and philosophy of indieweb and POSSE, and started experimenting a long while back on [http://vaviblog.com Another Site]. That worked well enough, but I didn't have the kind of access to break it that I really wanted, so I recently installed Known under my main site.

That site is built with [[Grav]], with a sidebar that uses a plugin to pull in streams from an instance of Known that runs under a [https://stream.jeremycherfas.net subdomain] and a stream from [https://www.reading.am/everybody Reading.am], see [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/reading-coding-and-commenting Reading, coding and commenting] and [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/using-reading-am-with-grav Using Reading.am with Grav].
:More recently I have moved stopped using reading.am as frequently because it doesn't actually store what I need effectively. This is something to work on.

==Multi-site IndieWeb==

At the moment I have project-specific sites running under WordPress ([http://www.fornacalia.com fornacalia] for bread making, [http://eatthispodcast.com Eat This Podcast] for podcasting, and the [http://agro.biodiver.se Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog], a kind of news-aggregator where a colleague now provides most of the content and I manage the site). 

Eat This Podcast is now pretty much Indieweb enabled, receiving reactions from Twitter and via webmentions, thanks to the plugin authors and my child of the [https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher/ Independent Publisher theme]. Fornacalia is partially IndieWeb enabled but Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog is not.

All this is historical and predates me learning about IndieWeb, and [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-1 I am still not sure how best to integrate everything], or even whether that would be worthwhile, but [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-2 I am slowly getting there].

My most rewarding social interactions take place on [[10Centuries]].

==Itches==
* The Big Itch: bring some order to my online life (to be expanded)
* Correct mf2 markup on book reviews
* Owning bookmarks and their content. I currently use both Instapaper and Pinboard. I can download everything from Pinboard, but what then?
* Work with [https://readpaperback.com/about Paperback] and the [https://pinboard.in/api Pinboard API] to see whether I can bring reading notes to my site more easily
* Geodata
** Build page in Grav to show data from Compass.

==Working On==

==Done==
* Install Compass and Overland
* Automate podcast listens [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/automating-listen-posts with Applescript]
* Add [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/stream podcast listens] from [[Overcast]].
* Add [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/what-ive-watched page for media consumption] log.
* Add [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/sparklines-improved sparklines] for spam received and deleted.
* Ensure Known, Quill and Twitter work well together for me.
* Added [http://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention receiver] from {{voxpelli}} and got it working in two short sessions.
:<s>Still need to work a bit more on styling.</s>

:<s>Would like to make this a more useful plugin.</s>
:<s>Would like to display ''In reply to'' etc. if appropriate.</s>
