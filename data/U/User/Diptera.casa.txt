== About me ==
Hello I am Jo and I have a personal domain that can be reached via the [[HTTPS|http(s)]], [[Gopher | gopher]], [[Gemini|gemini]] and finger protocols. I work in [[design]] and anything web-technology and programming related I do is mostly a hobby of mine. I have been self hosting since about April 2022

== Elsewhere online ==
=== Shared UNIX systems ===
I have accounts on the following pubnixes:

* [https://tilda.tilde.team Tilde Team]
* [https://cosmic.voyage Cosmic Voyage]
* [http://marzanna.sdf.org SDF]
* [https://tilde.town/~isthereintruthnobeauty Tilde Town]

I don't really make use of their webhosting since I got my own domain. Maybe some day I will.

=== Public domain contributions ===
I have an account on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Brachycera Wikipedia], the [https://archive.org/details/@senor105 Internet Archive] and [https://librivox.org/reader/18393?primary_key=18393&search_category=reader&search_page=1&search_form=get_results LibriVox] but I am probably not very active.
