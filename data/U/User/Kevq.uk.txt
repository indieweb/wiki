My name is Kev Quirk and I have been blogging on various website since 2012. These days I only blog on my personal site, https://kevq.uk.

I'm fairly new to the whole concept of the IndieWeb, having first heard about it in early 2019. I've since taken steps to implement Indie features to my website wherever I can.

== My site ==
I'm using WordPress on my site with a custom theme. So far I've been able to implement Webmention, a h-card and IndieAuth.

Here is a post about my implementation as of April 2020: **link coming soon**

== Interests ==

I am interested in:

* Open source software
* Online privacy
* Cyber security
* Web design
* Motorcycles
* Aquariums and fishkeeping
* Dogs! I love dogs!
