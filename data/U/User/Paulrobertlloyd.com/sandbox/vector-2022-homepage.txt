== What is the IndieWeb? ==
<span class="p-summary">The <a class="u-url p-name" href="/IndieWeb"><dfn style="font-style: normal">IndieWeb</dfn></a> is a people-focused alternative to the “corporate web”.</span>

'''It is a [[people|community]] of independent and personal websites''' connected by [[building blocks|open standards]] and based on the [[principles]] of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content.

=== Your content is yours ===
[[File:homepage-content.svg|72px|frameless|left|alt=Heart Icon|class=iwc-homepage__icon]]
When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and [[site-deaths|lost all of their users’ data]]. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.

=== You are better connected ===
[[File:homepage-connected.svg|frameless|72px|left|alt=Connected network icon|class=iwc-homepage__icon]]
Your articles and status messages can [[POSSE|go to all services]], not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Even replies and likes on other services can [[backfeed|come back to your site]] so they’re all in one place.
{{clear}}

=== You are in control ===
[[File:homepage-control.svg|72px|frameless|left|alt=Steering wheel icon|class=iwc-homepage__icon]]
You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as ''example.com/ideas''. These links are [[permalinks|permanent]] and will always work.

== Beyond Blogging and Decentralization ==
The IndieWeb effort is [[different]] from previous efforts/communities:
* '''[[Principles]]''' over project-centrism. Others assume a [[monoculture]] of one project for all. We are developing a [[principles#Plurality|plurality of projects]]. The IndieWeb community has a [[code-of-conduct]]. 
* '''[[use what you make|Publish on your site]]'''. Show before tell. Prioritize by [[make what you need|making what you need]], [[create|creating]], iterating on your site.
* '''[[Design]]''' first, protocols and formats second. Focus on creating a good user experience and [[use what you make|using your own prototype features]] to focus on minimum necessary [[formats]] and [[protocols]].
Perhaps most importantly, we are people-focused instead of project-focused. We have [https://events.indieweb.org/ regular meetups]. All are welcome. You don't need to have a website to join, but you should be interested in personal websites!
