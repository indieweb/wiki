Hello from Vancouver, Canada! 

I was introduced to IndieWeb by {{chrisaldrich}}. I then started corralling siloed content into [https://itheorist.com/ itheorist.com].

== Working on ==
See my [https://itheorist.com/wip WIP].

== Itches ==
* Work on expanding my h-card
* Continue IndieWebifying my site
* Figure out how to best leverage location data in various post kinds
* The '[[note]]' post kind is not displaying the corresponding icon.
* <s>The '[[note]]' post kind does not have response options by default, nor does it work if one enables them manually via Screen Options on WP. I often write notes off of URLs... (unless this is the definition of '[[read]]' post kind.)</s>
* <s>Reposts with written content and excerpt retweet without the content, but they should include it ==> quotes.</s>
* For post kind [[issue]], Brid.gy issues the following error, which shouldn't be the case: '''Bridgy Error: Could not find a tweet to reply to.'''
* For some time now, I keep getting the "Error establishing connection to database" issue, almost always some PHP fatal error related to one of the Indieweb plugins. Restarting the database service resolves the issue, but I wonder if anybody else has been getting the error (apache, aws, mysql).
