I’m Adpocalyptic (''<u>The One & Only</u>'') also known as ''Ad. (But used to be called Dasein)'' I’m just some random neurodivergent guy on the internet (also one with OCD) who likes yelling beans, likes joking that i’m from Cheltnahm, and likes to push buttons whilst seeing what happens but unfortunately that leads to breaking a lot of things (Many apologies in advance), but I primarily have my more 'niche' areas of interests within the topics of history, philosophy, psychiatry, pharmacology, politics, and economics, which is where I'll likely be most active (even if wish I could be more active) as I learn more about properly using Wiki's/Wikia's. Which I'd sincerely appreciate understanding on, as I might not technically have just popped up today <u>'''but'''</u> I would still hope people understand that I am not experienced enough to have a clue.

This is my main page with an ‘about me’ but you can access my ‘talk page’ from here where you can leave a message to notify me so I’d hopefully get back to you for discussions later & try help resolve any issues. (Life is chaotic so that might be slow) I try not to have issues occur in the first place but I’ve often found that’s not how my life works.
