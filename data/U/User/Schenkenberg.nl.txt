This is the user page for Tom Schenkenberg. I'm a personal technology enthusiast and co-founder of Ibuildings, a web application software development company in the Netherlands. I'm a huge fan of open standards and open source software. Frankly, I owe my career to free software and the principle behind its communities.

I'm building a personal website on which I'll be publishing my own content. Thank you IndieWeb!
