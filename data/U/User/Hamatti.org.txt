Juhis is a community builder, blogger and public speaker who writes about technology, communities, events and life at https://hamatti.org.

Originally from Finland, adventures have taken him to do projects and work in Shanghai, San Francisco and Berlin. All those adventures have had an impact on his view of the world and creativity.

Juhis advocates for open web where information is shared openly on platforms that don't require specific memberships or accounts.

In his daily life, he runs developer communities for [https://turkufrontend.fi frontend] and [https://archipylago.dev Python] developers.

His main website is https://hamatti.org which is built with [https://11ty.dev Eleventy] and has RSS feed, a blog roll and possibly working Webmentions.

Some future projects are to add support for microformats and improved pages for feeds.
