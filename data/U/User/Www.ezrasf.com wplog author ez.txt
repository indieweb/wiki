== My IndieWeb Setup ==
https://www.ezrasf.com/ is my long running blog from 2000 where I post techie related content. Currently it is a self-hosted Wordpress. Sometimes work-related. Sometimes political. Mostly dead-ish of late, but I am considering blogging more through it again. I've archived older blogs from platforms that died here such as Friendsters, LiveJournal, MoveableType, Pitas, Vox, and Xanga.

==Todo==
Look into exporting Blogger and import into Wordpress.
