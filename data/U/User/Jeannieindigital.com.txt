Jeannie is a 20+ year corporate veteran. Jeannie's first position was with a company that built satellite telemetry and data acquisition systems for NASA.  She spent the formative years of her corporate career working for a prominent global ISP and web host from the mid-90's to the early-00's which shaped her passion for technology and the internet. She spent several years in the financial industry in the late 00's and early 10's. Her final position was in the operations division of a technology company that manages state-run online charter schools.

Jeannie changed careers to full-time caregiver with the birth of her son in 2015.  She has two children (born 1996 and 2015) and one grandchild (born 2015). Her husband, son, and she reside in Baltimore, MD, USA.
