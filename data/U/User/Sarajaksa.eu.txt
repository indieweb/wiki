I have started a website based on a conversation in the Le Petit Cafe one day after a Toastmasters meeting. Since I was never a fan of most social media, this has generally be my most active internet presence I ever had. 

I count my attendance at the Düsseldorf IndieWeb camp as my entry to the IndieWeb.

== My IndieWeb Projects ==

=== Movie Project ===

I got inspired by {{benji}}'s idea to create the [https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/ movie overview page]. I periodically scrape the sites of people that gave me permission for this. And then I show the overview of all the movies these people posted that they have watched on their site. 

=== AO3 RSS Feed ===

[https://indieweb.org/User:Alexsirac.com Alex] had once asked me, if it would be possible to do automatic the posting of AO3 comments on the personal site. I am still working on this. Very Slowly, but I did not give up yet. :)

In doing this, I now have the API endpoint, which can aggregate the public stories for any connection of tags. And not just for the one tag at the time, as the AO3 supports from the box. You can do this by adding the AO3 link to nay page with works after https://api.sarajaksa.eu/ao3/rss/ . To subscribe to my stories, one would need to call https://api.sarajaksa.eu/ao3/rss/https://archiveofourown.org/users/sarajaksa/works .

=== Books metadata API ===

For my own purposes, I also provide the API endpoint, that check for the data on a couple of different places and return what they find. 

Currently one can search for covers based on either:
- ISBN or Cobiss ID: http://api.sarajaksa.eu/book/cover/978-4-08-882855-8
- book metadata based on the ISBN http://api.sarajaksa.eu/book/isbn/978-1-63632-040-3
- or book metadata based on the Cobiss URL http://api.sarajaksa.eu/book/cobiss/https://plus.cobiss.net/cobiss/si/sl/bib/134481155

Cobiss is the electronic system used by the libraries in Slovenian and a couple of other Balkan countries. If you are not from there, then just ignore that part of it. 

=== Sending Webmentions API ===

I used to send the webmentions manually by using the https://www.webmention.app/ . Since this one does not work anymore, I created a webpoint, that can also send the webmention. It can be called with the URL of the article like this http://api.sarajaksa.eu/webmention/send/https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/wordpress-zakaj-lahko-onesposobljenje-vseh-vticnikov-sesuje-celotno-stran/
