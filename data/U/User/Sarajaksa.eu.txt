I have started a website based on a conversation in the Le Petit Cafe one day after a Toastmasters meeting. Since I was never a fan of most social media, this has generally be my most active internet presence I ever had. 

I count my attendance at the Düsseldorf IndieWeb camp as my entry to the IndieWeb.

Content warning: scary (based on the discussion we hat at the IndieWeb Berlin 2024 :) )

== IndieWeb Things I Am Thinking Of ==

=== Collaborative Writing ===

Something that I am interested in exploring more.

=== The Environment Question of the Web ===

== IndieWeb Camps Projects ==

=== Berlin 2024 ===

* Did I creative writing experiment to check if anybody would be even willing to collaborate together. Some of it worked really well. The results can be found at [[User:Sarajaksa.eu/Berlin]]
* Edited 3 blog posts and almost wrote another one

=== Nuremberg 2023 ===

* Fix up yesterday’s session notes and added more notes and links for the write session
* Fixed some AO3 specific bugs in my fork of Granary
* Worked on an interactive story

=== Berlin 2022 ===

* Not done at the end: Adding list of people I have met at the events on the private pages of my website
* looked into font issues with different languages/writing systems

=== Düsseldorf 2022 ===

* now has an events page showing events RSVPed
* and a map of all future events
* javascript filter by city
* working on contrast with CSS

=== Düsseldorf 2021 ===

Didn't demo anything.

== Communication ==

I list all the ways you can contact me on my website, which is linked to on the side. I tend to have a bit slower answering time, but I try to answer everything. I am open to things from random chats, links that you think I would find interesting, flames, questions, discussion prompts and nay kind of help with either tech or non-tech (like help with brainstorming what to blog about or so forth).
