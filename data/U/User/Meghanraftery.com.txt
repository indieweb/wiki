'''[https://meghanraftery.com/ meghanraftery.com]''' is my personal site and creative home base.

I’m Meghan. I work across writing, strategy, and creative projects, usually at the intersection of clarity and care. I like making things that feel thoughtful, useful, and human, whether that’s a piece of writing, a project, or a collaboration.

My site is where I keep track of what I’m building, what I’m learning, and the projects that matter to me. Some things are polished. Others are in progress. I’m okay with that.

These range from creative work to strategic initiatives, often focused on storytelling, structure, and making complex things easier to understand.

== Writing ==
My writing tends to explore work, creativity, and how people actually experience the things we build.

== Notes ==
This site is intentionally simple. I update it as my work evolves, and I treat it as a long-term record rather than a highlight reel.
