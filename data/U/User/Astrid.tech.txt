I'm Astrid Yu, and I'm a CS student. My blog and portfolio website is https://astrid.tech.


Its tech stack is described on [https://astrid.tech/projects/astrid-tech this self-describing webpage]. In a nutshell:
* Statically-generated [[Gatsby]] frontend, hosted on [[GitHub Pages]]
* (WIP) Python/Django backend for comments and hopefully other goodies later on
