I'm {{plenglin}}, a CS student at Cal Poly. [https://astrid.tech astrid.tech] is my personal website. The contents of its [https://astrid.tech/projects/astrid-tech/ self-describing webpage], are mirrored here.

After having made a lot of personal projects, I realized that I had forgotten a ton of them, and there wasn't really a place to show them off. This website was made to solve that issue.

== Frontend ==

I use Gatsby to statically generate the website. However, [https://astrid.tech/blog/2020-12-20-adding-a-backend/#replacing-gatsby I am considering moving off of it to Next.js].

The static site is hosted via [https://github.com/plenglin/astrid.tech Github Pages] to statically host the website. (Going to [https://plenglin.github.io plenglin.github.io] takes you here!)

There is a [https://github.com/plenglin/astrid.tech/actions Github Actions] workflow that automatically builds on every push to verify that my code compiles. Additionally, if there was a push to the <code>main</code> branch, it will publish the build output to the [https://github.com/Plenglin/plenglin.github.io plenglin.github.io] repo.

=== UX design methodology ===

I've tried to make the browsing experience as user-friendly and inclusive as possible by:

* Adopting a mobile-first methodology for designing views, and responsively sizing elements in CSS
* Statically generating the site to reduce bandwidth consumption for users
* Utilizing semantic tags and designing the site to be accessible for screen readers

== Backend ==

Currently, the backend's only functionality is to serve and receive possibly anonymous comments.

I have pointed [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/astridyu/astrid_tech_api Docker Hub] at my repo to build, test, and release a new <code>:latest</code> image on every push to main.

It is deployed as a Docker container on a [https://contabo.com Contabo] VPS located in Missouri for about $8/mo. See [https://github.com/Plenglin/astrid.tech/blob/main/docker-compose.yml the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>] for deployment details. I will soon set up [https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower Watchtower] to automatically pull the image, so that the only thing I need to do with deployment is push to <code>main</code>.

== Content ==

The content is in its own [https://github.com/Plenglin/astrid.tech-content Git submodule] as a set of raw files that get aggregated and compiled on each frontend build. It is written in the following file formats:

* Markdown
* YAML
* Jupyter notebooks for a few blog posts (I wrote a custom Gatsby plugin that auto-transforms the Jupyter notebooks into Markdown files)
