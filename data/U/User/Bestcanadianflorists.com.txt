Hello all! My name is Fiona, and I'm active in the flower delivery market, looking to learn more about the Indieweb! I'm currently studying PHP and HTML to make better websites, and also connecting with wonderful people across Canada who are passionate about flowers and nature. 

I look forward to reading and learning more, thank you for making this place possible!
