'''<dfn>unitive</dfn>''' or <dfn>unitive web</dfn> is an alternative movement to Indieweb, with a broader remit to re-organise the entire internet from large key-providers using something they call "Spontaneous order".

It seems to lack the desire for individual expression, and instead focus on the needs of business.
