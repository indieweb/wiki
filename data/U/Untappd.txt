'''<dfn>Untappd</dfn>''' is a social [[silo]] for posting consumptions of beer (which they call "Check-ins" to beers) and optionally any or all of where ([[venue]], thus making it an actual [[checkin]]), 1-5 star [[rating]], [[photo]], or [[review]] commentary. Users can "toast" (a drink-specific form of [[like]]) each other's "check-ins". Users earn [[badges]] for the quantity and variety of beer they [[drink]]. One can also create [[wish|wishlists]] for beers they'd like to consume.

== Examples ==
* Post with beer, venue, rating: https://untappd.com/user/codebear/checkin/168610469
* Profile and activity feed: https://untappd.com/user/jeena

== PESOS==
{{main|PESOS}}

Posting to Untappd, via their app, is easy but getting your content out is a little trickier. They do offer standard "share" options but nothing automatic.

Untappd does provide users with an [[RSS]] feed for their posts. It can be found by logging in, visiting your account settings, and scrolling down to 'View your RSS feed'. 

=== WpeMatico plugin ===
[[User:Davidjohnmead.com]] uses the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpematico/ WpeMatico plugin] for [[WordPress]] to watch his Untappd RSS feeds. When a new entry appears it creates a post on his [http://davidjohnmead.com/blog blog].

As you can enter custom HTML when the WpeMatico plugin creates the post David Mead inserts the link back to the original post with rel="me".

=== Zapier ===
{{Khürt Williams}} uses [[Zapier]] to [https://islandinthenet.com/manual-until-it-hurts/ push Untappd check-ins back to his site]. An original [https://untappd.com/user/khurtwilliams/checkin/539563037 entry] is created on Untappd. When a new entry appears a Zapier generated [https://islandinthenet.com/crust-punk-dog/ post] is created on WordPress. The Zap is broken into two stages. The first stage uploads to WordPress the attachment image from the Untappd. The second stage attaches the uploaded image as a featured image, and pulls in various fields from Untappd. Using various Untappd fields, the excerpts section of the post is prepopulated with text, e.g. "I am drinking a Jersey Juice by Flying Fish Brewing Company at Rocky Hill Inn".  The post exceprt is used to set the tweet text. The post is set to publish immediately.

{{chrisburnell}}, too, uses [[Zapier]] to syndicate posts from Untappd back to his site. When Zapier polls Untappd for fresh entries (Trigger: New Check-In) and finds a new check-in, it grabs the associated data and POSTs (Webhook: POST) it to Chris’s [[Micropub]] endpoint. This data includes: the Beer’s name, Brewery, Rating, Badges, and Location amongst other generic bits like the date.

Examples:
* Post on Khürt's blog - https://islandinthenet.com/gazing-at-the-blasphemous-moon-while-perched-atop-a-very-very-very-very-very-very-forsaken-crest-of-the-northern-mountain/
* Original entry on Untappd - https://untappd.com/user/khurtwilliams/checkin/536990378

=== IFTTT ===
* Since 2020-02-25 {{chrisaldrich}} has used [[IFTTT]] to [[PESOS]] his checkins from Untappd to his personal website. He does this by plugging in his Untappd RSS Feed and outputting that data to a webhook on IFTTT to publish to the [[Micropub]] endpoint on his website to create a [[drink]] post. He describes the process [https://boffosocko.com/2020/02/22/owning-my-untappd-content/ here] with additional details about the syndication using IFTTT webhooks to Micropub [https://boffosocko.com/2020/01/21/using-ifttt-to-syndicate-pesos-content-from-social-services-to-wordpress-using-micropub/ here].
