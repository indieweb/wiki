'''<dfn>Untappd</dfn>''' is a social [[silo]] for posting consumptions of beer (which they call "Check-ins" to beers) and optionally any or all of where ([[venue]], thus making it an actual [[checkin]]), 1-5 star [[rating]], [[photo]], or [[review]] commentary. Users can "toast" (a drink-specific form of [[like]]) each other's "check-ins". Users earn badges for the quantity and variety of beer they drink.

== Examples ==
* Post with beer, venue, rating: https://untappd.com/user/codebear/checkin/168610469
* Profile and activity feed: https://untappd.com/user/jeena

Posting to Untappd, via their app, is easy but getting your content out is a little trickier. They do offer standard "share" options but nothing automatic.

[[User:Davidjohnmead.com]] uses the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpematico/ WpeMatico plugin] for [[WordPress]] to watch his Untappd RSS feeds. When a new entry appears it creates a post on his [http://davidjohnmead.com/blog blog].

You can find the Untappd RSS feed for your posts by logging in, visiting your account settings, and scrolling down to 'View your RSS feed'. 

As you can enter custom HTML when the WpeMatico plugin creates the post David Mead inserts the link back to the original post with rel="me".

=== Zapier ===

{{Khürt Williams}} uses [[Zapier]] to [https://islandinthenet.com/manual-until-it-hurts/ push Untappd check-ins back to his site]. An original [https://untappd.com/user/khurtwilliams/checkin/539563037 entry] is created on Untappd. When a new entry appears a Zapier generated [https://islandinthenet.com/crust-punk-dog/ post] is created on WordPress. The Zap is broken into two stages. The first stage uploads to WordPress the attachment image from the Untappd. The second stage attaches the uploaded image as a featured image, and pulls in various fields from Untappd. Using various Untappd fields, the excerpts section of the post is prepopulated with text, e.g. "I am drinking a Jersey Juice by Flying Fish Brewing Company at Rocky Hill Inn".  The post exceprt is used to set the tweet text. The post is set to publish immediately.
