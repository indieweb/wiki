Jekyll and rails site together? I need a contact form, comments, etc. - https://github.com/nz/jekyll-rails-hybrid

Compiling on cron/pings on server? 

Can we have the benefits of static and dynamic tools?

Not everything should be published with flat files

Can we have one way of delivering a site with both flat files and dynamic services

JS at webmention.io
webmention.herokuapp.com

Sinatra
http://www.sinatrarb.com/

Render a static site, pull in dynamic content with javascript

WHY DO WE USE STATIC SITE GENERATORS (e.g. JEKYLL)
* Well documented
* Supports
* No DB
* Free server on github pages
* Quick to use
* Simple, can use the github UI
* Be able to edit content in text files
