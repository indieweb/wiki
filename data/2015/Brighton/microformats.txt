2015-07-11 IndieWebCamp session in Brighton: Microformats

http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2

Check the indiewebcamp wiki post type pages for examples of how to mark up different types of posts, eg. indiewebcamp.com/Checkin

h - h-entry for blog posts, notes or other things you publish
p - p-name for title of the blog post
u - u-url for the permalink
dt - dt-published / dt-update 
e - e-content - giant chunk of html (content body of blog post would be e-content)

p-author for name 
h-card for extended contact information

"child" microformats correspond to the last parent p-thing

You could wrap posts on homepage as h-feed. You could then use a 3rd party service to generate an RSS feed from this

Could convert h-card to v-card to add to address book

Glenn has an "api" for his site, by adding /json to the url and getting the page contents back as json

* http://pin13.net/mf2/?url=

Use rel=next/previous for pagination

You can use microformats to check you're marking up your HTML properly eg using h-feed for main or h-entry for an article

What to do when you don't want author on every single post?
Old: includes.  
Put h-card somewhere out of the way.

Comments would be p-comment and also h-entry

Make sure share buttons aren't inside e-content. They can still be inside the h-entry

tommorris: developers who don't know microformats might just delete classes because there's no CSS for them.
adactio: I wouldn't use them as hooks for styling, personal preference.

glennjones: "it's the way we communicate"

idea for sunday, making an endpoint for people to make a feed

x-prefix for "new, experimental" formats
tommorris uses a x-dietary-requirements
should there be a page on the microformats wiki for people using new formats?
