PESOS & Quantified Self
* [[PESOS]]
* https://aaronpk.com/metrics

General consensus that people have lots of stuff spread around over many different networks. How to get that all in one place? Standards for importing stuff.

Tommorris suggests: a service that lets you backfill from eg. twitter via micropub

adactio: the good old days of RSS feeds, it was standard then

Merging of audiences. People used to split their interactions over different platforms to separate audience (eg. work versus personal) but now it's all merging.

glennjones: More specialised things like tracking running are harder to do via form-encoded POST micropub.

Instaport - only gets images with dates as filenames (eg. 2011-06-17_1308325493.jpg), no urls or likes
Can get Instagram photos from the API but you must be a programmer and write code

Backfeed: https://github.com/snarfed/freedom

Google Takeout

Gowalla site-death - still no export. ( if it was only Gowalla, see http://indiewebcamp.com/site-deaths )

RSS on providers -> https://petermolnar.eu/linux-tech-coding/rss-is-still-alive added to the wiki @ http://indiewebcamp.com/RSS

* SoundCloud
* Mixcloud
* Moves
* Github/bitbucket


Hijacking existing nice UIs (like twitter) with javascript injection, to make them post to your own site.

Is there a site that lists all the services and how easy it is to export data? (should we write this up on the wiki?) -> http://freemydata.co/ http://justdelete.me/


WordPress -> micropub converter
IFTTT -> micropub

Quantified self stuff is mostly in people's phones now. Apple Healthkit / Moves.
tommorris: Might not be a bad idea to build mobile apps that just ask for your website and auth, and post all the data that comes out of your phone to your site, for you to then use however you like (not necessarily publish straight away)

Moves is now owned by facebook *people freak out* -> freak out on this: https://medium.com/faith-and-future/stalking-your-friends-with-facebook-messenger-9da8820bd27d "Stalking Your Friends with Facebook Messenger"

http://aprilzero.com/explorer/ is a great example of using the data from Moves
