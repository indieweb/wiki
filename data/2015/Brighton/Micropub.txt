IWC Brighton 2015 micropub session notes

A micropub endpoint is a URL that sits on your site eg. example.com/micropub that accepts POST requests and does something with it

To stop anyone from posting to your site, it would sit on top of indieauth.com (or another provider) to authenticate

Amy's super basic PHP implementation: http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/04/minimum-viable-micropub
Jeremy's: https://gist.github.com/adactio/8168e6b78da7b16a4644

To authenticate you would prove you own the domain by adding rel="me" to links to you on other sites
indiewebcamp.com/relmeauth
indieauth.com

The micropub part is the easy part, it's the authentication that is more difficult

https://quill.p3k.io/docs has good info on implementing Micropub and creating an endpoint

http://reader.kylewm.com allows you to login and like posts, which would send your like back to your own site

https://github.com/bcomnes/gitpub for static sites?

Micropub enables you to have a crappy CMS but as long as it has a micropub endpoint it allows you to use any other editor you want

https://quill.p3k.io/editor could become an indie Medium posting interface
brief mention of creating a gallery of all the different editors
Jeremy posted https://adactio/notes/9244 live from Quill and https://adactio.com/notes/9245 from https://jonnybarnes.uk/notes/new

Amy adds "extra" properties in html comments for posts from Quill as it doesn't send everything her endpoint could be using

Micropub is the top of the "stack"

    rel="me"

    h-entry

    sending webmentions

    accepting webmentions

    publishing webmentions

    Micropub
