Making content look good is one of the toughest problems for indieweb, reason the silos have taken over.

== Challenges ==

=== Types ===

** be better than Twitter = probably good enough
** mobile readability

*** Medium
**** depends on header image
**** single column, no side-by-side
*** Tumblr

** challenges
*** pretty static graph generated server-side

* likes
** good practices
*** include title or some context, not just "likes this post"

* bookmarks
** good examples
*** pinboard.in - highlight text + bookmark = grabs the text in description of bookmark
*** tumblr reblogging + add a tag
*** pinterest - for things that have a photo "image is the primary reason"
