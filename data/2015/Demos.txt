* each post shows map of where purchase happened

* types a description into his posting UI on his mobile device
* logs into his site on the laptop
* shows posting UI on laptop

* http://thetapestries.net
* Next up is John!
* demoing tapestry maker
* writen in node
* is a space for a community of people
* demoing indiemetachat
* indieweb focuses on the individual
* spaces for communities compliment individual sites
* not everyone wants a public profile
* how do we have areas where we can have private discussions?
* demoing a social tarot reading
* a place for discussing tarot readings as a community
* “Everybody I talk to is ready to be done with Facebook"
* there is still a lot of work to make indieweb accessable to non technical people
* “They talk about their time on Facebook like junk food. You do a lot of stuff and you don’t feel good afterwards.”
* (so quotable!)
* people just want to have a good time and enjoy themselves
* (its true it doesn't take much to put together a fun online community)
* adding audio to a community chat room
* (plays high pace EDM from a chat channel)

* at one HWC meetup she bought her domain
* at the next HWC she got hosting and got WordPress setup
* Jeena asks - what was it that made you come to Homebrew Website Club?
* Jennifer came to HWC because she wanted to learn from people who already had websites
* “There’s only one way to learn, and that’s to ask people who know and do stuff”
* "all it takes is wanting to do it to make it happen"
* the indieweb plugins have been really helpful

=== Aaron ===
* http://aaronparecki.com
* using talky on a mobile device to show his Pebble watch
* to show posting from his food app
* has a coffee
* pushes one button and it posts
* literally an example of a one-button posting UI

=== Tantek ===
* http://tantek.com/
* [https://youtu.be/H2awcInYgw4?t=14m38s Video]
* i tried to work on 3 things. I got 2 and some fraction done
* the 1st thing is trying to converge comment markup so we can do it consistently (twtr.io/11ZZQoJL0Co)
* worked it out with a group of us and has updated code on wiki page
* under [[comments-presentation]]
* each comment should use p-comment h-cite (assuming they are from some other site) since your copy of the comment is really a copy of the text from someone else's site
** Update shortly thereafter: '''<code>u-comment h-cite</code>''' as documented on [[comments-presentation#How_to_markup]] (and see that for any future revisions).
* if you're consuming comments this is structure you can rely on (twtr.io/11ZZeVYT7JR)
* second thing was scoped styles which worked only in firefox
* ... looking at post in its permalink it covers the whole page (intentionally)
* the second thing I showed was scoped styles, which I had before on my site (twtr.io/11ZZhSwneE8)
* but now I got it working in chrome and safari as well as firefox despite them not supporting it (twtr.io/11ZZk4xzLbH)
* ... opening in chrome or safari, this works equivalently on the other browsers
* ... those changes do not put any extra work on to the publishing, but is entirely inside the software
* ... will document later my techniques
* ... third item is working on mobile version of site
* the 3rd thing I wanted to do was getting my site looking good on mobile, so lets see if this works (twtr.io/11ZZu1x6HPC)
* my first goal was to get my homepage looking good on mobile - not wrapping URLs badly (twtr.io/11ZZzxKmHPD)
* ... text is pretty readable no matter what kind of post
* ... only improvements left are to get photos to be full bleed (all the way to the edge of the device

=== Jon ===
* http://jonericbenson.com/
* [https://youtu.be/H2awcInYgw4?t=22m38s Video]

* I'm sarah, my url is http://themostawful.com (twtr.io/11Z_Fn7H6ct)
* setup a webmention endpoint on her site!

=== Bryan ===
* http://chreekat.net/
* [https://youtu.be/H2awcInYgw4?t=24m19s Video]
* added support for h-entry to the forum he was working on
* I started with a small discussion and came up with exchanges between people in markup (twtr.io/11Z_WuBHX5c)
* h-entry for the comment, h-card and p-author dt- for dates and u- for photos (twtr.io/11Z_ZfhYNbo)
* used glennjones.net/tools/microformats/ to check his microformats
* microformats are now live: [http://glennjones.net/tools/microformats/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsnowdrift.coop%2Fp%2Fsnowdrift%2Fw%2Fen%2Fcoding%2Fd&callback=&dateformat=auto parsed example]

=== Bret ===
* http://bret.io/
* [https://youtu.be/H2awcInYgw4?t=28m53s Video]
* made a node.js module for parsing bearer tokens
* with tests!
* a micropub endpoint has to get a bearer token from a micropub client request (twtr.io/11Z_vhazKKV)
* I made a node module for parsing bearer tokens that abstracts the complexities away (twtr.io/11Z_yHTCdQ0)

=== Jennifer ===
* http://yourmom.io/
* [https://youtu.be/H2awcInYgw4?t=30m31s Video]
* fully deployed a microformats2 supporting WordPress theme

=== Aaron ===
* http://aaronparecki.com/
* [https://youtu.be/H2awcInYgw4?t=35m22s Video]
* then I worked on SWAT0 the tagging test http://indiewebcamp.com/SWAT0 (twtr.io/11ZatxzvZBU)
* ben took a photo of me https://ben.thatmustbe.me/photo/2015/7/12/9/ and tagged me in a photo and my phone notified me (twtr.io/11Zaxn348fZ)
* I got hat notification (twtr.io/11Zaz0kXv5b)
* ben updating the photo was amy hitting the like button (twtr.io/11Zb7fcSAuw)
* and these comments are now on ben's post, which notified me (twtr.io/11ZbBP2AqNx)
* @aaronpk: now I can sign into woodwind and log in with twitter - wait, twitter is down (twtr.io/11ZbJnYEqaj)
* fortunately indieauth means I don't have to use twitter, I can use last.fm (twtr.io/11ZbJP2xcGo)
* @aaronpk: I cna post my own comment now in the reader and that posts on my site and ping ben's (twtr.io/11ZbQAUaC_8)
* @aaronpk: and I got a notification that http://aaronparecki.com commented on my photo on ben's site (twtr.io/11ZbTb3v6A8)

=== Kevin ===
* http://kevinmarks.com/
* [https://youtu.be/H2awcInYgw4?t=44m45s Video]
* worked on indiecards
* reworked it as a hovercard
* designed to work in an iframe
* he’s incorporated indiecards into noterlive.com
* (aside: they’re not hovercards - hovercards are a very specific presentational effect in response to users *hovering* over something)
* had to cache tantek.com
* and thus caches cards in general now
