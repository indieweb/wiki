Linked Data 

Notes from IWC 2015 Dusseldorf

Discussing use cases for using canonical linked data URIs (like dbpedia.org) for places for checkins
Disambiguating places, eg. seeing if we have both been to the same city
Not having to maintain datasets about places (including different languages)
Checkin by geolocation and it finds everything else for you. You just pick a place, then later you can say 'find me all my restaurant checkins' and it can, but you never had to tell it you were in a restaurant because it finds that from external data.
Augmenting microformats by adding terms at your own namespace, eg. you can only mark up a venue with an address in microformats, but you might want to add what type of venue it is.
