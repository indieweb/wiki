[[Matrix]]
Can implement chat using the Matrix protocol.
* Open-source; JSON over HTTP
* All messages stored on your server
* Protocol to standardise how IMs are sent/received
* Specficiation: http://matrix.org/docs/spec/
* Bunch of client SDKs available on Github

What you can do:
* Run your own Home Server to add IM/VoIP to your site using the reference server implementation: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse
** Other implementations in early stages - Pallium (in Go: https://github.com/KoFish/pallium ) and jSynapse (in Java: https://github.com/swarmcom/jSynapse/ )
* Federate with the Matrix ecosystem (get bridged services like IRC for free)
* Matrix supports any old JSON; it's not just for IM. Add in support for blog posting? In the past, people have done stuff for drones (position data), animations (spline data), music sharing (MIDI as JSON), etc
* Write bridges to de-silo other services (bridges for XMPP/IRC/Slack/libpurple)

How to integrate matrix with existing indieweb messaging/posting protocols?

Micropub (JSON) -> Matrix?
(ie. could Matrix support micropub vocabulary?) 

Federation via webmention?
