Combine with WebMentions to add to other site?

Intention problem - Make sure addition is really wanted - https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieNews/issues/9#issuecomment-124846594 link to home page

Silo APIs
* ICS ones: Meetup,Lanyrd, EventBrite
* Facebook: oh dear no
Events in emails
* attached ICS file in GMail

Categorising problems - importing and exporting    

Issues with passing events around freely
* what is original source? For changes etc
* matching events from different sources? if details are slightly different

James to do sunday: import microformats to OpenACalendar or RSVP by webmention to OpenACalendar


CalDAV endpoint/server (Fran)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV
* http://radicale.org/ (server) and most of the calendar clients

Recurring events aaaargh. (rhiaro has not dealt with these for her site yet)

Public events are being done... but private events could be harder (same as private posts)

Notifications/reminders for events on your own calendar. (kegan. rhiaro wants this!)

Inline RSVPs to indie events via micropub.
