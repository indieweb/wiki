== Notes ==

Have a micropub endpoint that adds files to your static site?
Might be nice to have a web interface to publish short posts quickly, even if you normally make blog posts in a text editor and checkin to git.
Checkout [[gitpub]]!

Also [[jekmentions]]

Write posts to a json file, and display with javascript? Use fragment urls?

I prefer to write new posts at proper urls. (River)

Comments: Can pull in webmentions when site is built, maybe on a cron job.
What about people who can't webmention and just want a form on the blog post? Need something running on a server to receive this.
