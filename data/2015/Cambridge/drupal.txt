Drupal - https://www.drupal.org/home - is a content management framework supporting some 2% of the web including many large and prominent sites.  It is free software and has a very large and active community.

this seems to be the best shot at Webmentions https://github.com/sanduhrs/vinculum/tree/7.x-2.x

working on getting contrib access here.

should implement this http://webmention.org/ - already a bug is flagged for pingback spam, how do we implement spam control??

see https://www.drupal.org/node/1987964

auto-link URLs directly - the input filters can do this

auto-link @-names to Twitter profiles - the Twitter module can do this and some others too ( http://drupal.org/project/twitter

<pre>
need: 
 p-location
  h-entry
   h-geo or h-adr
</pre>

https://indiewebcamp.com/feed
* This can be done with feeds module
* h-feed and h-entry. should be semantic tags on the views entries

Development strategy:
* try to use existing drupal modules. Likely a Feeds module plugin for import/export?
* this could be used as a linter http://indiewebify.me/
* another one http://glennjones.net/tools/microformats/
Microformat background info 
* french background info on microformats and drupal
* http://microformats.org/wiki/implementations-fr
h-atom enabled using drupal referenced:
* http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom-examples-in-wild
* microformats cheat sheet
* https://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/microformats-cheat-sheet/
* hatom to atom libraries. helpful?
* https://github.com/robertbachmann/microformats-x2v

one of these or similar should be able to ingest dang near any microformat https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds_ex
