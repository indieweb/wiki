== Notes ==

Tantek comments that the stuff he posts is a small percentage of the things he WANTS to post. A common problem. Currently organizes with two text files. In one, brain dumps thoughts with links and date. On occasion, for an occasion, cherry picks thoughts from the first file into a second, scheduled to be finished by a particular time, such as a conference. 

Collection of ideas/Prioritization....Distraction!!

Is there a good way to collect one's ideas easily?

Is there a good draft selection method?

There are 4 layers of posting for tantek
# collecting random ideas
# prioritizing some of them as to be done before an event
# sorting/clustering ideas into a cohesive narrative as a post
# good writing, proper prose, article structure, beginning / middle / end
# posted

ben.thatmustbe.me - I post my drafts to my site semi-privately and iterate within my site so I have full control of the iterations.

=== Problem Statement ===

I have some thoughts but don't have time to write a post.

I want to write some posts before an event, e.g. for that event.

I don't know what to write about!

My post is getting too big - how do I split it?
* How do I constrain the subject sooner to not overwrite or get lost on a tangent?

If the topic is able to split, then you know that or you don't.

If it can be split, then you've got a chapter book.

Your splits are more like pause for breath.

Sometimes I'm purposely pausing for input, which can benefit writing more about it later.


=== Suggestions ===

Write a few sentences, just a paragraph, short note commentary about what you've read.

Tagging can help organize the random ideas. 

Then later collect a bunch of notes into a longer blog post

E.g. http://tantek.com/2015/068/b1/security-towards-minimum-viable-web-platform

Timebox: set aside an hour to blog with the goal of publishing at least one finished post. More is better! If you get one post done, go for it and do a second one.

== Questions ==

What is the level below draft?

Why not start in the same format and just keep it moving along?
