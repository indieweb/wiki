== Notes ==

{{benthatmustbeme}} is aggregating IRC back onto his own site as a start

direct messag to ben_thawr on IRC logs to my site

Firefox Hello and other systems already exist to handle direct video in the browser but not really for texting

/contact pages could contain a form to send a message directly to the person on whatever method they prefer at that moment

indication of when messages have been received:
BBM - the original "better than SMS"
* showed sent/received/read status of every message sent
E.g. Facebook messenger shows various message sending/sent/received states
* sending to server: spinning ?
* failed to reach server: red exclamation point
* server received: small empty circle
* device received: small empty circle with a dot inside - receiver's device has the message
* has been read: small circle replaced completely by small disc of receiver's icon
iMessage / Messages
* sending to server. progress bar
* failed to reach server: red exclamation point
* device received. "Delivered"
* has been read: "Read" (can be disabled by receiver)
AIM (oscar protocol)
* showed when a user was typing if they had this option set
* pidgin (libpurple) plugin for "Psychic mode" showed when a message box was opened to you before even receiving a message
