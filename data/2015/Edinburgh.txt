<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. To grow it and help people gettings started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Edinburgh for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, teaching, helping.

Join us in Edinburgh and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe more importantly – encourage users to own their own content and identities.
