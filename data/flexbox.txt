"The <dfn>Flexbox</dfn> Layout (Flexible Box) module (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex")." <ref>[http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ A complete guide to flexbox]</ref>

Flexbox makes it easier to create complex and responsive layouts with fairly simple css rules paired with a simple html structure.  It has decent browser support at this point, so why not treat yourself to responsive "holy grail" layouts and sticky footers without the hasstle of doing it the old way.
