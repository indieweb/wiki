== Brainstorming ==
=== How to make your own ===
Any thoughts on ideas, techniques, templates etc. for making up 88x31 images for your personal site that others can add to their blogrolls, sidebars, fan pages etc.?

=== How to markup ===
If you host an 88x31 button for your homepage (or any page on your site!) you can use standard HTML link rel=icon and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#sizes sizes attribute] to link to it so others can discover it:
<pre>
<link rel="icon" sizes="88x31" href="examplebutton.png" />
</pre>
Where you replace <samp>examplebutton.png</samp> with the name (relative or absolute URL) to the 88x31 button you want to represent that page (and on your homepage, the whole site).
