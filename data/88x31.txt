'''<dfn>88x31</dfn>''' pixels was a very popular web [[badge]]/[[button]] image size in the [[1990s]], especially among freewheeling and independent sites created on services like [[GeoCities]], and there are IndieWeb 88x31 badges you may use.

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
If you like the [[1990s]]-era retro web, create an 88x31 button for your site that others can you use to link to you, e.g. in their sidebar or [[blogroll]]!

== How to ==
=== How to create an 88x31 image ===
There are a handful of online tools you can use to create 88x31 buttons in similar styles to past buttons:
* [https://sadgrlonline.github.io/archived-sadgrl.online/projects/88x31-button-maker.html Sadgrl's 88x31 button maker]
* [https://hekate2.github.io/buttonmaker/ Hekate's 88x31 Web Button Maker]
* The [https://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/ Silkscreen font] is popular for text on these buttons
=== How to markup discovery ===
If you host an 88x31 button for your homepage (or any page on your site!) you can use standard HTML link rel=icon and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#sizes sizes attribute] to link to it so others can discover it:
<pre>
<link rel="icon" sizes="88x31" href="examplebutton.png" />
</pre>
Where you replace <samp>examplebutton.png</samp> with the name (relative or absolute URL) to the 88x31 button you want to represent that page (and on your homepage, the whole site).

== Unnecessary specs ==
There is no need for a new HTML element, attribute, <code>rel</code> value, <code>&lt;meta name=&gt;</code> value, <code>&lt;meta property=&gt;</code> value, or certainly no [[well-known]] side-file mechanism.

See [[88x31#How_to_markup_discovery|How to markup discovery]] above for how to do so using existing HTML:
* <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element
* <code>rel</code> attribute
* <code>rel="icon"</code> attribute value
* <code>sizes</code> attribute
* <code>sizes="88x31"</code> attribute value
* and <code>href</code> attribute for the URL of your 88x31 image

Please don't repeat [[XKCD 927]] for no good reason. E.g.
* Unnecessary new use of [[.well-known]]:
** https://codeberg.org/LunarEclipse/well-known-button
* Unnecessary new <code>meta property</code> value:
** https://blog.vbuckenham.com/the-88x31-button-spec/
