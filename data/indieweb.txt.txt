https://indieweb.org/indieweb.txt

indieweb.txt is a proposal (first discussed at IndieWebCamp Brighton 2015) for a strategy to allow IndieWeb site owners to share information about:

* IndieWeb tools they are using (e.g. [https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io The aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io webmention plugin for Jekyll-based sites], https://www.brid.gy/, etc.)
* IndieWeb 'strategies'
* [[IndieMark]] score (and potentially details of 'compliance' with each item within each level)
* notes on relevance of IndieWeb to personal web life (why one is embracing IndieWeb strategies, etc.)

=== Why ===

* Sharing information on tools and practices across a growing movement, enabling interested people to discover which tools and strategies IndieWeb site owners are using
* Self-reflection: personal motivation to review one's own IndieMark occasionally
* Contributing to a better understanding of the evolution of the IndieWeb (also see: https://snarfed.org/indie-stats)

=== Inspiration ===

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard robots.txt]
* [http://humanstxt.org/ humans.txt]
* [https://usesthis.com/ The Setup: "A nerdy little interview website, asking people what they use to get stuff done"] (source code available: https://github.com/waferbaby/usesthis/)

=== Implementation ===

* Could be a free-form text file
* But ideally should at least have some basic structure (like robots.txt or humans.txt)
* Shouldn't probably be at a fixed, hardcoded location - a rel link tag could probably be used: e.g. 
 <link rel="indieweb" href="/some/where/indieweb.txt" />

==== Brainstorming suggestions ====

From the brainstorming session at IndieWebCamp Brighton 2015:

* point to multiple structured resources describing tools/strategies/IndieMark 'compliance'
* see [http://rng.io/ RingMark] - both in terms of running automated checks and of visualizing in a very intuitive way the level of compliance
* extend the advertising items to include API endpoints to interact with the site (e.g. to post content, replies, etc. - this is mostly covered by existing strategies, but could be useful for ad-hoc APIs)

=== Feedback ===

* HTML perhaps? Indie '''Web'''. ðŸ˜€ â€”[[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris.org]] 08:13, 12 July 2015 (PDT)
