{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>site archive</dfn>''' is an [[archive]] of an entire version of a site, often made static, and typically served at a subdomain of the original site.

A site archive is still considered an archive (rather than an [[archival copy]]) when served from a subdomain (or even subpath) of its previous domain, in contrast to being served from another domain entirely like archive.org.

== Why ==
To preserve your previous site content and URLs (with redirects) without worrying about having to replicate everything in your new/current site.

== How ==
* Use a subdomain on your original site. 
* Setup redirects for your old URLs to use the subdomain version.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has archived at least a couple of past versions of his site:
* http://2015.aaronparecki.com
* http://2012.aaronparecki.com

== See Also ==
* [[archive]]
* [[longevity]]
* [[archival copy]]
