{{stub}}

This page describes using IndieAuth for authentication rather than [[obtaining-an-access-token|authorization]]. In this case, no token endpoint or Micropub endpoint are needed, and '''the user did not delegate authorization to a specific endpoint''' so the client searches for known authentication providers.

== Examples ==

In these examples, the following URLs will be used.

The site the user is signing in to is the IndieWebCamp wiki:
* client_id = https://indiewebcamp.com
* redirect_uri = https://indiewebcamp.com/auth/callback

The user signing in is [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]:
* me = https://aaronparecki.com/

In this example, Aaron has not delegated authorization to an external service, but instead has added a [[rel-me|rel=me]] link to other profiles:
* <nowiki>&lt;a href="https://github.com/aaronpk" rel="me"&gt;github.com/aaronpk&lt;/a&gt;</nowiki>
* <nowiki>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk" rel="me"&gt;twitter.com/aaronpk&lt;/a&gt;</nowiki>
* <nowiki>&lt;link rel="pgpkey" href="/files/key.asc"&gt;</nowiki>

== Web Sign-In Form ==

The site contains a web sign-in form prompting the user to enter their URL to sign in. Upon submitting the form, the site begins the auth process by discovering the user's auth endpoint, and if none is found, looks for supported rel=me services.

== Discovery ==

aaronparecki.com points to multiple silo authorization services by specifying rel=me values on the index page, as well as links to a GPG key.

<pre>&lt;link rel="me" href="https://github.com/aaronpk"&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;link rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk"&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;link rel="pgpkey" href="/files/key.asc"&gt;</pre>

=== Authorization ===
The wiki should present an interface describing the request being made. It must indicate:
* The name of the site making the request
* Give the user choices of using any supported auth providers they have listed on their home page

== Complete ==

After the site authenticates the user at one of their mutually agreed upon providers, the site can consider the user signed in.
