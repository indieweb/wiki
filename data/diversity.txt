'''<dfn>Diversity</dfn>''' is the extent to which a group's participants are representative of a wide range of human attributes including, but not limited to, race, gender, religion, age, sexual orientation, able-bodiedness, education, socioeconomic status, political leaning, national origin, etc. 

A group's diversity can be measured by its ability to sustain participation among members who fall on very different points on the spectrum within a single attribute, and also by sustaining variations among many different attributes at once.

=== Tech sector shortcomings ===

"Improving diversity" has become a major topic among technology companies as a response to numerous studies linking high-diversity groups to [http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/02/diversity-collaboration-teams-leadership-managing-creativity.html being more willing to express unique opinions], [http://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation/ar/1 broadening the pool of knowledge], and [http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/is_there_a_payoff_from_top-team_diversity positive business outcomes]. Unfortunately, [http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html Google's diversity report], along with [http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/05/google-diversity-labor-gender-race-gap-workers-silicon-valley data from other Silicon Valley companies], shows that the tech industry still has a long way to go.

=== Within Indie Web Camp ===

The lack of diversity among tech companies reflects a larger systemic pattern of ignorance, inattentiveness, and/or exclusion with regard to minority groups in STEM fields, and Indie Web Camp isn't immune to those forces:

<blockquote>So, who else is coming to @indiewebcamp Brighton? There’s currently an embarrassing all-white-male list of “creators” http://indiewebcamp.com/2014/UK/Guest_List#Creators … [https://twitter.com/aral/status/499216588416233472]</blockquote>

Besides societal forces, there may be other factors that hinder the adoption of Indie Web Camp [[principles]] among marginalized groups:

* "Owning your data", or at the very least owning a domain name, involve a monetary cost that is a very real barrier to entry. In addition, domain name registrants are required to provide their name and contact information on publicly-available WHOIS requests. Groups who require careful [[privacy]] measures because of their marginalized status are hit especially hard by this.
* "Build tools for yourself" presupposes a programming and development education that most minority populations have never been exposed to. In essence, they are being asked to contribute their diverse life experience ''and also'' be able to build the medium on which to express themselves. Pre-built solutions like [[WordPress]] and [[Known]] will be much more attractive.
* "Plurality of projects" may be attractive to developer-centric groups that understand the differences in implementations, but the number of choices will be overwhelming for the uninitiated. Rather than simply listing the available [[projects]], a table listing supported features and gotchas for each project would allow people to choose a solution based on their skill-level and needs.

=== Improving diversity ===

* Encourage existing minorities within the group to take more active / visible roles. Visible minority members are a strong indicator that the group is "safe".

<blockquote>So I looked for something which looked like “me”, or described “me”, but I just found it to be about a diff community. [https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/499219226499219457]</blockquote>

<blockquote>i would NEVER even consider going to a conference like that TBH b/c when i look at that photo i'm like, ahhh, a place where i'm not safe. [https://twitter.com/shanley/status/512993316346933249]</blockquote>

* Expand options for virtual participation at conferences. There are enough barriers without adding geography into the mix.

* Go to the groups you're seeking and ask for help. Programs like the [http://www.eventbrite.com/e/focus100-2014-the-most-diverse-tech-conference-on-the-planet-oct-3-4-2014-tickets-9835901446 Focus Conference] and [http://www.300secondsbrighton.com/ 300 Seconds] will point you in the right direction, or even contacting women's colleges and historically black universities.

* Identify IndieWebCamp features that are useful to marginalized communities and are being undermined or ignored on silos. Embrace [http://anomalily.net/the-indie-web-is-the-new-zines/ your off-beat culture], find groups that would benefit from it, and invite them to try it.

* Get advice from people that run successful inclusive unconferences and BarCamps. Vanessa Gennarelli wrote an [http://mozzadrella.me/post/94478195501/how-to-design-a-conference-for-equity-and-learning excellent primer] on the subject.
