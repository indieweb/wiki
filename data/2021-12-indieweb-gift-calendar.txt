The 2021 '''<dfn>IndieWeb Gift Calendar</dfn>''' is the 5th annual group effort to gift (ship) one or more IndieWeb-related thing(s) each day of December that others can use to improve their IndieWeb experience. 

This can be anything from major [[wikify|wiki documentation contributions / improvements]] to shipping updates on any of the IndieWeb applications (like [[social reader]]s), [[services]], [[CMS]]s, [[plugin]]s, [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], or any other projects in use by multiple folks. 

__TOC__
Welcome to the 5th annual '''IndieWeb Gift Calendar'''! Anyone can participate, and if you‚Äôre looking for ideas, see the '''[[#Inspiration|Inspiration section below]]'''. 
* See previous years (e.g. '''[[2020-12-indieweb-gift-calendar|2020]], [[2019-12-indieweb-gift-calendar|2019]], [[2018-12-indieweb-challenge|2018]]''') for specific examples.

Please keep in mind the '''[[#Considerations|Considerations]]''' and if you‚Äôre not sure, you may want to first make a '''[[2022-01-01-commitments|commitment for yourself]]''' (and follow through) to ship something you‚Äôll use on your own site, as it will likely help reveal ways to improve things for the community as a whole that others can also use.

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below!

== Considerations ==
Gifts can be anything from major [[wikify|wiki documentation contributions / improvements]] to shipping updates on any of the IndieWeb applications (like [[social reader]]s), [[services]], [[CMS]]s, [[plugin]]s, [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], or any other projects in use by multiple folks. 

Please keep in mind the following considerations when adding something to a day:
* It must be shipping / usable, not just a blog post announcing / saying you plan to do it.
* Is it clear what your thing does?
* Is it clear how someone is supposed to use it or otherwise benefit from it?
* What use-case does it solve for others (besides yourself)? Ask yourself, how would/could someone else in the community use the thing I'm posting? 
* If it's a markup / styling example, is it clear what its purpose is, and how someone could/should copy the markup/styling and customize it for their own site?
* If it's a programming example, is it clear how an indieweb site could use the code, using what language(s)? Does it require any frameworks?
* If it's a code example or project, is it clearly open sourced, with a clear link to its GitHub or other code repo that has at least a README explaining how it can be used for either direct user benefit or to enhance existing indieweb sites?

== Inspiration ==
Looking for something to do to benefit the community?

In general (feel free to add things here that you find inspiring in general, or hope someone else is inspired to do :)
* Updates to / new versions of '''[[2020-12-indieweb-gift-calendar|things shipped in last year‚Äôs calendar]]'''
* '''[[to-do]]''' and look for something you can do in a day!
* [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues IndieWebify issues] to fix, fix one, and get an update deployed
* New release of [[microformats2]] parser(s)
** php-mf2
** ...
* Work on [[2021-review]] and previous years that weren't completed
* Organize and host a virtual IndieWeb [[event]]
* ...
