[http://github.com/fiatjaf/coisas coisas] is a multipurpose CMS that runs in the browser and deploys the static HTML it generates to GitHub Pages.

It forces you to organize your content into a hierarchy of pages, each of which may have markdown or HTML text and any number of children. So you start with one page, at the root address, and add children from it.

All the pages are generated from the same HTML template, so they all feature a global title and description, a navigation bar indicating where in the website that page is located, and a list of children of that page.

Coisas does not come with any CSS, so the generated website at the first time you do it is very crude, what is good, so you can style it easily with a minimum of global CSS rules, and also style any page individually, as each page is rendered with its path passed as classes to its HTML.

To try it yourself, go to [http://github.com/fiatjaf/coisas-template this template], fork it, rename it and you're ready to go.

==Abandoned==

Development of coisas was stopped at the end of 2014 due to the complications of dealing directly and only with the GitHub REST API from the browser, and also because its main developer, [[User:Fiatjaf.alhur.es|fiatjaf]], discovered that GitHub Pages actually renders Jekyll blogs, not only hosts them.
