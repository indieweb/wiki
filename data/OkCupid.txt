'''<dfn>OkCupid</dfn>''' is a dating social network.

== Criticism ==
=== "We Experiment on Human Beings!" ===
Following the news of Facebook's [[Facebook#Social_experiment_performed_on_users|social experiments performed on users]], OkCupid published a post with the above title, practically boasting about the experiments they have run on people. These experiments included telling bad matches that they were actually good matches and vice versa.

<blockquote>To test this, we took pairs of bad matches (actual 30% match) and told them they were exceptionally good for each other (displaying a 90% match.)† Not surprisingly, the users sent more first messages when we said they were compatible. After all, that’s what the site teaches you to do.<br><br>
. . .<br><br>
So we tested things the other way, too: we told people who were actually good for each other, that they were bad, and watched what happened.

On NPR, the president of OkCupid referred to the "charade of consent" with their terms and conditions. [http://www.npr.org/2014/07/29/336356931/okcupid-sometimes-messes-a-bit-with-love-in-the-name-of-science]
