A '''<dfn>personal domain</dfn>''' is a domain name that you personally own, control, and use to represent yourself on the internet. Getting a personal domain is the first step towards getting on the indieweb, and is therefore a requirement for [[IndieMark]] Level 1.

== How ==
* '''Get your own personal domain name''' - Ask a friend or colleague for a [[domain name registrar]] that they use and like/trust/respect etc.
* '''Domain Privacy''' - Note that most domain name registrars will make your personal information (name, mailing address, phone number and email address) publicly available via whois lookups. Some registrars offer domain privacy options, so that instead of your personal details the registrar's details will be in the whois directory. Only use domain privacy if you fully trust the provider of the service -- disputes about domain name administration or transfers may get tricky if you are not listed as the legal owner of the domain.

== Why ==
Why? All the reasons listed in [[why]]. This is the key first step to joining the indieweb.

=== Examples of domains being used IRL for disambiguation ===

<blockquote>Two employees at http://corp.oz.com/ were both called Sveinbjörn — one held sveinbjorn.is, the other sveinbjörn.org. A common company practise was to reply to “where’s Sveinbjörn?” with “dot is or dot org?”</blockquote> — [[User:Suda.co.uk|Brian Suda]]

== Free Domain Names ==

There are some top level domain names who’s registrars give out domain names for free. It’s not currently known what degree of control users have over these domains, or whether or not it’s viable to use them long-term, but they have the potential to open up the possibility of having a space on the indieweb to people who either can’t, or don’t want to pay for domains.

[[Freenom]] offer a [https://my.freenom.com/details/free_domains.html developers plan] which comes with an API allowing programmatic registration and administration of free domains. This could be used by organisations offering content hosting services to simply have a “domain name” field on the registration form, and automatically set it up, preventing users from having to worry about payment or technical DNS configuration.

=== Free Domain Registrars ===
The free domain registrars that currently exist are:
* [http://www.dot.tk/ Dot TK]: exclusive registrar of TK domains (Tokelau)
* [http://www.my.ga/ My GA]: exclusive registrar of GA domains (Gabon)
* [http://www.dot.cf/ Dot CF]: exclusive registrar of CF domains (Central African Republic)
* [http://www.point.ml/ Point ML]: exclusive registrar of ML domains (Mali)

These registrars were given exclusive rights over their respective country's [[TLD]] in order to generate revenue for the local government. Despite registering domains for free, they have alternate revenue streams that may include (but aren't limited to):
* DNS and web hosting services
* "Brand protection" services that allow subscribers to block the registration of protected trademarks
* Selling expired domains at a premium
* Selling name, email, or other contact information
* Selling traffic information for your website

In exchange for a free domain, users must agree to a [[Terms of Service]] that is comparable to those of most [[silos]]. The terms for the revocation of a free domain may include displaying objectionable or illegal material, showing adult content, providing information on illegal drugs or other contraband, displaying someone else's intellectual property, using the account for spam, etc. Many of the terms are very broad and may be prone to abuse, so using a free domain to protect your voice and identity in a dangerous circumstance is not recommended.

It should be noted that all of the existing free domain registrars use [[Freenom]] as their backend for handling account registration. As a result, all have a similar feature set:

* Allows forwarding to a URL
* Allows specifying an A record for the bare domain and the "www." variant
* Allows specifying your own DNS server
* Offers to create a free static website with [[http://www.imcreator.tk/ imcreator.tk]] (a separate registration with imcreator.tk is required)
* Domains can be registered for 1 to 12 months
* Domains can only be renewed by registering with a valid email address
* WHOIS information for free domains will display "domain administrator" information, so no personally identifiable information is displayed

== Namecoin ==
[http://namecoin.info/ Namecoin] is a bitcoin fork, originally founded to be a decentralized DNS network for .bit domains.

Pros:
* decentralized
* anonym

Cons:
* requires mining or buying namecoins
* requires running a daemon to maintain the infrastructure
