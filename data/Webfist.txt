<dfn>Webfist</dfn> is the software used to run a distributed fallback network to enable webfinger on email address from providers that do not yet support webfinger.  It was first implemented during the [[2013]] indiewebcamp.  More information can be found at the [http://webfist.org Webfist website].  An overview of how it works can also be found at [http://www.onebigfluke.com/2013/06/bootstrapping-webfinger-with-webfist.html Brett Slatkin's blog].  The brainstorming session page from 2013 also has links to some information: [[2013/WebFinger_Past_Present_Future]]
