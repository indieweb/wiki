'''<dfn>wikifying</dfn>''' is the practice of putting stuff on the wiki, or something in particular on the wiki. E.g. We need to wikify that ([[FAQ]]|concept|jargon|etherpad).

== Why ==
Wikifying both in general, and particular subjects, notes, or documents, helps grow the searchable & discoverable [[commons]] of the IndieWebCamp community.

== How to ==
=== Wikify yourself ===
Like many things in IndieWebCamp, start by editing your own page, in this case, your own "User:" page.

Your "User:" page is linked from the bottom of footer links, first link on the third row, with the name of your domain that you used to login to the wiki (just before "My talk").

Click on it and edit your User: page.

If you're not sure what to put on your User: page, start simple. Name, URL, h-card, e.g.
<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-card">[http://mydomain.example.com/ Your Name]</span>
</nowiki></pre>

Next, add an itches section where you capture '''what you want to work on for your own site''', personal online digital presence, and personal digital device usage (e.g. even when offline) in general. E.g.

<pre><nowiki>
== Itches ==
* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* Figure out a [[URL design]] for my posts
* Start posting [[notes]] manually at [[permalinks]]
* Try checking my site in indiewebify.me
* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site
</nowiki></pre>

When you start collecting lots of itches, you may want to start prioritizing them, especially by what you're currently working on. Start a "Working on" section for that:

<pre><nowiki>
== Working On ==
* the next thing I'm working on for my site
* the next next thing I'm working on getting working on my site
* ... etc.
</nowiki></pre>


Lastly, check out others' User: pages, especially folks that have been doing this a while, to see what else you could add to yours and work on.
* {{t}}
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{GWG}}
* {{kylewm}}
* {{benwerd}}
* ...

==== Focus ====
As this is IndieWebCamp, and this is about your IndieWebCamp user page, it should be about answering this question, continuously:
* '''What is the next thing you want to get working on your personal site?'''

This means for example that the following are better left out and pursued elsewhere - like on your own site!
* A personal to do list (of other non-personal-site things) - your IndieWebCamp user page is about work on your '''personal site'''.
* Asking others to do work for you. Note: requests for help with IndieWeb specific itches/projects are ok, but address them to everyone, not just individuals. This is about what '''you want to work on''' - not asking others to do work.
* Trying to get silos to do things, in general or with specific accounts - instead, document individual silo issues on the specific [[silo]] wiki pages, and follow-up there. Your itches should be about '''your personal site''', not silos.

=== Incremental Wikifying ===
{{main|expand a page}}
There's lots of incremental wikifying to help with.
* fixing typos
* adding IndieWeb Examples - if you find a page for a technology you support on your site, or a project you use on your site, add yourself to the "IndieWeb Examples" for that page
* add issues and questions (for FAQs)
* collect questions/answers from [[irc/today|IRC]] and add them to the appropriate wiki page
* organize the content of a growing page into sections per [[expand a page]]

=== New pages ===
{{main|start a page}}
There's lots of new page creation you can help with. Create new wiki pages for:
* new concepts or terms being discussed, e.g. in [[irc/today|IRC]]
** start with <nowiki>{{stub}}</nowiki> and a short definition!
* etherpads of notes from [[IndieWebCamp]] sessions after they're finished, to archive the session notes somewhere more findable / linkable
* new projects you start using on your personal website; be sure to include your site in the IndieWeb Examples section on the page.

=== Document your decisions ===
Once you've documented yourself on your User page, and started incrementally documenting your "Itches" and "Working On", as you get work done and deploy to your personal site, document your "major decisions", on your user page or perhaps in a "Implementation Design" section on your project page.

Examples:
* [[Falcon#Implementation_Design]] - major design decisions made in [[Falcon]] so far.

Documenting your major design and implementation decisions will help you better consider when to revisit them, and when to work on new personal site features and functionality instead.

=== Define jargon ===
Any time someone uses a jargon term in [[IRC]], or other indieweb related communications, go ahead and ask in the channel:
* <kbd>What is jargon term</kbd>
This will prompt [[Loqi]] to either answer with the definition with the wiki, or to prompt you to define it with a link to create the page on the wiki.

You can then define it by clicking on that link, or answer answer the what is question:
* <kbd>A jargon term is a specific unobvious concept, or re-use of a word to mean something other than its common meaning.</kbd>

Try to be specific and meaningful in definitions, and include why it is relevant to the indieweb (if that's not obvious from the description). 

Avoid repeating words from the term, avoid generic abstract definitions, and minimize use of jargon terms in a definition (though use them if necessary, and then link/define them too).

=== Tweetable definitions ===
Check the definitions on wiki pages, and edit them so they are tweetable, as there is evidence that people will tweet good definitions that are of tweetable length (including a subsequent link to the page) - that's 116 characters (space + 23 characters for the tco'd link).

** Note that he edited the dfn of [[site-deaths]] (as of that time) and removed "their" in order to make it fit on [[Twitter]].
