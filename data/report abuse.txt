'''<dfn>Report abuse</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>report inappropriate</dfn>) is a feature in many (most?) [[silos]] for notifying the silo owners that a specific user, [[post]], or [[comment]] is abusive. This feature is often provided to enable users to report [[spam]] on a silo.

Related but different features:
* [[mute]]
* [[block]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* no known examples of IndieWeb sites with a "report abuse" feature.

== Explicit Report Abuse Posts ==
There are some examples of people using posts themselves to report abuse with citable permalinks. E.g.
* https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl/status/540402809196146688

There is no known examples of silos which have an explicit ability to publish a "report abuse" post on its own permalink, and thus people are using other post types to do so, e.g. a [[note]].

==== Instagram User ====
On a '''user's "page"''' (e.g. in their iOS app), there is an action (http://www.human-friendly.com/assets/icons/action_icon-2da1ca4aa3599bbf453ba22a81c0e038.jpg) button on the top right, tapping it gives you:
* '''Block User''' menu item - which tapping it gives you an ('''Aside: might be worth moving this to [[block]]''')
** '''Are you sure?''' confirmation alert with buttons
** '''[Cancel] [Yes, I'm sure]''' 
** If you tap "Yes I'm sure", you got a confirmation alert saying 
*** '''User blocked''' with single button 
*** '''[Dismiss]'''
** afterwards the "Block User" item in the action button menu is now an
** '''Unblock User''' menu item - which tapping it gives you an 
** '''Are you sure?''' confirmation alert with buttons
** '''[Cancel] [Yes, I'm sure]''' 
** If you tap "Yes I'm sure", you got a confirmation alert saying 
*** '''User unblocked''' with single button 
*** '''[Dismiss]'''
** afterwards the "Block User" item in the action button menu is back as it was before.
* '''Report Inappropriate''' - if you tap this you get pop-up that overlays their entire UI with a
** '''[Cancel]''' button at the top left on a blue background, and in black/grey on light grey text below that, and a single tappable option below that: <blockquote>'''REPORT THIS ACCOUNT'''<br/>Why are you reporting this acccount?<br/><hr/>I believe this account violates Instagram's community guidelines</blockquote> Tapping that "I believe this ..." option
*** reveals a submenu of: <blockquote>Report a photo, video or comment &gt;<hr/>Report account  &gt;</blockquote> Tapping "Report account" then replaces the entire menu below the [Cancel] button with:
**** <blockquote>Posting annoying content<hr/>Posting spam<hr/>Posting inappropriate content<hr/>This profile is pretending to be someone else<hr/>Belongs to an underage child<hr/>Might be posting my intellectual property without authorization</blockquote> 
***** Tapping "Posting spam" replaces the [Cancel] button and overlay text with <br/>'''[Done]''' button at the top left on a blue background, and in black/grey on light grey text below that: <blockquote>'''THANK YOU'''<br/>Your reports help keep our community free of spam.</blockquote>
***** Tapping "This profile is pretending to be someone else" reveals a submenu of: <blockquote>Me &gt;<hr/>Someone I know &gt;<hr/>A celebrity or public figure &gt;</blockquote>

** '''Why are you reporting this comment?''' with menu items:
