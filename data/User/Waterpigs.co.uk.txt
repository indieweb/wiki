== Taproot ==

{{main|taproot}}

Taproot is the software I write for my personal site. It is not an open source product, I only named it for convenience (so others could refer to it by name rather than “that software Barnaby’s using”). Whilst the container is not open source, many of the components are, with more being extracted all the time.
