Yet another place I post on the world-wide-web. I've had a "personal home page" in some form or another since 1994, when I connected to the internet from an HP100LX Pocket PC with a 14K modem on a PC card. https://www.znmeb.mobi is the latest incarnation.

Projects:
Right now I'm doing the low-level stuff needed to make the site IndieWeb-friendly. It's a static site, hosted on Netlify and generated with RStudio / R Markdown.
