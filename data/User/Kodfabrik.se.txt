== Working on ==
Things I'm working on for IndieWebCamp and my own site.

=== [[webmention.herokuapp.com]]  ===
* Also known under the confusingly anonymous name of [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ "A WebMention Endpoint"]
* A hosted [[WebMention]] service for mainly static sites. Written in [[Node.js]].
* '''High level goal:''' Enable all sites to easily receive incoming [[interactions]] and mentions
* Used by me on [http://voxpelli.com/ voxpelli.com]
* [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/issues GitHub Issue Queue]

=== "A Micropub Endpoint" ===
* A hosted [[Micropub]] service for [[GitHub]] based static sites, mainly [[Jekyll]] ones. Written in [[Node.js]].
* '''High level goal:''' Lower threshold to publish to GitHub Pages-style sites by enabling them to take part in the [[Micropub]] ecosystem
* Used by me on [http://voxpelli.com/ voxpelli.com]
* Currently only the main building blocks have been open sourced: [https://github.com/voxpelli/node-micropub-express micropub-express], [https://github.com/voxpelli/node-format-microformat format-microformat] and [https://github.com/voxpelli/node-github-publish/ github-publish]

=== [[relspider]] ===
* An identity graph crawler
* '''High level goal:''' Enable everyone to easily discover all verified identities of an online web profile
** This means implementing many of the [[social graph]] features of the Google Social Graph API (but with no friend relations to limit the scope)
* [https://github.com/voxpelli/relspider/issues GitHub Issue Queue]

=== Community projects ===
* [[indie-config]] – continue to investigate, implement and discover new ways to develop it
* [[webactions]] – investigating ways to bundle it and [[indie-config]] into a reusable Web Component

== Wants to work on ==

* Getting a full IndieWeb POSSE-setup working for my Jekyll site. Some things remains:
** Demonstrate SWAT0 capabilities
** Automated WebMention sending
** Automated POSSE-syndication
** Brid.gy setup
** ...and probably more things I haven't thought about yet.
* Set up a persistent copy of [[relspider]] so me and others can easily query it for information about identities, something which may eg. contribute to [[indie-stats]]
* Create a complete Twitter/microblog-style client for the IndieWeb with full [[micropub]] and [[indie-reader]] capabilities – perhaps even including [[hashtags]]-like capabilities and search

== Indie web setup ==

I've two different main sites reflecting different parts of my online identity and showing it through different perspectives:

* http://kodfabrik.se – my professional profile, showing who I am as a web developer and giving people an easy point of contact. Also what I use as my OpenID URL and for my e-mail adress.
* http://voxpelli.com – my personal blog, where I share my thoughts around things and which could evolve into my IndieWeb-alternative to Twitter and such. Can currently recieve WebMentions and is marked up so that WebMentions can be manually sent from it.

My professional profile has been around for a long time – I don't change line of work every day and I don't change the name of my personal company every day so it's a very stable profile. Therefore it's very suitable for more critical applications like e-mail and OpenID.

My personal blog isn't a very good blog and has changed over the years. A good blog should ideally be focused around a specific subject, but mine while it is mainly web development posts isn't very focused and thus also doesn't get many posts. Ideally it would be replaced with a blog for each and every one of my interests, but right now it's mostly longer posts of the same stuff I post to Twitter and such and reflects as much of my identity as that does.

So – my stable online identity is my professional profile, but I don't hand business cards out to my friends and neither do I give them the link to my professional profile. But my blog which is personal isn't very good, very stable and will likely go through lots of iterations. It's also not what I hand to my professional contacts – them I hand my professional profile.

Which one is me? Both. Which one is most me? Both are part of me – neither reflects my identity completely, both reflects it in part. Therefore when someone asks me for my IndieWeb profile I can't give them just one URL but depending on the context I will give them a different URL. I'm still very open with them being the same identity, but I don't dress in shorts and hawaii shirts for important business meetings and I don't suit up to hang out with my family and I don't plan to change that in the IndieWeb world.
