<dfn>'''Jonny Barnes'''</dfn> is from Manchester, UK.

My indieweb site is at https://jonnybarnes.uk and runs on [http://laravel.com Laravel 5].

Currently I can [[POSSE]] my notes to [[Twitter]] and send [[webmentions]]. Though is limited to a “reply to” field. One thing to do is parse the notes for links and try sending webmentions to them.

I also have a contacts page. One thing this is used for is when I POSSE notes, locally I can have a nice [[h-card]] and then swap this for the relavent twitter handle when posting to twitter.

I also have micropub endpoint and my own client at https://jonnybarnes.uk/notes/new. I ''really'' need to cleanup the code to handle that.

The code is available at https://github.com/jonnybarnes/jbl5.
