Hi, I'm Sebastiaan and I'm a Dutch writer who nerds in his spare time, more and more turning into a nerd who used to write stories. I’ve got my own site since 2006 (I was 16 years old and blogged about… 16-stuff) and even before I knew about IndieWebCamp, I was thinking of making my Seblog into a social media hub. Finding IndieWebCamp is so nice… now I know that what I wanted is possible :)

== In the process of ==
* Well, let's start with the thing: I want to get my data to my own site:
** Twitter (already busy implementing / converting my archive)
** Facebook (I quitted 2014-09-06, but I have my archive downloaded and I'm thinking about making private posts of it, so I have all my data in the same format at the same place, but not necessarily public to all)
** Instagram (shouldn't be that hard?)
** Blog archive (I've been blogging since 2006 [again, I was 16]. I want that data back on my site as well, but maybe marked private, like with my Facebookposts. My site used to run on a homemade thing, then Wordpress, then homemade again, and now I'm running on .txt files with Kirby. I want those different archives together, public or partly private, but in one place.)
** Hyves (Dutch social network, was quite big, but then came Facebook. Luckly I downloaded all my data. Some of the data is actually older than my weblog, but still, maybe post it there?)
** Misc. (Sometimes you post things on different places around the internet… I want to grab everything I can find and copy it :) )
* Then, I also want all those cool things like likes and reply's and webmentions working. I already had them working, but then I changed my thoughts on URL-design…

== Itches ==

Here are some of the topics I am thinking about or want to think more about. And eventually do something about. About, that’s what it’s about.

=== Private / Public posting ===

As I mentioned earlier, I want my archives on one place. (And have a back up somewhere, but still: one archive.) But: not everything in my archive should be public available. I could mark things as private and thus only show it in the backend, but it would be nice if there was a way to share it with certain people. I saw some articles about this on this wiki. But this is something I want to work on / think about.

=== Multi-topic ===

This is me, thinking about the reader.

Blogging guru's say you have to pick a topic and then make interesting content for an audience. It was my excuse to quit blogging all together. But I kept posting on Facebook, little things about daily life, because that seemed to be a more appropriate place for it. Then I freaked out about the platform and left.

I still want to share little stories. But I also want to share more serious stuff. The difference between social media and a blog. How can I put everything in to one archive, but still be able to tell an interesting story with that data / those posts for the reader? That’s a question to work on for me.

=== Multi-lingual ===

When I start with IndieWeb, I have a topic to write about in English. I like that. But all my posts so far are in Dutch. I also have some basic knowledge about a few other European languages and I’m now quite seriously learning Japanese. I actually have some Japanese blogposts over on Lang-8.com. What to do with those? And what to do with possible future English posts?

This boils down to a similar point as the previous one: how do I get multiple languages on my site, while still maintaining user experience.


== My username is a hashtag ==

I don’t know if this is the place to document this kind of stuff, so I think I’ll write a blogpost about it and link it here. Basicly: I’m @sebsel for quite some time now, but a Turkish (tv-series?) couple (Şebnem and Selin) are quite often refered to as #sebsel. I get mentions from time to time and every possible variation on my username is taken on Instagram.

Maybe I should change that silly name, but it's short and short is hard to come by these days. It's a nice question: how much identity gives a username like that, if someone can turn it into a hashtag and flood you away? (Okay, it's not thát bad yet, but imagine Justin Bieber doing this.)
