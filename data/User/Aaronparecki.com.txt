== indieweb support ==
See [[p3k]]

== working on ==
I'm working on building the following [[building-blocks|building blocks]] of the Indie Web
* [[webmention]]
* [[indieauth]]
* [[micropub]]

I'm building indieweb functionality into my personal site, [[p3k]]

== figured out ==
Things I feel like I've figured out pretty well, have shipped on my own site, can depend on, and am available to help explain to others.
* [[POSSE]], in particular
** [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSE to Twitter]]
* [[webmention]] and [[pingback]]

== itching ==
Below are some general itches that are before the stage of turning into action items for [[p3k]]. For a more immediate list of things that will end up in my site, see: [[p3k#Itching]]

* private groups - wanting to communicate privately with some group of people. This past year I have been finding private/secret Facebook groups very useful for certain things. How does this translate onto our individual sites?
* archive to wayback machine
** some time after publishing posts on my site, send a ping to the wayback machine to trigger archiving it
** send a ping for any pages that I link to
* community event calendar/aggregator
* gopher server for IndieNews as a follow-up to http://metatalk.metafilter.com/24019/Direct-your-gopher-client-to-gopher-gophermetafiltercom
