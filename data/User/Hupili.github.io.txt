It just come to me that an independent domain is not mandatory....
Anyway, it's beneficial to have more people own there domain. 

The IndieAuth facility is cool. I very like the integration of Google Authenticator! This is really a good '''One Time Password (OTP)''' solution. Now I can login and contribute to this wiki on any computers without worrying loss of personal credentials!

Good work!

Let me link back to my major account: http://hupili.net 

We can really make it easier for people to show up on IndieWebCamp:

* Find any content hosting services. (not over-emphasize the importance of independent domain '''at the first place''')
* Set up [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain]]
* Encourage people to show up on the wiki. e.g. edit an user page. 

Not everyone can contribute a lot, but we can make it easier to get more people together.
