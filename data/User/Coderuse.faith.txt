I've just started to build my blog [http://coderuse.faith CodeRuse]. This blog is hosted on [https://pages.github.com/ GitHub Pages]. Built on [https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines Bitbucket Pipelines]. Built by using [https://jekyllrb.com/ Jekyll]. A modified version of [http://github.com/heiswayi/textlog TextLog] has been used as theme. Domain purchased on [https://www.namecheap.com/ namecheap], with a discounted price of just $5.88 for 5 years. Probably after five years, I have to shift to another domain, as the renewal price is too big. $25 per year. Using [https://www.cloudflare.com/ Cloudflare] as the DNS host for faster DNS resolution.

I'm trying to make it IndieWeb compatible as far as possible for a personal blog. Later I'll add the setup instructions in this page.
