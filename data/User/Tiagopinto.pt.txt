Rails developer by day, iOS developer by night, sysadmin and dbadmin when needed.

Currently living in London, UK. Previously in Lisbon, Portugal and Coimbra, Portugal.

Personal website: [[http://www.tiagopinto.pt/ tiagopinto.pt]], currently a static web site served directly by Amazon S3. Thinking about something a bit more dynamic.
Goals: have everything created to date under my domain e.g. Webisodes and Podcast.
