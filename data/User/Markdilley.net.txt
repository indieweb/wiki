I had trouble loggin in to this wiki, even though I have added my openid to my domain, got to an unmanageable screen that would not let me login until I tried the login with OpenID account info and got this crappy account name.  If you have the rename account extension here - please update my account to 'MarkDilley' - thanks.  Mark

Checking back in... any rename extension here?
