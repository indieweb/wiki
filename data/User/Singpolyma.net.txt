My site currently powered by WordPress + Diso Extended Profile + Diso Actionstream + Webmention + PubSubHubBub + Semantic Linkback

I post articles and notes (either of which can also be a reply and can also include an image), with an articles-only feed (https://singpolyma.net/feed/) and a notes-only feed (https://singpolyma.net/feed/action_stream/?user=2&full&include%5B%5D=microblog) and a feed of all my activity (which includes some stuff I back-feed from places like Reddit and Github: https://singpolyma.net/feed/action_stream/?user=2&full) and well as other feeds that are not PuSH enabled.

I accept replies to my posts through Pingpack, Webmention, an on-site UI, and Salmon.

I'm interested in getting the whole social web linked up.  That means brid.gy is one of my favourite things.  It also means I try to contribute patches to GNUsocial/RedMatrix/Frendica/etc to make them talk to each other and to indiewebbers more easily.  It also means I'll often push to re-used existing tech over the normal re-invent-everything philosophy most communities seem to have.
