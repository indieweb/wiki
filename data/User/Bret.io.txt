='''<span class="h-card">[http://bret.io/ Bret Comnes]</span>'''=

A directory of my indieweb interests, projects, and events.  I am interested in projects that are low maintenance and long term in scope, p2p and distributed storage systems and anything else that makes publishing easy and fun.

== Itching ==
Small modules to power a personal site engine.  No spaghetti code.  Pure and separate plain text (eg twitter style), GHF Commonmark, and plain html documents inserted into DSL free html templates. Plain text + git storage engine.

Optional static site generation or dynamic server side rendering.

Data stored in a manner that lends itself to incremental rebuilds.

Fix up git pub and experiment with accepting JSON encoded micropub reqs.

Improve slides tooling: https://github.com/bcomnes/slides

== Current IndieWeb Projects ==
* [https://github.com/bcomnes/base base] (working title) - A starter indieweb template for Jekyll.
* [http://bret.io bret.io] - my personal website.  Hosted on [[gh-pages]] and rendered in [[jekyll]] safe mode. [https://github.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io source]
** [[jekyll]] - Contributing and extending Jekyll's indieweb capabilities. 
** Graceful note enhancement using metadata presence 
* [[gitpub]] - A publishing endpoint for static websites.  Still experimental.  Supports micropub clients. [https://github.com/bcomnes/gitpub source]
** Working on Features: 
** Auto POSSE to twitter
** Configuration UI
* Experimenting with [[camlistore]], [[git-annex]], [[bittorrent-sync]], and [[telehash]].
* [[socialwg]] - participating in the w3c social WG/IG as an invited expert (applied).

== Stalled & Completed Projects ==
* [http://iwc-log-feed.herokuapp.com iwc-irc-logs-atom-feed] - A simple project that turns the IWC IRC logs into a daily atom feed item so you can cache the logs for offline consumption on a mobile reader.  Still needs a system to update consistently and to match the recent IRC display improvements. [https://github.com/bcomnes/iwc-log-feed code]
* [https://github.com/bcomnes/webmention.js webmention.js] - Displays data from [[webmention.io]] on a static site with javascript using jsonp.  Needs some work.  See [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com] for a more functional and documented project currently.  I'll return to this someday, but a broken version is running on my personal site currently.
