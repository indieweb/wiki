== Areas of Interest ==
Syndication feeds (RSS/Atom); Activity Streams; mashups; data ownership; user-sovereignty.

== Working On ==
* [https://github.com/lmorchard/feeder2 feeder2] - Latest attempt at a web feed poller & general node.js saw-sharpening

== Thinking about ==
* Simple static web hosting service
** No smarts, no structure beyond URLs. Put this content at that URL under my (sub)domain.
** Like Amazon S3 but with a non-horrible on-ramp
** Like Dropbox but specifically for scalable web hosting
** Like remoteStorage but (again) specifically for web hosting
** Simple API with Oauth(ish?) permission dance for apps

== Itches ==
* lmorchard.com hasn't got respectable SSL

== Mothballed ==
''Used to work on these things. I stopped. Might start again, someday. Then again, maybe not.''
