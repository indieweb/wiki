Known as mlncn most places online.

Justice, liberty, and the self-organization we need for both drive me to support authentic news, especially public interest sources, such as http://binjonline.org/ most recently.  Using Free Software, mostly Drupal and Django, the other members of Agaric - http://agaric.com - a worker-owned, cooperatively-run company, and I build web sites with Free Software. I helped form a nonprofit organization called, by, and for, People Who Give a Damn.  Some time pretty soon PWGD will finally get around to building tools to give equal access to, and control of, communication to everybody.  Sign up at http://pwgd.org to get updates on when we can see our visions unite unmediated, perchance to become collective action.
