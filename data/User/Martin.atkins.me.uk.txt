Martin Atkins has [http://martin.atkins.me.uk/ a portfolio site] that doubles as an [[IndieAuth]] identity, and [http://apparently.me.uk/ a tech blog]. Both are generated by home-grown software and hosted on Github pages at the time of writing, but the source code of that software is not currently open source, largely because it's a mess and not something worthy of anyone else's eyes. However, it is descended from the (also sub-awesome) software behind [http://urbanscars.com/ Urban Scars], which [https://github.com/apparentlymart/urbanscars *is* publicly visible].

Martin previously worked on [[OpenID]] and [[ActivityStreams]] but has done nothing of any indie web value for some time. Maybe that will change at some point.
