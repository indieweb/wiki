My name is gRegor Morrill and I have been blogging on my domain since about 2002. [[PHP]] is my primary programming language, but I would like to branch out into [[Python]] to broaden my experience.

I helped start the Chicago chapter of the [[Homebrew Website Club]] and enjoyed attending IndieWebCamp [[2014|Portland 2014]] and [[2015]].

== Contributions ==
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/ProcessWire-Webmention Webmention module] for [[ProcessWire]]
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention Webmention plugin] for [[Nucleus]] CMS

== My site ==
I was using [[Nucleus]] CMS on my site from 2002 until 2015. The extensibility of it attracted me and served me well for a long time. I contributed to the Nucleus core code and several plugins over the years. I implemented a [[webmention]] plugin [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention] and a plugin for posting [[notes]]. Unfortunately, official development has stopped. After using the [[ProcessWire]] framework professionally for several sites, I migrated my site to that in 2015.

Here are some notes on my implementations:

* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/webmention|webmention implementation]]
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes|notes implementation]]

== Goals ==
* Have my site migrated to [[ProcessWire]] and my ProcessWire Webmention+Vouch plugin released by [[2015|2015 IndieWebCamp Portland]]
** I was able to migrate to ProcessWire '''at''' IndieWebCamp Portland and am using the plugin currently, but it is not released yet. ''Whoa-oh, we're halfway there!''

== Interests ==
In no particular order, I am interested in:
* Fix de-duplication of received webmentions, specifically for Bridgy. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-03-18#t1426709353984]
* Adding a "notes" stream to my site distinct from the articles.
** Setting up distinct, well-designed presentations for different types of notes (e.g. quotes, links, status update, video), a la Tumblr
* Caching webmention author photos locally
** Avoid breaking images when a Twitter user changes their avatar
** Be able to deliver all images over https, even if the author's site does not support it.
* Syndicating notes/articles to Twitter and Facebook ([[POSSE]])
* Coming up with a better acronym than "POSSE." It sounds silly. ;)
* <strike>Adding SSL.</strike> Migrate all content to SSL-only. Secure all the things! ''Damn the Man''
** SSL support added 2014-07-08. Content is still available on both http and https
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/webmention#Todo|Webmention to-do]] list
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes#Todo|Notes to-do]] list
* Work on [[media_checkin]]s for books I'm reading and music I'm listening to, perhaps others.
** I particularly enjoy using [[Goodreads.com]] currently to track my reading progress. Would like to do that on my site and cross-post there, instead.
* Tweak new wiki theme
* Set up [[checkins]], display maps with OpenStreetMap
* Set up [[micropub]]
* Work on a simple [[HWC]] graphic for use on event posts (specifically on Facebook)
* Publish [[like]]s or — more likely (no pun intended) — favorites/stars.
** Optionally display them on a dedicated page, sorted by most recently starred.
** Optionally allow sorting the starred item's original publish date.
* Better logging of incoming webmentions, including: request headers, webmentions originating from the form on my site.
* Add a hook to the Wayback Machine's "Save Page Now" after posting an article.
** Per tantek's suggestion, probably after a 24hr delay, to allow time for corrections. http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-11-21#t1416613576792
* Set up a [[sitemap]] at gregorlove.com/42
* Sift through my old [[OPML]] file and set up a [[following]] page.
* Archive Flickr photos on my own site.
* POSSE to Flickr
* Work on upgrading h2vx.com with mf2 support.
* Cache [[Bridgy]] Publish webmention endpoint to speed up cross-posting to Twitter; timing out a lot on my site currently.
* Update [[PuSH]] support
** Automate ping for articles.atom feed
** Add automatic ping for /notes/ feed.

=== Completed ===
* '''2015-11-10:''' Setting up PGP ''securely''. Again, Damn the Man.
* '''2015-09-30:''' Post events on my own site
* '''2015-08-17:''' Cache article/note permalinks and /archives page
* '''2015-07-27:''' Displaying webmention replies on notes like I do on articles.
* '''2015-07-12:'''
** Migrated my site from Nucleus to ProcessWire. See [[User:Gregorlove.com/Changing permalinks|Changing permalinks]]
** Update site layout to be responsive.
** Add note content/summary to <title> on note permalinks.
** Queue sending webmentions so the posting UI does not hang
* '''2015-03-22:'''
** Added character count to notes interface to gauge Twitter limit, using [[CASSIS]]
** Added query parameter support for in-reply-to URL, so now I can reply to tweets from Android more easily using https://snarfed.org/easy-indieweb-interactions-on-android
* '''2015-02-11:''' Migrate RSS feed ''away'' from [[FeedBurner]]
* '''2014-06-29:''' Help [[User:Amandamaclean.com|Amanda MacLean]] get set up posting on her own domain at [[2014|IndieWebCamp West 2014]]
** Set up a basic, custom CMS using [[ProcessWire]] at http://battlestaramandica.amandamaclean.com

== Braindump ==
* Help decrease jargon/improve usability.
** E.g. Review/improve [[WordPress#Themes]] so we can point to 'install this theme, this plugin, and start posting'
