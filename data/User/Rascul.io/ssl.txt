Here I will describe my SSL setup for https://rascul.io.

== Basics ==
https://rascul.io runs on [[Nginx]] with a certificate from https://startssl.com. I have received high scores from [https://ssllabs.com SSL Labs] which can be viewed at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=rascul.io.

== Configuration ==

=== Nginx Configuration ===
Below is my SSL/HTTPS related configuration found in the http block of nginx.conf for https://rascul.io. More information about them might be found at http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html.

 http {
     # Prefer server ciphers over client ciphers, which hopefully will make use of
     # the stronger ciphers I've selected over potentially weaker ciphers the
     # browser might specify.
     ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
     
     # This list of ciphers is the strongest available that I've been able to come
     # up with which support forward secrecy and are compatible with as many clients
     # as possible.
     ssl_ciphers kECDHe+AES:EECDH+AESGCM:EECDH+AES256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA;
     
     # SSLv3 is required in order to support Java6 with this configuration.
     # But we don't want SSL at all because of poodle.
     # All other clients should be using TLS.
     ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;
     
     # Share the session cache between all worker processes.
     ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
     
     # Sessions last for 10 minutes (default is five minutes).
     ssl_session_timeout 10m;
     
     # File containing DH Parameters, used for ECHDE ciphers. To create the file: 
     # openssl dhparam -outform pem -out dhparam4096.pem 4096
     ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/dhparam4096.pem;
 }

=== Host Specific Configuration ===
This is the host specific configuration, I keep it in the file /etc/nginx/sites-available/rascul.io and it is symlinked to /etc/nginx/sites-enables/rascul.io. Only the SSL/HTTPS related directives are included here.

 server {
     # Apply these directives to HTTP on port 80. Basically all I'm doing here is
     # forcing the connection to HTTPS on port 443.
     listen 80;
     
     # rascul.io will never support a www subdomain.
     server_name rascul.io;
     
     # A 301 redirect to force https.
     return 301 https://$host$request_uri;   
 }
 
 server {
     # Support connections with SSL and SPDY.
     listen 443 ssl spdy;
     
     # Once again, rascul.io will never support a www subdomain.
     server_name rascul.io;
     
     # Use HSTS to specify rascul.io should be connected to via HTTPS only.
     add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000";
     
     # Announce SPDY support (check spdy at https://spdycheck.org)
     add_header Alternate-Protocol 443:npn-spdy/3,443:npn-spdy/2;
     
     # Compress SPDY headers
     spdy_headers_comp 6;
     
     # Enable SSL for this server.
     ssl on;
     
     # Certificate chain. The format is described in the nginx documentation:
     # http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate
     ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/rascul.io/ssl-unified.crt;
     
     # Specify the private key for rascul.io. Remember to ensure permissions and 
     # ownership of the private key are restrictive.
     ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/rascul.io/ssl.key;
     
     # Enable stapling of OSCP responses by the server.
     ssl_stapling on;
     
     # Verify OSCP responses.
     ssl_stapling_verify on;
     
     # Trusted CA certificates used for OSCP. Once again, refer to nginx docs:
     # http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_trusted_certificate
     ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/rascul.io/trustchain.crt;
 }
