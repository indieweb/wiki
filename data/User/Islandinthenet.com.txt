Hello, I’m Khürt L. Williams. I’m an information security professional, web developer, avid photographer, and technology geek. I’m also a craft ale and coffee fanatic. The <span class="h-card">[https://islandinthenet.com Island in the Net]</span> weblog is where I share my incoherent and random thoughts and rants about technology and photography geekery, coffee, craft ale, diabetes, and life. That’s me in the image above, enjoying a sunrise near Carnegie Lake, Princeton, New Jersey.
