The [http://aaronparecki.com/Loqi bot] in the IRC channel can control lights in the house, do text to speech on computers inside the house, shows Twitter mentions and wiki edits, do unit conversion and other calculations, manage a "todo" list, and sometimes makes snarky remarks.

Its modular structure has made it extremely easy to quickly add new functionality, and as such, has probably slowed Aaron's development on other more accessible web-based equivalents.

== other ==
Here's where all other indieweb/FSW related projects go, including / especially those which are:
* not used by any IndieWebCamp participants
* or maybe just a spec (no code)
Despite their disused or theoretical nature, we may still be able to learn from the strengths and weaknesses of other approaches, document formats/protocols etc. and try to merge efforts.

=== Diaspora ===
{{main|Diaspora}}

[[Diaspora]] is an open source project for hosting a social network on your own server that [[federates]] with other Diaspora instances, which are called "pods". 

No IndieWeb community members are currently using it on their own site.

=== Ghost ===
{{main|Ghost}}

Ghost is an "idealistic and fictional concept for a WordPress-lite fork"[http://john.onolan.org/ghost/] that is [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/widget/video.html seeking funding through kickstarter].

No IndieWeb community members are using it on their own site.

=== GNU social ===
{{main|GNU social}}

GNU social is an open source project that "will be a decentralized social network that you can install on your own server".

No IndieWeb community members are using it on their own site.

=== OStatus for WordPress ===
[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ostatus-for-wordpress/ OStatus for WordPress] is a collection of plugins to make WordPress blogs followable by status.net and other OStatus instances.

No IndieWeb community members are using it on their own site.

If we could get indie web participation by some folks using OStatus, it would be great to understand how well it works today.

=== Postcard ===
[http://www.postcardsocial.net Postcard] is an iOS app that allows you to post content on multiple social networks. It lets one network serve as the 'host' and the remaining networks share a link back to it.

The Postcard API Protocol also allows the app to communicate with your own site. A WordPress plugin that implements this API has been released along with the iOS app.

=== Shaarli ===
[http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli Shaarli] is a minimalist [[delicious]] clone you can install on your own website. It is designed to be personal (single-user), fast, and handy.

It is primarily a bookmarking application, but the feature list indicates you can also ". . . use it for micro-blogging (like Twitter), a pastebin, an online notepad, a snippet repository, etc."

IndieWeb community members who are using it on their own site:
* [[User:Upon2020.com|Johannes Ernst]] is using it since he moved from delicious.com, and he's not looking back!
* [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]] is interested in trying this out testing its use for micro-blogging.

===Tent.io===
{{main|Tent.io}}
* http://tent.io suite of distributed networking protocols, alternative to OStatus
** sample instance running at http://tent.is

No IndieWeb community members are using it on their own site.

===Indie Box Project===
http://indieboxproject.org/ management software that allows the simple administration of indie web sites on cheap Linux devices and plug computers.

Used by:
* [[User:Upon2020.com|Johannes Ernst]] is using it at home for web applications used by his family. Those include OwnCloud, Shaarli, Selfoss, Wordpress, and some home-grown ones.

== abandoned ==
These are projects that indiewebcamp participants or community members added to the projects page, but now appear abandoned for the time being.  A temporary lapse or were more fundamental mistakes made?  Perhaps victims of [[antipatterns]]?  No matter the reason, what can we learn from these examples?  If you are the creator of one of these projects, what can you do to prevent ending up in the abandoned section and revive the project?  

=== Federated Community ===
The idea here is to use pop-based email, generic python scripting, and static html to set up a dynamic microblogging and photohosting site. Current workflow includes sending an email to a pop email account. Then when the python script finds the new email it downloads the email to my static html server and also sends out an email to my facebook and twitter accounts for syndication. Currently, the python script is located [https://github.com/geo-gs/federatedcommunity/tree/python here] and an example of the static html is located [https://github.com/geo-gs/gcarlson.github.com here]. Next up is adding in the ability to upload photo albums. After that, comments.

=== glow ===
[http://blog.glow.io glow] (last post 2011-07-12 advises using G+) supports integrations with Twitter and Facebook and a complete stack of federated social web protocols and standards (activitystrea.ms, poco, pubsubhubub, salmon, etc). 

Glow is currently limited to glow.io subdomains if you want to try it out. At some point it will likely be opened it up to any host/domain.

Folks that were using it on their own site:
* [[User:DBounds|Darren Bounds]] (http://dbounds.glow.io/profile (connection has timed out), author of glow)
* ...

Other instances / earlier work:
* <span id="ooava"><nowiki>http://ooava.com/</nowiki></span> (domain abandoned) was a personal project social node for publishing (photos, videos, status updates) and conversation on the web and Android. ooava was a personal site that evolved into the glow project.

== About This Page ==
The [[projects]] page is focused on providing a clear flat list of projects you can set up on your own site to join the indie web.

Some design thinking for this page. 
* Project inclusion requirements:
** indieweb community adoption and active use 
** [[selfdogfood]]
* Project ordering criteria:
** 1. What can I setup right now to '''get on''' the indieweb?
** Prefer community member maintained projects over general tools
** 2. What projects have '''inspiring''' indieweb examples? E.g.
*** Have reasonably nice looking home page and permalinks
*** Then ordered by apparent (actual in use) IndieMark level
* Each project listing should:
** list a few (1-3 max) indieweb examples actively using the project
*** Full list of active users on the actual project page
** preferably exemplary - i.e. of high [[IndieMark]]
** "tour-worthy" - sites you'd want to show someone new to the indieweb as clear examples of appealing / useful / empowering indieweb sites.
** at least 1 selfdogfood example of (most) primary project developer
* Sections
** Get rid of release vs experimental vs. etc. This distinction was useful originally, but now # of active indieweb users acts as a better evaluation of project usability/usefulness. Many "experimental" projects are more useful/usable and advancing faster than officially released/stable projects.
** Primary indieweb site software (e.g. Known, p3k, Publify, Taproot, Ferocity, Falcon)
** Service hubs / proxies (e.g. webmention.io, brid.gy)

=== Formerly ===
Split into production, experimental, hacks, and explorations as well as other for projects that are or appear to be IndieWeb related but are either not in use by any attendee or status is unknown.

Within each quality level the projects are listed by:
* Primary blogging / content hosting systems listed first, additional content hosting systems (e.g. for a specific content type only), and then other useful indieweb building block projects.
* Then by # of IndieWebCamp participants + other independents using each project.

Sorted within each quality level by number of IndieWebCamp participants actively using it on their primary self-identity site (thus you can quickly see which projects are the most "real", in-use, and likely well supported).

See also offsite:
* [http://libreprojects.net Libre Projects] - usable, hosted, open source web software
* [https://github.com/indieweb github.com/indieweb organization] - repositories related to the indieweb. Once Mime adds [[2012/Guest_List|2012 participants]] to the organization, we'll be able to fork our projects to it so we can all follow each others' progress!


=== experimental ===
Stuff that you've at least got running on your own site, but is perhaps not stable/reliable enough for general sharing / use by others. Still useful to document what you *do* have running and use, share some of the code/design/UX, and lessons learned. Roughly ordered first by how "complete" the blogging/posting functionality is with known (URL required) attendee users, then other content tools, and other building blocks.

Experimental blogging / content hosting projects sorted by number of indieweb community members actively using them on their own primary personal site (and then alphabetically).

==== [[Unhosted]] ====
* The idea here is to use statically hosted MVC apps and projects like [[remotestorage.io]] + local browser storage as a way to write applications that can work offline and edit data stored on the web.
* Michiel B. de Jong uses a [https://github.com/michielbdejong/resite webserver] pointed at his remotestorage files to host his [https://michielbdejong.com/ website].
