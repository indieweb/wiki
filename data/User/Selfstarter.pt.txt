== Thoughts and Ideas ==
I do want to make my own thing but can't start on it just yet. Hoping I can help onboard non-IndieWebbers and then with the weaning process from WordPress to other projects for now. 

I would love to set up an IndieWebCamp / meet-up in Birmingham, I'll try and get in touch soon to find out as much info as I can.
