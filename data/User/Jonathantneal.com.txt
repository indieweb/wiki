== working on ==
Something indieweb related. Something to do with simplifying and centralizing the socially interactive IndieWeb experience across multiple websites.

He definitely needs encouragement. Or friends.

== speaking engagements ==
My schedule is full, as my wife and I discuss things ''quite'' often. Despite inconclusive gender stereotypes, my speeches fill any time slot, and she is rather to the point.

== philosophy ==

My decisions are liberal. My words are conservative. My thoughts are private.

To which I may add; my actions are flawed, my heart is big, and at some I switched to first person.
