My reasoning for the indieweb:
[https://petermolnar.eu/journal/indieweb-decentralize-web-centralizing-ourselves/ Indieweb â€“ decentralize the web while centralizing ourselves]

Just like {{bear}} I can help with (linux) system questions, in case they are listed in the following tag cloud: lxc, syncthing, bitlbee, znc, tinyproxy, ssl, postfix, dovecot, opendmarc, opendkim, nginx, php(-fpm), ssh, mysql/percona, collectd, monit, rsyslog, luks, fail2ban, iptables, ansible, debian, centos, raspbian. 

== projects == 

* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] - an alternative webmentions plugin for WordPress
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/blogroll2email Blogroll2email]- turns the Blogroll part of WordPress to feed (atom, rss, mf2) parser to send entries as mail; supports [[granary]] json-mf2 format
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-shortslug wp-shortslug] - use pubdate epoch converted to base36 (0-9a-z) as short permalink
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-flatbackups wp-flatbackups ] - an auto-exporter for WordPress, creating a flat, directory based copy of YAML + Markdown (and/or HTML) of every post. This can't be imported, just servers as a fallback plan for [[longevity]].
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-peoplemention wp-peoplemention] - a plugin that adds a taxonomy for posts to store usernames and URLs; these usernames are matched against the content and sends a webmention to the corresponding URL
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-url2snapshot wp-url2snapshot] - to have a backup copy of a linked website, the plugin pulls in an html-only version of every link it can find in any post content and stores it for potential future use. In case a link is not snapshotted yet and is not available on the web anymore, it tries to fall back to the last available version on archive.org.
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/petermolnar.eu petermolnar.eu]  - my own theme (with some things that should be in plugins), using [[Twig]] as template engine. It also makes purifications and tunes on WordPress for the sake of sanity.


== website setup ==

https://petermolnar.eu is powered by WordPress with a "bit" of customization.

* all posts are in Markdown ( the TinyMCE editor is turned off, the posts are not stored in HTML and the conversion is on the fly, using [http://parsedown.org/extra/ Parsedown Extra]).
* built-in post formats are replaced with own setup of types ( e.g customizable post formats ), and this is detected and set automatically
* categories are still used for structural organization ( e.g topics )
* tags are used as tags
* the site uses [https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-webmention-again wp-webmention-again] for sending and receiving webmentions
* for storing outgoing: every post can have a "mentioned url" post meta, alongside with the type (reply, repost, like ) and (optional) rsvp data; this link is matched agains supported silos and auto-sent to [https://github.com/petermolnar/bridgy-publish Bridgy Publish] (for the original plugin, credits go to {{gwg}} for publish ( this is when replying to tweets are happening, for example, one less box to check )
* comments are checked against parent comment urls; if possible, they try to send webmention for the parent; this is in case I reply to an incoming reply with a comment in case of a new post

== Inactive/on hold  ==
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/wordpress-playlistlog Playlistlog], a last.fm archive importer and [http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/protocol/ Audioscrobbler Protocol 1.2] reciver to store and receive all the played entries a client sends to - currently on hold due to lack of interest and the fact that the options WP has might not be the best to sort this data
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring-reactions-importer Keyring Social Importers] a reactions (like, fav, comment, etc ) importer for various silos

== POSSE ==
[[Category:POSSE_Flickr]]
[[Category:POSSE_Twitter]]
[[Category:POSSE_Facebook]]

For Flickr, I use [http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wordpress/ Social Networks Auto Poster], for everything else, [[bridgy]]. The reason for this separation is that access to my original sized photos are limited and restricted and I want to push the full size to Flickr.

I mostly stopped syndicating to silos, except for special occasions and things I need to push there for people living there. I took me a very long time to do so, and I still haven't deleted my accounts in most of the silos. In case you have too much time and/or interested in my reasons:

* [https://petermolnar.eu/journal/exodus Exodus]
* [https://petermolnar.eu/journal/i-want-the-blogs-back I want the blogs back]
* [https://petermolnar.eu/journal/after-facebook enough]

== Backfeed ==

I used to do this with [https://github.com/petermolnar/keyring-reactions-importer Keyring-Reactions-Importer], but I've recently moved to [[bridgy]] and I'm quite happy with it. Much more reliable, even if I depend on an external service now.

== Reader ==

I've been using RSS for about 10 years now and old habits die hard. For years I had [http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001148 rss2email] to do the polling but lately I've made [https://wordpress.org/plugins/blogroll2email/ blogroll2email], which reactivates the fairly forgotten Blogroll section of WordPress as a feed reader (rss, atom & mf2) and sends the articles as email.

== own your data ( and the responsibility ) ==

Eons ago ( as in internet-eons, so ~16 years ) I FTPd my first static site to a free hosting provider ( long dead since ). Due to being inexperienced and due to the lack of generic computing knowledge, I'd never heard of version controlling that time, so up until 2002, all my changes were lost. I only realized this somewhere around 2014, when I decided to rake every single content I ever did together, and to be honest, it's not a good feeling to realize there is no way to get that content back, ever.

Since '99, lots of things had changed, and for a little while, I offered hosting solutions myself. That required hosting all the actual web stack, including, for example, mail. This resulted that even today I'm running my own mail stack, and despite the growing number of insane security loops needs implementing, I want to keep it that way. I can do backups of everything, and if I lose my website, I'm sad; but if I can't access my mailing, I'm going to lose much more. I'm not willing to take chances of Google locking me out from my own account suddenly, or a random provider accidentally loosing 10+ years of mails. If I lose it, it's my fault. 

I know many who are not willing to take responsibility of hosting their own stuff - "it's too much trouble". In this era of computing, it's really not, if you're a power user, it shouldn't even take long - but then you'd need to take responsibility for it, which, I believe, the real problem is.

Don't be afraid of owning your web presence.
