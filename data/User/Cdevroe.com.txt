== My "skills" ==
Consider this term loosely used. Though I'm stubborn enough to keep at something until I figure it out.
* Programming (PHP, JavaScript, a few other languages)
* Front-end coding (HTML, JavaScript)
* I'm a sucker for nomenclature, taxonomy, folksonomy
* Do not ask me CSS questions.
