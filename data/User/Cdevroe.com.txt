== My indie web ==
I'm just getting set up. My personal site is marked up with h-feed and h-entry so far. But I plan on doing everything on the itches list soon enough.

== Itches I'm planning to scratch ==
These are some of the things I'm working on with regards to my indieweb setup.


# Adding Indie Web building blocks to my site
## Posts (notes, articles)
### Hashtags
## Web Mentions

== My "skills" ==
Consider this term loosely used. Though I'm stubborn enough to keep at something until I figure it out.
* Programming (PHP, JavaScript, a few other languages)
* Front-end coding (HTML, JavaScript)
* I'm a sucker for nomenclature, taxonomy, folksonomy
* Do not ask me CSS questions.
