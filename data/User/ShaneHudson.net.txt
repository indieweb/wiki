Hey, I'm <span class="h-card">[https://shanehudson.net/ Shane Hudson]</span>

This page is [https://shanehudson.net/itch duplicated] from my own website.

== Working on ==
I have recently moved my website from using [[WordPress]] to [[Craft]]. The migration is mostly complete, but I have plenty to implement.

== Implemented ==
* [[webmentions]]
* [[fragmentions]]
* Multiple post types. I currently have: Articles (longform), Notes (short) and Links (bookmarks) inheriting from a 'Post' section and I also have: Webmentions and Comments inheriting from an 'Interactions' section.
* Storing geolocation of notes
* Reached level 5 on [[HTTPS]]
* As of 2014/09/19 I now have POSSE to Twitter working on Craft. It has a on/off switch with a text box for the tweet. Currently I have to paste the main text into the tweet text box but eventually will make it automatic, this way it allows 140+ characters in the notes but not tweets. I have reply contexts working but have to manually grab the ID, and I want to add photo uploads.
* As of 2014/09/22 I've now got the ability to relate notes to collections, currently it is specifically for books but it will not be hard to improve the functionality for multiple types of collection.


== Itches ==
* <strike>Quite often I want to post lots of small notes about the same thing, as writing a long article about it would often get left for later. So I want another post type, called something like 'Object' so that I can store entities that I write notes about. A working use-case for this is Mandy Brown's website where she has [http://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/shape-of-design/ books that have multiple notes attached to them].</strike>
* Do something with the geolocation
* I think I have a bug with sending webmentions, which I need to look into
* I don't like link rot, so I would like to automatically backup pages that I link to with a manual (could be automatic but not really needed) checkbox for showing/hiding the backed up version. I don't want to show it if the link works.
* I would love a nice way to put in ISBN and have an API fill it in server-side, might implement a plugin for craft to do that
* It would be nice to provide context to links with by having auto-embedding cards, much like Twitter.
* Consider a new name for Collections as per [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-09/line/1418153064347 conversation on irc]
* I would like to implement [[recursive_reply-contexts|reply contexts]] at some point.
* Checkins. I use Foursquare/Swarm to some degree and have geolocation built in already. This will give me some opportunity to do interesting things with maps.

== Indie Web Camp Tasks ==
(I'm forgetful, but would like to do these!):
* Add some historical examples of blocking users to [[block]]
* Extend the Facebook [[private_posts|Private Posts]] page with information about how private photos are shared.
