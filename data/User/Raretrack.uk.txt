Hi, I'm <span class="h-card">[https://raretrack.uk/ Rob]</span>. I'm a big believer in the concepts behind the indieweb movement, particularly in owning and controlling your own data. I got interested when Kevin Marks talked about it on TWiG (This Week in Google) a while ago now. 

Silos are attractive and entice you as they tend to work out of the box. So I'm here to find alternatives so I don't give in to temptation... :)

Although I'm tech-savvy and can do basic (excuse the pun!) HTML, CSS, VBA and VB.NET, when it comes to indieweb I'm really an end-user and feel very much like a newbie.

== Itches ==
* Ability to upload multiple photos to Flickr from Known
* Ability to bulk upload photos from Flickr to Known

== Future plans ==
* Relink my Known instance to connect with my silo sites (once new version available)
* POSSE more than I do at the moment
* Migrate photos from Facebook and, eventually, Flickr
* Pluck up courage to go an IndieWebCamp one day

== Completed ==
* <s>My own site hosted by Known</s>
* Migrated from Evernote to a combination of Known and Remember the Milk
* Moved photos out of Google Photos
* Moved hosting from Known to [https://reclaimhosting.com Reclaim Hosting]
* Migrated from Google Drive to hosted ownCloud
* Migrated from Feedly to hosted Tiny Tiny RSS
