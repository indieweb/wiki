== About ==

A Network Administrator at [http://www.carsonhealth.org/ Carson Health], Benjamin Terry has taken an interest in the Indie Web.

His site / domain is [https://benjaminterry.net BenjaminTerry.net].

==My Setup==
As someone relatively unskilled in the ways of coding, HTML and CSS, my initial page was static HTML. To add some functionality, I have begun experimenting with Blosxom [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blosxom]. Blosxom is a rather small Perl script that uses simple text files for posting. While I am not certain how well suited Blosxom will be to adding IndieWeb functionality to my site, I have added some mark up on my posts there. My reason for choosing to start with Blosxom is that, with the script being as small and simple as it is, I thought I should be able to read and grasp what it is doing and maybe begin learning to alter it to my needs as necessary. Also, there are a variety of plug-ins for Blosxom that may point me in the right direction for adding desired functions.

==Next Steps==
# Currently, blog entries are added by simply dropping in text files via SFTP. I need to implement a way to create these entries from the site itself.
# Likewise, I need to implement authentication on my site, so there is some amount of security regarding what gets posted there.
# Then the more interesting IndieWeb specific shenanigans can begin...

Should be a fun learning experience!
