Hi there. My name is <span class="h-card">[[http://davidpea.ch David Peach]]</span> and I am a full-time web developer. I have been working recently to move my personal website over from using WordPress into a custom-built solution with Laravel.

Since I moved to Laravel my UI for posting content has become so much more streamlined. As a result I have found myself posting more notes and photos to my site on a daily basis.

I am currently thinking of ways to make it easier and more accessible for everyday people to get set up with their own domain and publish to their own site. WordPress is great but I think there is still a big barrier to entry with regards to some indieweb principles.

I do love the work that the guys at [https://withknown.com/ Known] are doing.
