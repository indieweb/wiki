== About Me ==

I am Ryan Rix. I exist in various places. I have a pile of domains that I am trying to slim down, and am building tools to make my statically-generated website indieweb compatible. 

I have a very [http://doc.rix.si/cce/cce.html <s>goofy</s> interesting computing setup] that leads me down a path of supporting mostly statically generated tooling and libre software that I run and control, but I am also a huge proponent of using [https://matrix.org Matrix.org] as a decentralized data layer to communicate with smarter, personally controlled pieces of software. I am exploring the intersection of ideas like Matrix and the IndieWeb.

Currently my meatbody exists in Oakland, California. [http://whatthefuck.computer/ My homepage] has a real biography that you can read, along with a pile of 'rel=me' to other places I am me at.

== Projects ==

=== Domain Cleanup and 2016 website redesign ===

The goal at the end of this is to have two domains:

==== A portfolio/project hosting site (whatthefuck.computer) ====

This site replaces [http://doc.rix.si doc.rix.si] my current project portfolio/todolist site with basically the same things but nicer looking.

* Rewrite [http://whatthefuck.computer/blog wtf.comp/blog] URLs to [http://notes.whatthefuck.computer notes.wtf.comp] pages
* Rewrite [http://doc.rix.si/ doc.rix.si] pages to [http://whatthefuck.computer wtf.comp] pages.

This page will progressively enhance supporting text-only www browsers like EWW and fancy graphical www browsers like Chrome and Firefox with some sparkly CSS and JavaScripts in a way that doesn't make me frustrated when using it.

==== My miniblog (notes.whatthefuck.computer) ====

* Move all of my blog posts under here and use mfblog or whatever I end up calling it to generate it.
** Support regenerating the index without regenerating every single blog page
** See how stupid an idea it is to implement a micropub listener in elnode to wire up OwnYourGram and OwnYourResponses to it.
*** It might be easier to set up a thing that consumes micropub and exposes them as RSS, as we can then [http://orgmode.org/manual/RSS-Feeds.html automate the org-mode half of it]
* Set up an emacs on shell01 running [http://fort.kickass.systems:10082/cgit/personal/rrix/pub/sico.el.git/ sico] s
** Sico capture templates for easy to use h-entry types
*** text posts
*** u-photos and u-videos that can just get fed an Matrix photo (or a string like "last photo") and push it in to my blog

=== mfblog.el ===

[http://fort.kickass.systems:10082/cgit/personal/rrix/pub/mfblog.git/ mfblog.el] is an uninspiringly named static-site generator for [[Emacs]] [[Org-mode]]. It's pretty much entirely tailored to my usecases, and I am planning to refactor it in to a more generic engine a la [https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page org-page] below.

Basically generate an index of posts, each is a heading in a single Org-mode file, pull metadata and generate pages annotated with [http://microformats.org/ microformats].

==== Functions ====

* Copy static files (favicon, js, css)
* Generate an index
** List of post titles with permalinks to them
** [[h-card]] for [[IndieAuth]] &c
* Generate post pages
** HTML title
** Clean <title> (don't use the HTML)
** Post HTML
** Support all IndieWeb post types possible
*** h-entry
**** support for u-photo, u-video, u-audio based on org-mode attachments
**** support for u-in-reply-to, u-repost-of, u-like-of based on org-mode property table
**** support for p-comment, p-rsvp based on org-mode property table
*** h-review
*** h-event can be inferred if a post has an [http://orgmode.org/manual/Timestamps.html Active Timestamp]
* Generate post RSS Feeds
** Takes a list of Org-mode tags, and generates an RSS feed for posts tagged with each tag (longform.rss, attach.rss, photos.rss, main.rss)
* Syndicate an entry with bridgy
** Automatically republish the entry with the rel=syndication links included.

== Edit the IWC wiki with Emacs ==

You can use [https://github.com/hexmode/mediawiki-el/blob/master/mediawiki.el mediawiki.el] to edit the IWC wiki with a bit of work. Since the site uses [[IndieAuth]], there is no Username/Password combination, you can't just say "Hey mediawiki.el log in for me".

Log in with your favorite graphical www browser and use a web inspector to grab the ''indiewebcamp_session'' cookie, then put this dope as frick elisp in a scratch buffer and evaluate it.

<pre>
(add-to-list 'mediawiki-site-alist '("IndieWebCamp"
                                   "https://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/"
                                   "nil"
                                   "nil"
                                   ""
				   "Main Page")
(setq mediawiki-site "IndieWebCamp")
(url-cookie-store "indiewebcamp_session" "<YOUR COOKIE VALUE>" nil "indiewebcamp.com" "/" t)
</pre>

This will work until the session cookie is invalidated with a browser logout. It's, uh, janky, but it works.
