Hello, I'm Barry, based in Windsor and London in the UK. I'm building an IndieWeb compliant publishing tool in Ruby that I use on my personal website. It's the second version of my software (the first launched in [https://barryfrost.com/2013/09/baker-1 September 2013]) but I've used barryfrost.com as my personal domain since 2002.

I've attended the London Homebrew Website Club and did a [small talk on my website. I'd really like to attend the next IndieWebCamp UK having missed the last couple through work commitments.

== My site ==
I've written up a [https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/colophon more detailed post on my site], but here are the key points:
* Features
** Self-hosting using my personal, primary domain
** Posting of all my notes, articles, bookmarks, photos, replies, reposts and likes directly on my site
** POSSE syndication of my content with Bridgy
** Microformats 2 markup, including h-entry and h-card
** Send and receive replies, reposts, likes and mentions using Webmention
** Reply/repost/like contexts fetched and displayed above posts
** Authentication via IndieAuth and rel="me" links
** Micropub posting as the primary method of creation for all post types
** Webaction buttons to allow actions on Twitter directly from a post
** Storage using text files in Markdown and YAML front-matter metadata
** All pages and assets are served via https
** RSS feeds of new posts and webmentions
** Auto-embedding of images and YouTube videos linked in posts
** View posts by tags
** Monthly archive index pages
** Navigate index pages using pagination
* Using
** Ruby 2.2 with Sinatra 
** Unicorn on nginx
** MongoDB for indexing/querying posts
** Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Linux 
** Hosted on a 1Gb Digital Ocean Droplet (VPS)

== Aims/itches ==
* Allow for multiple in-reply-to's
* Proxy non-SSL images and "back up" Twitter profile icons
* Expand full URLs from tweet reply-contexts t.co links
* Tool/bookmarklet for one-click Micropub reposts
* Check-in post type; import my Foursquare data
* Localise timestamps with Javascript
* Enable liking for Last.fm songs, POSSE'd to my account
* Vouch
* Collection posts

==I can help with==
* Ruby (to an intermediate level)
* nginx setup and SSL 
* Heroku and Digital Ocean hosting advice/tips
