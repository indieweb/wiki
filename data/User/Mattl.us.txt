I'm Matt Lee, one of the folks behind behind Foo Communications, a company/experiment in music and social media, including Libre.fm, a new social media platform that offers musicians exclusive promotion and play in exchange for licensing their music under a free culture license, and GNU social, a federated social networking project.

You might know me from my very long stint working with the FSF. I am somewhat still there, albeit as a volunteer working on GNU things.

I still live in Boston for the time being, but I am considering a move to the West Coast.

I'm at Creative Commons doing various tech stuff with free software. 

I am irretrievably 'mattl' in most places.
