My primary site ([http://boffosocko.com www.boffosocko.com]) is powered by [[WordPress]] while I also maintain a secondary self-hosted "social stream" powered by [[Known]]. 
<br/><br/>

== Itches ==

* Check out [[IndieMark]] for additional ideas of things to add to my site
* Set up an IndieWebCamp outpost with meetings in Los Angeles
* Spread concept of IndieWeb into Academe as a means of communication and syndication of ideas (whether by samizdat or not)
* Assist [[User:david.shanske.com|David Shanske]] on integrating IndieWeb principles into [[WordPress]]; as a minimum try to dogfood it and provide worthwhile field testing and feedback on his modules.
* Update self-hosted [[Known]] site and play around with internals
* Find a better way in WordPress to sort/differentiate between likes, comments, pingbacks, potentially using a facepile set up.
* Find issue in code on [http://independentpublisher.me/ Independent Publisher] (WordPress) theme that prevents some of the IndieWeb comments from displaying -- particularly likes and comments from Facebook/Twitter. see also [https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher/issues/201]
* Play around with IndieWeb feed readers [[Woodwind]] and [[Monocle]]
* Brows [[to-do]] list and see what I can help there

== Working On ==

* Fix custom code so that auto-posting from [[ownyourgram]] doesn't automatically syndicate out to Facebook, Twitter, et al. via Jetpack in WordPress
* Fix [http://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/ h-entry] on posts--some data is missing; in particular figure out a way to add tag: img class="u-photo" src="…" / to the photo on individual posts to get photo into h-entry. Also wrap category and tag portions with tag: a class="p-category" href="…"  … /a  to get categories in as well.

== Finished ==

* Add a more extensive [[h-card]] on my site
* Updated to more modern responsive theme that is as IndieWeb compatible as possible
* Set up a self-hosted [[Known]] site 
* Introduced IndieWeb concepts at DrupalCampLA at UC Irvine in 2015
* Set up [[Micropub]] endpoint and [[ownyourgram]] to publish photos to my own site.

=== Audio / Podcasting ===

I want to be able to upload [[audio]] files to my site and be able to use it as a [[podcast]] feed.
