== WordPress for Indieweb == 

One of the smallest yet largest issues is how to integrate Indieweb concepts into WordPress. WordPress has its own way of doing things, and one of the hardest things is to plan things out so they neatly integrate into the system. While WordPress is designed to be extensible, replacing large amounts of core functionality creates implementation issues in the long term.

The challenge, which I and others continue to refine, is to come up with ways to add Indieweb functionality in the least invasive way possible, so that a current user of WordPress could easily add support to their site.

== Working On ==

Each step below is necessary before moving on to the next step.

* figure out (fix) [[location]] support
* add [[venue]] support
* add [[checkin]] post support
* add [[event]] support
* add [[flight]] support
* ...

== Itches ==

* Continuing to refine the plugins created for WordPress and add more functionality for myself and others.
* Idea for rewriting Simple Location to include a venue taxonomy now that WordPress has taxonomy meta. This use case would be perfect for it.
* Owning my bookmarks - The primary reason I don't own my bookmarks is the lack of a seamless path to posting from my Android phone, which is where I do a great deal of reading.
* Better Support for media posts...read, watch, listen, jam...needs improvement in display
* Recent adding of time properties would allow me to start event posting if I improve location support
* My fork of the _s starter theme that is mf2/indieweb ready needs refreshing.
