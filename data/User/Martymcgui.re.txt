== Working on ==
* making backend choices to support posting and POSSE for posts / images / notes. probably Flask?

== Itches ==
* POSSE to Twitter
* PESOS from blogs / podcasts I contribute to
* <s>an [https://unhosted.org/ unhosted] evernote knockoff using [https://remotestorage.io/ remotestorage.io] as my backend</s>
** I'm happy enough with [https://laverna.cc laverna] at the moment, though I haven't yet migrated any old notes in and support for files/images is limited/broken.
* <s>an internet archive style backup that snarfs pages that i want to bookmark into my notes</s>
** I'm happy enough with [https://pinboard.in pinboard] at the moment. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
* my own goodreads to track my read/to-read (plus movies, podcasts, etc.)
