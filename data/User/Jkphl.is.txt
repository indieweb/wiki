== My personal itch ==
<div class="p-note">
I don't consider the content management system I use for my site ([http://typo3.org TYPO3]) appropriate anymore. I'm convinced I would publish a lot more (and on a more regular basis) if I had a custom solution covering my very personal use cases. I need to work on this!
