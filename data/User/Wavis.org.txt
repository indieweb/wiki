Travis Wellman ([http://wavis.org/ wavis.org]) is mostly interested in distributed application platforms. IE, being able to distribute an app (or binary, or source code) and run it with all the advantages of centralization ... without centralization.

[http://baseparadigm.org/ BaseParadigm] is his work on this so far. It is a binary graph data management library for Java. It is not, and will never be, block chain based.
