A Portland-area geek, photographer, writer, and urban poultry enthusiast. Currently deploying [http://withknown.com/ Known] on [http://brient.net/ brient.net] for a collection of personal short notes, photographs, and writing. 


Previously, I had maintained a personal blog on that site during my mid-to-late teenage years. It's as embarrassing as it sounds, but gave me a lot of experience in web design, server administration, and various scripting languages.


Over the last decade, I've been working in a fast-paced start-up that hadn't left much time for personal website development. With SILOs taking over, it felt pointless, anyway.


During the fall of 2013, [[User:Caseorganic.com|Amber Case]] gave a talk in [http://boghossian.com/ Peter Boghossian]'s computer ethics class at Portland State University that introduced me to the Indie Web. I was immediately onboard.


I'm looking forward to continuing to learn more about development in the context of the Indie Web. It's an exciting and highly ambitious effort that I follow with great interest.
