I’m a computer engineer who is learning how to live in the analog world and relearning almost every day the power of networks.
I have a lot of opinions which are about stuff i have no right to speak of but i am generally a good person who always follows the golden rule.
Oh, and i mostly build web “toys” because calling them apps is too grandiose. I finish the mvp but rarely wrap it in a nice paper.
