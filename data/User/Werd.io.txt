== Projects ==

CEO and co-founder of [http://withknown.com Known], a startup whose platform is designed to adhere to indieweb principles. See: [[Known]], formerly [[idno]].

His site / domain is [http://werd.io werd.io].

== Itches ==

=== Audio / Podcasting ===

I want to be able to upload [[audio]] files to my site and be able to use it as a [[podcast]] feed. (I really want to start a podcast.)

=== Notifications of profile references ===

When someone [[homepage#Webmention_to_homepage|webmentions my domain]] I want to be told so I can [[reply]] if necessary.

=== Live discussion ===

I want each post to be like its own chatroom, with some contributions coming in from silos, some from the indieweb, and some from in-site comments - in real time.

=== Privacy ===

[[privacy]]. Sometimes I just want to send a nudge to a few people - for example, in my company. This would also let me share anecdotal health information with my family.

=== Revamped events ===

[[Event]] posts support was built after IndieWebCamp [[2013]] and are pretty bare-bones. I'd love for non-indieweb people to be able to [[RSVP]] without having to use Facebook.

=== Video ===

I want to be able to record [[video]], and again, be able to show off editable video in a podcast.
