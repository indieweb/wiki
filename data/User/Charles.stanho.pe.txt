Charles Stanhope is a hardware/software engineer with an interest in open, decentralized platforms. He thinks the internet and the web are amazing inventions that humanity has barely begun to figure out how to best use. He believes that for the internet and web to continue to be a tool for good will require that individuals and groups can be sovereign participants. He is trying to do his part to make that happen. Charles thinks writing about himself in the third person is ''awkward''.
