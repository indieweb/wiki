My name is Xavier Badosa and I am the promoter of [http://json-stat.org JSON-stat.org]. JSON-stat is a simple lightweight JSON dissemination format best suited for data visualization, mobile apps or open data initiatives. I am also the author of the [http://json-stat.com JSON-stat Javascript Toolkit], a library to deal with JSON-stat responses.

My current personal web project is [http://dotepub.com dotepub.com]: an automatic conversion service from web page to e-book (in the EPUB standard and in the Amazon MOBI format). Even though [http://www.slideshare.net/badosa/ebooks-are-not-the-future-of-books/ I don’t think e-books are the future of books], I’ve developed this tool for these transitional times full of dedicated devices with limited web browsing capabilities.
