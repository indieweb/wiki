== Dan Connolly ==

I have been an open web advocate since reading [https://www.w3.org/blog/2016/08/25-years-ago-the-world-changed-forever/ the original alt.hypertext post] 25 years ago. From 1995-2010, I was a [https://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ W3C technical staff member] working on HTML and Web Architecture. Since then, my day job is [http://www.kumc.edu/ea-mi/medical-informatics.html writing software to support research at KU Med Center].

I'm usually DanC on freenode. I was going to update [[IRC_People]] to that effect (especially for the cool nick linking in the IRC logs) but then I wondered about migrating to dckc to consolidate my "brand". 

=== My publishing set-up and goals ===

[http://www.madmode.com/ My madmode tinkering lab notebook] is based on a flask-based static blog generator by Nicolas Perriault. I don't blog there as much as I'd like. Items with my [http://www.madmode.com/search/label/publishing/ publishing tag] are the most relevant to IndieWeb.

I aspire to [https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/enabling-webmentions-in-jekyll/ Aaron Gustafson's 3-tier architecture]:

# Static webmentions collected when the site was generated form the baseline experience;
# JavaScript-enabled browsers get any webmentions that were published since I last generated the site; and
# JavaScript-enabled browsers with WebSockets support get real-time updates with any webmentions that are published after the page loads.

IOU a search box.
