Hi, I'm Richard Eriksson and I'm just a gwai lo. I write on my blog, appropriately named [http://justagwailo.com/ Just a Gwai Lo].

I like the idea of POSSE, but prefer PEACE (Posting Elsewhere, Aggregating Comprehensively and Eternally). If what I post elsewhere an RSS feed, I pull it into [http://richard.eriksson.ca/blogosphere my blogosphere]. That doesn't really satisfy the "Eternally" part as a) some of the content isn't on my domain and b) Drupal's aggregator expires older content. (I'm open to suggestions as what the second E should be instead of Eternally.)

=== Silos ===

If I can point a domain to something on a silo, it's not really so bad. 

* Tumblr: [http://sillygwailo.com/ sillygwailo.com] which pulls in faves and whatnot through IFTTT. Also the occasional book quote and notes about how I'm watching baseball in any given year.

=== Working On ===

* Microblogging on your own domain with Drupal using [http://archive.justagwailo.com/warble Warble] (working proof of concept on my archived site)
** TODO: Import all broadcast (non-reply) [https://twitter.com/sillygwailo tweets]
** TODO: Import everything from [https://thoughtstreams.io/sillygwailo my ThoughtStreams]
