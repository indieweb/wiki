'''Updated''': my domain has now changed to http://davidpea.ch

I am currently sorting out redirects for old links to 301 to new equivalents.

I decided to build my new website using Laravel and so far have loved every minute. I will be adding some code examples to site soon to share how I approached certain indieweb aspects.


Hi there. 

Firstly a big thank you to all of those who have helped me this far on my IndieWeb journey.

'''My IndieWeb Setup'''

I am using WordPress as my CMS of choice with the IndieWeb Plugin. The IndieWeb plugin gives you a list of good plugins for use in getting in to the IndieWeb. I have installed all except for the Hum Url shortener.

On top of those plugins, I have developed a couple of my own - the repositories for which I will link to early January 2015.

'''Currently in Development'''

A checkin plugin for WordPress that grabs your geolocation and makes a note - with the lat and lng saved in separate custom fields.

Plans then to use this to display location information on note posts where applicable.

Looking to integrate with foursquare as well.


'''Based in'''
Tamworth, UK.
