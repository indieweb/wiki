'''Stub:''' I write code on a nearly constant basis, from web stuff to random musical experiments to distributed storage tools. I'm slowly tidying up a lot of old projects and pushing them to the public web. While I don't have huge time available as a general case right now (busy professional life) I'm always happy to come along and help build things which make the web a better place for ''people''.
