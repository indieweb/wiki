I only started on my Indieweb journey in 2015 because I'd not heard about it before then; however, I have been blogging since 2002 and have always valued my independent part of the internet so the principles behind the Indieweb resonant with me.

I'm a [[Jekyll]] user. My first steps were adding [[microformats2]] markup to meet as much of the [[IndieMark]] level 1 and 2 requirements as I could. After that I added support for [[POSSE]]ing link posts to Pinboard, photos to Flickr and notes/tweets to Twitter (as far as I can tell the only thing I have left to do from the Level 2 requirements is Aggregation). Moving onto Level 3 requirements I've added automatically sending webmentions and receiving them thanks to [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com]; although long-term I do not want to depend on Javascript for displaying them.
