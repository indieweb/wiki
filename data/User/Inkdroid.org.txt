Hi I'm [http://inkdroid.org Ed Summers]. I'm a software developer working at the [http://mith.umd.edu Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities].

I'm interested in the Web as an archive. I've worked putting traditional archival materials on the Web, but I'm actually more interested in what makes the Web more like an archive -- the so called Long Web. This includes such things as permalinks, persistence, visible data, robots.txt/crawling, etc ... but also newer approaches to distributed storage (IPFS, NameCoin, etc).

I'm also in the DC area an am interested in getting a Homebrew group or IndieWebCamp going. Please get in touch with me on [https://twitter.com/edsu Twitter], via email at [mailto:ehs@pobox.com ehs@pobox.com] on in #indiewebcamp (I'm edsu).
