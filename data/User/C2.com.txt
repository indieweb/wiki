[[Ward Cunningham]] has been pushing content to the independent web for twenty years from c2.com.

The site hosted the first ever wiki, http://c2.com/cgi/wiki

I ask, what obligation do I have to the authors of the 36,000 articles there to keep the site up and keep the site editable? I could donate the content to, say, archive.net. That would be like taking a living thing then killing and stuffing it in the name of preservation. I can do better, I think.

My preservation solution is to federate the content. It is only through proliferation that things really last. Much of our genome, for example, is more stable than the earth's continents. That's something. The internet is speedy but life is tenacious.
