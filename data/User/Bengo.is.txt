# Progress
3/16/2015
* I bought some domains, including bengo.is. You'll see others show up over time.
* I spun up a Google Compute Engine server (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) with a certain IP. I then created a DNS A record of bengo.is to that IP (.is nameserver swapping is difficult through iwantmyname.com)
* I `apt-get install nginx` and `service nginx start`, then edited the default HTML to be sufficient enough for IndieAuth.
* I can now edit wiki pages!

# TODO:
* Have an official avatar URL on a domain I control. Not just https://cldup.com/wk0lcdq6cj.jpg
* Post a note
* Support HTTPS at bengo.is . Who should sign that cert if I want you to trust me the most? :)
* Be able to post a note in reply to people when I disagree with them :P

# Ideas
* wrt [[URL Design], I think I plan for all of my canonical URLs to be of the form https://bengo.pub/id/{uuid}
** Other aesthetically-pleasing links can point to that. This has some similar properties to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree .
** Could also support https://bengo.pub/data/{semantic-hash-of-arbitrary-length} for Content-Addressable Storage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage
*** Relevant Research: SimHash and other Locality-Sensitive Hash Functions: http://blog.livefyre.com/architecting-sidenotes/
