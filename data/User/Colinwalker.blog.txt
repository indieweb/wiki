Rebooted the blog in March 2016 with the intent of owning everything I do on the web.

Long form, microblog and microcast are all hosted locally with long form syndicated to Medium and microcast to iTunes. The microblog posts will be syndicated to [http://micro.blog micro.blog] when it launches as I no longer use Twitter.

Embracing the Indieweb via WordPress plugins for IndieAuth, WebMentions and Micropub but manually added markup for h-card and h-entry.
