== Itches ==
=== better tweet archive presentation ===
* kevinmarks.com/tweets is currently the direct export from twitter
* it is js;dr, and doesn't show timestamps or have mf2 markup
* I forget to update it (as it is in monthly chunks)
=== Fragmentions as distributed highlight posts ===
Creating by hand:
* select text in browser
* create fragmention (FF: paste text after a # in the URL bar; Chrome: use plugin)
* post to your site
* send webmention to http://mention-tech.appspot.com/

Viewing:
* look up URL in mention-tech.appspot.com (and maybe webmention.io and webmention.herokuapp.com too)
* display as highlight in the web page
