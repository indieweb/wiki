[https://github.com/myfreeweb/sweetroll Sweetroll] is the engine that powers my website, [https://unrelenting.technology unrelenting.technology]. It's written in [[Haskell]]. I also wrote the following libraries to use in Sweetroll:
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/http-link-header a parser for the HTTP Link header]
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/microformats2-parser a parser for Microformats 2]
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/gitson gitson], a Git+JSON storage library
* [https://github.com/myfreeweb/indieweb-algorithms indieweb-algorithms], implementations of algorithms like [[authorship]]

[https://github.com/myfreeweb/indieweb-components indieweb-components] is a collection of lightweight Web Components for [[webactions]] / [[indie-config]], [[fragmentions]] (used in Sweetroll).

[https://myfreeweb.github.io/foxshare/ FoxShare] is a tiny web page for adding anything (e.g. [[Micropub]] clients such as [[Quill]] and [https://micropublish.herokuapp.com Micropublish]) to [[Firefox Share]].
