		<li> automate sending webmentions in some sane way. (Django post_save signal failed.)</li>

		<li> parse received webmentions using an asyc queue.</li>

		<li> move to a file-based storage (consider html+mf2) and use MySQL for meta-cache only. See <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/databases-antipattern" title="databases-antipattern" class="mw-redirect">databases-antipattern</a> <del datetime="2015-01-07">(responses to articles moved to YAML files.)</del> <ins datetime="2015-01-07">Started <a href="https://github.com/kartikprabhu/pullback_note">Pullback_Note</a> to move notes from DB.</ins></li>

		<li> <del datetime="2014-04-23">receive mentions on Notes. (Hint: use url to identify posts instead of DB objects.)</del> (Done: as of 2014-04-23)</li>

		<li> better homepage idea: use homepage for updates, including status (like currently reading), latest notes and articles and also entry points to explore other things on the site. Reserve about page for info about self and site. Why?: homepage is where readers would land first, and presumably they are more interested in "what's new?"</li>

		<li> better reply-context and embedding.</li>

		<li> auto-linking (such as @username) in notes and responses</li>

		<li> chaining conversations.</li>

		<li> notifications for new activity such as new responses to posts</li>

		<li> cache or lazy load avatars for improved performance</li>

		<li> self-host photos/art. move from Google and deviantArt. import old tweets and G+ posts to own site.</li>

		<li> move draft posts from old blogger site. put up move notice on posts with new URL.</li>

		<li>cleanup sub projects and put on Github for others to possibly use.</li>

		<li><del datetime="2014-08-02">paginate notes feed with some sane date grouping. Possibly by year-month</del> <ins datetime="2014-08-02">Done on 2014-08-02</ins></li>

		<li>separate colophon page listing the plumbing innards of the site.</li>

		<li>accept webmentions linking to alternate URLs of posts e.g. https or http</li>

		<li>publish page listing replies to some URL. Useful to see all marginalia to some particular post/ebook.</li>

		<li>import ebook notes from Google Play to site as marginalia</li>
