I'm best known for [[Bridgy]], a hosted service that provides [[backfeed]],
[[POSSE]], and [[webmention]]s for blog providers.

I also created and maintain
[https://granary-demo.appspot.com/ granary],
a library and REST API that converts between silo APIs and
[[ActivityStreams]], [[microformats2]], [[Atom]], and other formats
([https://snarfed.org/2012-03-12_activitystreams_for_facebook_and_twitter details],
[https://github.com/search?q=%40snarfed+unofficial related projects]). It's used in
[[Woodwind]], [[Shrewdness]],
[https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/ facebook-atom],
[https://twitter-atom.appspot.com/ twitter-atom], and
[https://instagram-atom.appspot.com/ instagram-atom], among others.

My web site is [https://snarfed.org/ snarfed.org]. It's [[WordPress]] with
IndieWeb plugins and minor tweaks. I [[POSSE]] posts manually, I use
[https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourresponses ownyourresponses] to automatically
[[PESOS]] [[likes]], [[comments]], [[repost|retweets]], and [[RSVPs]], and I use
[[Bridgy]] to backfeed silo responses.
