== To Do ==
* Simple py IndieAuth
* IndieAuth-only file access


== Indie Web Projects ==
* [https://github.com/pauloppenheim/webmention-basic webmention-basic] - Trivial IndieWeb webmentions receiver in python, wsgi or cgi.


== Indie Web Config ==
* https://pauloppenheim.com - public landing
** [[StatusNet]] - https://pauloppenheim.com/status/ - which then cross-posts to:
*** [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/pauloppenheim - because [[POSSE]]
** [[Portfolio]] - two setups
*** new dynamic python system https://pauloppenheim.com/projects/ - no name yet, not open source, not really ready for others
*** old static site https://pauloppenheim.com/portfolio/
*** '''Really''' want to get this done, but it's not a priority to me right now
* http://example.com - "confidential" server; for sharing with others non-publicly
** private file shares
** proxy server
** misc ad-hoc servers
** frequently broken (as it is right now!)
* http://example.net - "private" server; only for me
** Backup
** Synchronization
** Sourcing
** Basically "My Computer", but not really built to be worked directly on, primarily to be cloned out and back; sync point


== Technologies ==
* Languages: Python, Bash
* Serving: WSGI, CGI (because ...)
* Hosting: Shared (big-name socially-responsible hosting co., moderately old tools), VM (popular VM provider)


== Interests ==
* Privacy
* Security
* Synchronization / Replication
* Partitioned data hierarchies (currently: private > confidential > public)
* Quantified Self (somewhat ironic, given the above) / Habit Design
* Games / Realtime simulated networked spaces ("Virtual Worlds" ugh)
