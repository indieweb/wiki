I am Martijn. Once upon a time I followed an online lesson in HTML on my grandfather’s computer. Then I built websites on MSN Groups (R.I.P.) and [[GeoCities]] (R.I.P.). These days I work mostly with front-end technologies in my spare time, but try to keep my [[PHP]] knowledge up-to-date as well.

Very interested in tools for [http://www.multilingualweb.eu/about-the-project a multilingual web]. I speak Dutch (<code>nl-NL</code>), English(<code>en-GB</code>), and Swedish (<code>sv-SE</code>) fluently. I have a good understanding of German (<code>de-DE</code>) as well.

== My [[FAQ#What_is_a_personal_website|personal website]]. ==

It is <a href="http://vanderven.se/martijn/"><code>vanderven.se/martijn/</code></a>.
* '''All lowercase.''' This is important because directory names are case-sensitive on the server.
* '''With a trailing <code>/</code>.''' Less important, but [[canonical]]. It is a directory.
* '''Serving [[HTTP]].''' Plans to move to [[HTTPS]] are being discussed.
