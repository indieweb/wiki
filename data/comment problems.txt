'''<dfn>comment problems</dfn>''' commonly include spam, abuse, and other noise that can motivate switching to [[silo]] comment embeds, or turning off comments entirely.

== Issues ==
Common complaints include:

* Spam control 
* Moderation becomes overwhelming[https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/646708303217602560]
* Inability to surface useful comments amidst noise [https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/646708303217602560]
* Moving the conversation to a silo is 'easier' [citation needed]
* Comments change how the [[post]] is interpreted by the reader [http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments]

=== POSSE and backfeed ===
If you [[POSSE]] to a silo and then [[backfeed]] comments on that POSSE copy, you may experience the same issues that the silo experiences in general, e.g.
* {{kevinmarks}} 2015-09-11..13 saw abusive tweets show-up on his site that were made in-reply-to the POSSE tweet copies of his indieweb posts about the 2015 [[XOXO]] conference and festival

== Solutions ==
* Use [[webmention]]. For now, [[spam]] and the other mentioned problems has not been a problem with purely indieweb webmentions, likely because webmention is not widespread enough to be a target.

Note: if you POSSE and backfeed, especially using a backfeed to webmention service like [[Bridgy]], you may receive spam and other abuse via webmentions from Bridgy from silo posts.
