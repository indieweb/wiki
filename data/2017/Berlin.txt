'''<dfn class="p-name summary">IndieWebCamp Berlin 2017</dfn>''' is the third [[IndieWebCamp]] in Berlin and one of several IndieWebCamp events in 2017!

<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is gaining awareness. To grow it and help people get started, we're meeting for Barcamp-like collaboration in Berlin for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, teaching, helping.

Join us during [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2017 beyond tellerrand in Berlin] and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe most importantly – encourage everybody to own their own content and identities.
