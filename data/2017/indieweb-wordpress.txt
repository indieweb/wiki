=== Fresh Installs ===

[[Getting Started on WordPress]]
 
# Get WordPress installed
# Install IndieWeb plugin
# Go to "Your Profile" under Users.
#* Not currenty properly documented, but you should go here to set up your identities elsewhere, which will be converted to rel=me links.
#* This is critical for relme auth to work!
#* Its also not well documented that you should have the link back to your website from all of the silos where you are declaring rel=me.
#* It would be even better to include this in the "onboarding wizard" to do the interrogation and verification as you're entering your rel=me.
# Under Appearance / Wigets, you can add the "rel=me" widget in your sidebar. Otherwise, it'll be added to your page in a hidden fashion.
# Go to IndieWeb -> Extensions. These are plugins that enable additional functionality.
#* Start with Webmention. Install and then activate. Then, go to Settings -> Discussion and configure your Webmention settings.
#* Then, return to the IndieWeb -> Extensions page and enable Semantic Linkbacks, which makes Webmentions look pretty. No settings. Yay!
#* Then, install and activate Micropub. No settings for this either.
#* Next up is Post Kinds, which enables you to create different "kinds" of posts. After you've installed and activated, there are many settings for this plugin under the IndieWeb menu to configure different Post Kinds. Sane defaults exist.
#* Now, you can install and activate Syndication Links, which has some settings in the IndieWeb menu. This is for when you syndicate posts to other places, the permalinks to those things get addede to the original post.
#* Last is Bridgy Publish, which makes it a bit easier for Bridgy to do Publish. We all agreed that this should be changed to be a plugin for registering with Bridgy.
#* If you want Brid.gy, go visit the website and connect. Feedback from the room: Brid.gy is a little confusing on the front page. What is it? How do I sign up?
# Now, its theme time!
#* Best choices are Independent Publisher and SemPress.
