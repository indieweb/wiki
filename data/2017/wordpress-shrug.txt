* What's the best path forward to help accelrate adoption of IndieWeb in WordPress?
** Advocacy at WordCamps.
** Work with the Jetpack team to advocate for integration in Jetpack
* How much should we care about IndieWeb-ifying WordPress.com? And other similar locked down, managed WordPress hosts?
** Definitely a lot, but it should be built in, not bolted on externally like Bridgy's WordPress.com support, etc.
* Is there a way to structure my WordPress site to choose specific types of content on the "front page" and content segregated elsewhere?
** Yes! GWG gave a good answer, as did Snarfed.
** You can hide categories, tags, or post-kinds from the front page.
** Setup wizard/ onboarding - in indieweb plugin (Creating ActionItem below)
*** What are the right questions to ask? What are the proper answers?
**** Simplest universal approach: 1) what things do you want to create? 2) What things do you want to show on your home page?
**** Alternative: Offer a few clear opens (Show everything in a stream vs Show everything in it's category (Known style)
**** Mascot? Cat - teach/walk you through indieweb
***** IndieWeb Wapuu  ( https://github.com/pfefferle/indie-wapuu ) <- THIS!
* Is there a fix for issues with front page webmentions?
** Yes, there is a setting now in the Webmentions plugin (under Settings -> Discussion) that provides for this.
* DreamHost creating 1 click instatablle wordpress that integrates fully with micro.blog

== Action Items ==
* GWG to create an issue for leveraging the Indieweb plugin as an onboarding engine for Gen 2 users.
* cleverdevil, Scott Jenson, and MichelleJL will spend some time tag teaming the UI/UX.
* Anomalily will write explainer blog post and/or docs.
