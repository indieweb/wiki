== Notes ==
* Jan: How can I share private content with friends in an IndieWeb way?
* Aaron: Create an ACL for every URL with users who are authorized and let them sign in with IndieAuth
* for friends who don't have IndieAuth: use e.g. Twitter URLs in ACL; allow sign in with Twitter/Facebook, too
* Sebastiaan: has this live on seblog.nl, shown demo
* sign-in form has IndieAuth + Twitter
* 401 if not signed in
* 403 if no permissions
* ACLs could be URLs for pages with lists of URLs /h-cards (http://indieweb.org/IRC_People)
* access to those lists can be authenticated in the same way ...
* a "request access" feature on the 403 page that sends a notification of who requested access (after the user logs in)
* for less tech-savvy friends support sign-in with email using magic links
* RSS feeds are a bit more complicated
* can be requested with delegated access_tokens
* Aaron: there's probably a spec for it
* get permalink authentication working first, then on homepage; later feeds
* "secret URLs" can be a simple option but they could easily be leaked
* very low technical barrier, works from static sites, too
* Private Webmentions: protocol for sending webmentions from private URLs (http://indieweb.org/private-webmention)
* Jan: Private webmentions from homepage to homepage as "friend requests"?!
* Lukas: define microformat for 'friend request'?
* Aaron: reply to friend request with another webmention

Ordered by implementation complexity

* One-time use URLs
* Capability (unguessable) URLs
* Private Webmention
* Access control on permalinks requiring login (indieauth, twitter, github, email, etc)
* Access control based on groups (lists of h-cards)
* Add private posts to your home page or other feeds based on who is logged in (browser cookies)
* Feed readers fetching feeds on behalf of users (auth flow TBD)
* Friend requests

Multi-language posts
* presenting a different set of posts on the home page based on the language of the viewer
