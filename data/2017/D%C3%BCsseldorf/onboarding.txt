Session: Onboarding & Personas

== Notes ==
* IndieAuth barrier to entry to IndieWebCamp
* Jeremy: historically intentional because of people who wouldn't want to do but just talk; but kept out curious people too, now has more negative than positive effects
* First objective: Onboarding to the community
* Personas (started in IWC Berlin 2016: https://indieweb.org/2016/Berlin/onboarding) could help develop a proposition
* was a full-day exercise
* hard to decide on these
* ran out of time to finish up
* Unclear what IndieWebCamp is about and who's it for; wiki is confusing
* But setting up website for wiki sign in was fairly easy in comparison
* Question: are there any other digital touchpoints beyond the Wiki?
* mostly personal webpages
* Jeremy: Homepage should be more propositional
* Site revamp 7/2016 (indiewebcamp.com -> indieweb.org) was about making it more accessible
* Word of mouth seems to be a very effective way to onboard new people
* "Is this something for me if I'm not a developer?" (-> is this a hackathon?)
* Common misconception, maybe a flaw in the communications (it's the other skills that are actually well in demand)
* Jeremy: The original reason for putting the barrier into place is long gone
* It would be important to get people on board who do not fulfil the current "requirements"
* Having your own website is great, it's the purpose of the movement, but must not be precondition
* Suggestions for improvement:
* make a more organized landing page
* links go to events but event pages assume people have seen the homepage
* people who this is for are not mentioned
* problem with the 2016 renewal: it was technically driven?
* make a brand new site indieweb.org and integrate the wiki with that later? (not realistic, change is rather going to be incremental)
* examplary journeys to illustrate how people come from different entry points
* "if you have a project it's fine, if not, you are just as welcome"
* Joschi demoing the IndieWebWeek site
* competitor analysis: what do other, similar movements do? what is their proposition?
* indiewebcamp is a rather opinionated community, not just an event
* codebar
* current landing page does not show clearly enough that the common effort is not some code (as in a open source project) but to do something with it (everybody on their own site)
* talks, articles could be condensed down to snack-size pieces for this purpose
* feedback: would have been great to see the intro talk from this morning on the website beforehand
* a video of that should probably be on the front page?
* analytics/analysis: how do people get to the site, what do they do
* server logs probably sufficient (referrers...)
* a session like this on every event, to collect ppls experiences; basic qualitative data
* user journey mapping
* a first update can be as easy as adding one paragraph at the top of the landing page meeting above requirements
