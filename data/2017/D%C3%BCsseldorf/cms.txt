Coolness-Level-Metric for Indieweb-friendly CMS
* How tech-savvy are you?
* How much functionality should be out of the box? (complying to IndieMark?)

CMSs mentioned:
* WordPress (aka WordMess) + https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/
* AerosolCMS https://aerosolcms.com
* No support for IndieWeb tech yet, but Open Source.
* Tech: Serverless Lambda/API Gateway on AWS, Node.js
* PHP
* Architecture isn't a good fit for indieweb features. e.g. embedding microformats in themes. You'd have to go through all html files
* Loads of plugins around and they're working decently if your theme is indiewebfriendly. They do evolve very quickly these days and updates break stuff
* Webmention client plugin https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-php
* Jekyll
* Static Site Generator
* Ruby
* https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github

=== Guide to CMS ===
There's no way around 'tinkering' currently.

Question 1: How much tinkering are you willing to do / how much control do you want (need).

Minimal tinkering: Hosted CMS with limited but proven functionality 
* Known and ...?

More control (and tinkering)
* Question 2 :)

Question 2: To CMS or not to CMS:  Consider not using a CMS at all. How about a stastic site generator?

Static Site Generators

CMS
* Question 3 :)

Question 3: Find the best fit CMS - What needs do you have?

Publishing and reach. Only I log into my website. My content is syndicated to many places.
Personal social networking: Others want to log in. My content doesn't leave my premises.
