== Jeremy Keith ==
{{adactio}} set up [[OwnYourSwarm]]. He improved the [[service worker]] on his site, which now not just shows a "sorry, you are offline" notice, but also a list of other articles that are available offline.

== Vladimir Andrijevikj ==
[https://andrijevik.net/ Vladimir] tuned HTTPS on his page to get Qualis SSL Lab A+ and securityheaders.io A scores, and automated everything with [[Ansible]].


== Oliver Gutperl ==
[https://oliver.gutperl.de Oliver] set up an IndieAuth [[authorization-endpoint]] that runs on [[AWS Lambda]] and authorizes users against AWS IAM credentials. Source is [https://github.com/digital-sailors/iam-indieauth here].


== Sebastiaan Andeweg ==
{{sebsel}} set up an authorization endpoint on [http://seblog.nl his site]. People can also log into his site using IndieAuth.

== Steffen Rademacker  ==
[https://webgefrickel.de Steffen Rademacker] set up HTTPS and POSSE to Twitter from Micropub (via [[brid.gy]]). ([https://webgefrickel.de/notes/20170514163325 demo post] [http://twtr.io/1RhcjeF6XB0 syndicated post])

== Jan Sauer and Sven Röttering ==
[http://jansauer.de Jan] and Sven build a posting interface. They show how it automatically switches from a short note to a post with title and content when the content becomes larger.

== Andreas Nebiker and Tom Arnold ==
[https://andreasnebiker.com/ Andreas] and [https://webrocker.de/ Tom] updated the [[CMS]] page, made it less tech-y and added a data from yesterdays [[2017/Düsseldorf/cms|CMS session]]. They ask the community to help improve it.

== Andreas Nebiker ==
Andreas also “shaved some yaks” and set up a toolchain for developing and deploying [service workers], and quickly finished a simple demo example on a clients page in the last 5 minutes.

== Lukas Rosenstock ==
[https://lukasrosenstock.net/ Lukas] also looked into [[IndieAuth]] and build [https://cloudobjects.io/indieauth.cloudobjects.io/TestAPI a tool] to help validate your configuration: given a homepage URL, it shows the found endpoint and h-card, and gives information how those were found.

== Joschi Kuphal ==
[https://jkphl.is Joschi] worked on his [http://micrometa.jkphl.is/v2/ micrometa parser], which extracts various embedded data formats from pages: Microformats, Microdata, RDFa Lite, rel-attributes and (in the future) JSON-LD


== Sebastian Lasse ==
{{sl007}} worked on his indieauth.com like service, specifically a set of Web Components that display cards for various microformats: h-cards, h-review, …

== Lukas Bestle ==
[http://lukasbestle.com/ Lukas] (from the [[Kirby]] team) documented how to set up a kirby page for [[RelMeAuth]]: https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/relmeauth

== Calum Ryan ==
[https://calumryan.com/ Calum] was trying to get Bridgy to send the replies on tweets (not finished) and improved the [[service worker]]/[[Progressive Web App]] setup on his page using [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/ Google Lighthouse] (where it now scores 100%!)

== Dirk Döring ==
[http://DirkDoering.de Dirk] decided he needed a more flexible page to really start and thus set up [[Kirby]]

== Matthias Ott ==
[https://matthiasott.com Matthias] improved his [[service worker]], which now works better and also shows available pages when offline (similar to {{adactio}} above). He also demoed his new [[CraftCMS]] plugin to send sites to the [[Internet Archive]]: https://github.com/matthiasott/internetarchive

== Aaron Parecki ==
{{aaronpk}} improved [[OwnYourSwarm]]: There is now a fallback mode for Micropub endpoints which can't handle full checkin posts and now can request a simple [[note]] for the checkin instead. He also fixed bugs on [indieauth.com] and improved the [authorization-endpoint] specification.
He nearly finished support for offline checkins in [[OwnYourSwarm]].
