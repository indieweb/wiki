== Notes ==

It is a struggle to find functional pretty personal website designs. Particulary for indieweb websites

Suggested Sites

* http://eliseblaha.typepad.com
** photography heavy
** looks like CMS but isn't
** archives are entirely by category
* http://brennannovak.com (down - looked at it via archive.org)
** essay pages - black text on white background. good line-height/whitespace. good contrast on links.
* http://cleverdevil.io
** homepage only shows long-form writing and photo posts
** big background image, just for flavor
** maps are the default from withknown - clean grayscale leaflet maps
* http://aaronparecki.com/2017/06/
** calendar view w/ lots of icons. lots of moon icons that made people think of "coexist"
* http://seblog.nl/2017/06/
** calendar view w/ icons. also shows reacji.
* http://grant.codes
** splash page text anomation
** lots of movement!
** grant.codes/timeline - map on the background moves as you scroll back through the timeline! (http://owntracks.org for data, leaflet map updates as page scrolls to location embedded in post at the top of the view)
* http://andy-j-miller.com
** cute text w/ hand-drawn appearance and subtle animation
** full of super colorful images (he is an illustrator)
* http://www.adhamdannaway.com/
** interesting split face header
* http://v4.jasonsantamaria.com
** uniq designs for each post.
** archive includes things like the main color for the post's design (e.g. "yellow")
** also includes thumbnail screenshots of the articles
** looks very like print design
* http://trentwalton.com
** articles look a lot like medium.com
* http://kartikprabhu.com
** lots of custom indentation and other whitespace manipulation
* http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/
** super custom scrolling overrides, incl video backgrounds fading in and out
* https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/design-conference/
** bloomberg was like "we get design. and we hate it. and you." (very tongue-in-cheek)
* archive page (I'm biase but like it :) https://gregorlove.com/archives/
** archives by month, each day looks like a calendar box, but to 5 per row.
* http://hansbrinker.com/
** very print-like block printing design
** anomalily: side-to-side scrolling elements can be interesting on "my day" sites
* https://theoutline.com/

* http://ncase.me/fireflies/
* gRegor http://designbyproxy.com
* http://shauninman.com
** links try to follow the cursor as you mouse over/out, then snap back.
** also has an 8-bit archive http://shauninman.com/pact/
** Screenshot of another landing page: https://www.flickr.com/photos/unmatchedstyle/4553686703
** Shaun’s blog used to slowly change background colour over time. Screenshots:

* http://keithjgrant.com
** beautiful subtle animations in the menus
** super neat text title effects (background shows through, some kind of blend mode)
* CSS text effects (semantic HTML + CSS - and some SVG - works in most browsers) https://codepen.io/collection/DamKJW/
* http://jimramsden.com
** that landing animation, wooww.

aggregator: http://www.verynicesites.com/ <== basically this session in a nutshell

Jonathan: A lot of websites look very similar.

Animation (specifically use of gifs)?
* used to be a big part of the web

Let's end with zombo.com (or http://html5zombo.com/ )

Fun terrible UI design: http://www.creativebloq.com/inspiration/bad-volume-sliders-are-a-masterclass-in-terrible-ui-design

Which of these two websites are you designing: https://twitter.com/jongold/status/694591217523363840?lang=en

Good looking Podcast Pages
* http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/
* http://insertuser.nl
** the player is crazy! bouncing text and floating links. moves the page around as you listen.
* http://geekouts.xyz
** live scrolling and highlighting transcript as audio plays. also allows jumping playback by clicking on the text.

TODOs:
* https://hotlinewebring.club/ - looks like it's run by jkphl? we should ask him to make an indiewebring.club??
