== Notes ==
mechanisms that have existed in the past

* Webring - similar sites can link to each other 
* Blogrolls

silos took over the discovery and finding new things

how can we do this in a decentralized way?

http://rivva.de - aggregator
* tracked which blogs were talking to each other
* also aggregates twitter mentions of certain URLs on the site

bloggers.scripting.com
* aggregates different RSS feeds that he follows
* whitelisted list of blogs

How can we help find other people writing about similar things?

"Who to follow?"

* usually not useful
* tom: usually follow people when someone else retweets a tweet

follow-your-nose
* from your followers to people they're following
* potential danger is creating an echo chamber and not finding people outside that

adactio.com/links
* linkblog pattern
* whole earth catalog, an early example of this pattern

ways to submit things to aggregators
* opt-in via choosing categories, e.g. wordpress categories
* automatic keyword search across all posts, might mixing worlds, not what people expect

hosting one that anyone can add to, vs hosting one where only you post to
* e.g. host a linkblog, vs host a hackernews instance

likely that community hubs will be small, because people will want to be self-organizing into smaller communities in response to the growth of twitter/facebook
