* Watch: {{videoduration|link=https://youtu.be/HOUmN4G8RUs?t=1h10m58s|duration=25:07}}
** Note this starts at the project ideas timestamp, but there's a long period of background talking earlier in the video

== Notes ==
=== Manton Reece ===
{{manton}} wants to work on [[micro.blog]] parsing webmentions to make sure there's nothing it missed, showing replies correctly, [[post-type-discovery]] type things

May follow up with some of the [[Micropub]] extension things discussed on day 1.

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} was inspired by the payment session. Going to try to get the new [[Payment Request API]] working

Stretch goal: improve documentation on micropub requests. Create micropub examples for each type of [[posts]], remove examples from [[Micropub]] and instead link to each individual section.

=== Tantek Ã‡elik ===
{{t}} wants to implement the number feature on his [[pay]] for requesting specific payment amounts (like {{aaronpk}}'s site)

Also would like to implement the [[Payment Request API]] from the perspective of someone who has never worked with [[Stripe]].

Work on [[person-tag-of]] posts

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} already did his first hack day project today. Made an IndieWeb workflow for [[Alfred]] to open wiki pages. https://martymcgui.re/2017/12/10/111432/

Other major thing he would like to do is work on the site-building parts of his [[static site]]. Would like to use more microtools that use [[building blocks]] like [[Micropub]], Micropub edits, [[WebSub]] notifications.

Smaller goal will be to improve [[WebSub]] notifications

=== Tom Brown ===
{{tbbrown}} is going to work on [[IndieAuth]] to add login to an existing project.

=== Chris Grayson ===
First thing he wanted to do was get [[IndieAuth]] working and he already did that, including [[pgp]] support.

Wants to see if he can get [[OwnYourGram]] working

=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} wants to work on posting [[bookmark]]s from his phone directly to his site.
