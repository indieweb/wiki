Hello PERSONNAME! Only a couple more days before we all come together for IndieWebCamp Austin! I am very much looking forward to the weekend, and I hope you all have a fantastic time while you're in Austin.

We still have a few spots left on the guest list, so invite a friend, co-worker, or two with a personal site (or who has said they want one!). They can register at https://2017.indieweb.org/austin

Here are a few last pieces of information before we meet. You may want to save this update so you can refer to it as you make your way to Austin for the festivities.

==== General Schedule ====

Saturday will be a day of discussions, starting off with introductions and demos before lunch, and the rest of the day reserved for discussion sessions that will be proposed and lead by participants like you! We'll wrap at 5:00pm for some social time.

Sunday is a making / hacking day - time to put some of those ideas from Saturday into action! New designs, add features to (or starting building) your personal website, and help others do the same. 

We'll have sponsored lunch brought in on Sunday, followed by more hacking. We'll close out with a round of demos before cleaning up and closing camp around 5:00pm.

You can find the [https://indieweb.org/2017/Austin#Schedule full schedule on the wiki].
