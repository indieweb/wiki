== Notes ==
MicroPub spec is currently about creating posts and editing assumes you already know what you are editing.

Indieweb.org/micropub-brainstorming
indieweb.org/micropub-extension

Review of XML-RPC protocol, which Manton is using to retrieve posts. 

editing use cases:
* quick edits to recent posts
* editing old posts is usually not a time-sensitive thing or needs to be done from a mobile app

MetaWebLog API that micro.blog supports

metaWeblog.newPost
metaWeblog.editPost
metaWeblog.deletePost
metaWeblog.getPost
metaWeblog.getRecentPosts
metaWeblog.newMediaObject

* API to get recent posts - reverse chronological published date
* bonus if that API supports paging for older posts
* get list of categories - not all sites support this
* autocomplete for tags

q=config
* could also include list of categories
* should probably return everything the client needs for setup


Should a server return all properties of a post or just name/date/url? 
* option for both, similar to existing q=source

querying venues?
* community venue database?
* can you query someone else's venue database from their website?
