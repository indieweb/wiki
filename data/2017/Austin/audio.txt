* {{gRegor}} (remote)
* {{GWG}}
* {{manton}}
* {{addyourself}}

== Notes ==
=== Marty Maguire ===
* {{martymcguire}} Created a micropub client called [[Screech]],
* Been doing interviews....for This Week in Indieweb podcast
* Generates video of audio with subtitles
* BBC Version that supports videos
* Looking for tools around captioning, automated tools so so
* Shortcut from FeelTrain folks on GitHub https://github.com/FeelTrainCoop/shortcut
* {{aaronpk}} has talked about automating some of his editing set up for creating podcasts/microcasts (in his Percolator podcast)

=== Manton Reece ===
{{manton}} does his podcast more "traditionally" 
[https://auphonic.com/ Auphonic] - The automatic audio post production webservice, using signal processing and machine learning techniques.

Media Fragments is a browser spec supported by most browsers
* aaronpk got a javascript going and {{martymcguire}} implemented it too.

== Areas for improvement ==
=== Production ===
* editing

=== Consumption ===
* Audio Reader
* Smartwatch wearers - swiping up for interface with one's nose and then nose-tap to pause
** Micropub functionality from watch to website
* OPML support for transporting listen lists of podcasts

=== Discovery ===
* [[Huffduffer]]
** It would br great if Huffduffer aggregated the total bookmarks of files to indicate popularity.
* How can we do an IndieWeb replacement for iTunes???!!!!
** IndieNews for audio perhaps?
** Use of [[microsub]] protocol for subscribing
* How can we improve discovery?
* Apple recently bought Shazam... 
* {{gRegor}}: [[Wavelist]] is a curated podcast playlist service by {{benwerd}}. Not sure the current status of it.

{{martymcguire}} It would be cool if Bridgy could backfeed iTunes, Overcast reviews to one's site.

{{chrisaldrich}} if more sites supported webmention, then one could potentially like segments of podcasts with media fragments. This would make it easier for podcasts (I'm thinking of Leo Laporte and TWit) to make end-of-year best of shows.

* Reading.am pulls in audio mp3s and marks them as [[listen|listens]] instead of [[read|reads]]. If you send them a raw .mp3 URL, it displays an audio player directly on the page.  {{chrisaldrich}} uses IFTTT to pull these listens from Reading.am into his WordPress site.

"HyperAudio" is a term for the kind of AV/text sync: https://hyperaud.io and tools like Trint: https://trint.com
* An example of JS that implements this is here: https://github.com/vitorio/hyperaudio-lite with links to some sync and competing tools in the description, and a live example where every word in the transcript seeks to the appropriate place in the audio file
HTML5 media fragments are the #t anchors referenced: https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video#Specifying_playback_range
