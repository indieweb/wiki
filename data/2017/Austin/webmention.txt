== Notes ==
[[Webmentions]] are posts that show up on other people’s sites, often comments

webmention.rocks is good for debugging
The bare minimum for a webmetnion is a link

# Start with a blank webpage
# Link to the post you’re replying to.
# Discover, find their webmention endpoint. Link tag with a rel="webmention" in their head or a link header. Use curl for testing
# Add microformats to the post

* Can link an h-entry to another url in order to have author info available, but hidden from view, requires x-ray currently
* Data element is a good way to hide h-card elements if not wanted to be visible. Better than using display: none or empty links
* Need more tools to simplify this for users
* Webmention is an evolution of pingback
* More testing required to deal with potential spam
