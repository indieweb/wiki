neotoma.io

pesos all the things - usual suspects, but in ideal version, bank records, health records, etc

connect it to various different sync systems (e.g. dropbox, google drive)

sync everything from existing silos, get it into your storage, put a web front end over the top of it
could be a simple way of getting people into the indieweb


Flo: wants a personal api - nextcloud is a bit hacky
cozy cloud(?) - can run it on a raspberry pi
want to get data in from facebook/twitter
running couchdb
involves some work with the router

neotoma has json file for each piece of content pesos'ed 
flat file approach

daply - hard drive in your house which consolidates all your own media

are we motivated by backup or by self-publishing?

facebook, twitter, foursquare, all have pretty robust apis for pulling data back
q: are they rate limited though?
e.g. 10 year old FB account, with 5000 photos, 50 on each page, that's only 100 requests - then get the photos from a given url

it's been challenging because been trying to build it in a service agnostic way, each service does everything in a different way
need an adapter for each service

sometimes 3rd party service has a nicer user interface - can be a reason for using PESOS

swarm is a good app for checking in, but it isn't a great way for visualising - can have a nicer way of viz for your own site

good reason for having separation of presentation and data - you can then do with your data what you want to e.g. perform analytics on it 

when rdio died people had to migrate their lists of what music they liked to new platforms

business model?  currently all open source, but could move to a wordpress.org / wordpress.com model eventually
