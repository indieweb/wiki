What do people use now?
* Feed readers
* Twitter/Facebook

plumbing likely can be solved (adapting feed formats, silos)

different use cases for long-form feeds vs microblog-like things

what people want for social:
* publishing, like/reply
* clearer display of person writing content -> more important (twitter/FB like display)
* learning filters, getting rid of noise and pulling out important things (maybe adapt spamfiltering)
* recommendation engine could be outside and network with others
