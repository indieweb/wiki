* {{martijnvdven}}
* {{doubleloop}}
* add your names

== Notes ==

* silos
* site deaths * hard to get your data back after a site death
* long list of services that already died on the indieweb wiki
* indieweb grew out of frustration at the web becoming centralized
* encouraged from the beginning people getting hands on
* indieweb is about your entity
* publish content to your own website
* can still use silos to keep networks, but start with your own stie and distribute out
* indieweb principles * https://indieweb.org/principles
* in short: own your stuff yourself, share openly, have fun, scratch your own itch and eat your own dogfood


Basic indieweb tech

* using the persona of 'Tom'
* on his way to the indieweb
* indiemark
* a way of describing how far down the indieweb path
* different axes (e.g. identity, auth, post, syndication, etc)
* level 1
* get your own domain
* get indieauth working
* indieauth * authentication service, personal domain as identifier (don't use username/password)
* can work with multiple authentication mechanisms (e.g. delegate to any oauth provider)
* all you need is rel=me markup * links your profile to different services (e.g. twitter, github) * two way link
* some name confusion * there's a difference between indieauth and indieauth.com (also relmeauth)
* then you can log in to e.g. indieweb.org with your domain name

building blocks * html and microformats
* we're not tied into specific tools, anything that works with html and microformats

back to tom
* permalinks: everything published can be reached with own unique URL
* more microformats: for information about what you have in your blog post
* e.g. h-entry, u-url, p-name
* microformats easy to use as it builds on top of css classes
* having these enables parsers to parse out things about your content

* searchability * non-restrictive robots.txt

"if you can't cURL it, it's not on the web"
(which means javascript can cause issues)

Tom's now at Indiemark level 1.

Now let's try level 2.

* contact information in home page with microformats
* (aside: let's try to include pronoun more)
* content: multiple post types
* syndication: distribute to applicable silos
* POSSE (publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere)
* PESOS (publish elsewhere, syndicate to your own site) * need it for some silos like instagram

other things at level 2 * not covering here


indiemark level 3: 

* webmentions
* remember pingbacks? supercedes this
* a way of communicating between sites
* signal to sites that someway has 'mentioned' you
* can be used for a lot of things
* e.g. saying that you're attending an event
* question: do you have to implement it all yourself?
* you can use 3rd party tools to help you with this like telegraph
* there are receiving endpoints too e.g. webmention.io
* webmention is just the principle, you can implement it with different tech as you prefer
* when you get a webmention, now microformats helps you to parse the content where you were mentioned (if you want to do something with it on your own site)

we might have recently just seen the first instance of webmention spam in the wild.

there's lots more tech and principles to indieweb, but we'll move on now to indieweb generations.


IndieWeb Generations

* 1 * dev leaders
* 2* journalists and bloggers
* 3 * personal domains managed by 3rd parties
* 4* people using social networks

we're now in the phase of indieweb generation 2.
onboarding is now important, how we get more people involved in the community, help people get indiewebified.
explain why it's important to have your own identity, get away from silos.

bonus section:
brid.gy is a really useful service
connect it to your social media accounts
it polls every couple of minutes for e.g. replies
when it finds them, it sends it as a webmention to your website
