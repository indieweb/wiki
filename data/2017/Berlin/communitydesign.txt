'''<dfn>Community design</dfn>''' was was a session at [[2017/Berlin|Indiewebcamp Berlin]] discussing how to create a feeling of community across indie web pages.

How to connect IndieWeb pages?

 *what ideas do we have to create a distributed network experience, vs. the feeling of islands on the web
* there is a reason fb, twitter etc. are so popular: they create the feeling of community
* we want ot see the social context

have efforts been done to link websites to other indieweb sites?
* could be an area on the site that shows conversations going on with you

{{jeena}} two parts to it:
* seeing conversations themselves (webmentions etc)
*  seeing the social context; we don't have anything in this direction so far (apart from IRC people page)

what twitter/instagram are showing::
*who the person is interensted in
*who are interested in that person
*what dialogies do they have
*--> maybe we could have some similar experience

following per se is anonymous on the web
--> could it be optional?

ideas:
* list of interactions
* demo of indieweb social at portland iwc (incoming/outgoing links; limitatioN. only captures the active "followers", not those who are just reading not interacting)
* number of rss subscribers
* explicit "i am following you" post type?
** e.g. "to express your status as follower, like my homepage"
** show more content to users logging in, eg. through indieauth (preconsitiond would be working private posting)
* ompl lists
** not usually public
** people could publish their ompl files to show whom they are following
* XFN, see indieweb.org/XFN
** could be in addition to OMPL
* resembles the 2007 attempts (Tim Berners-Lee etc.) to establish a semantic gloabl social graph on the web; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_(ontology)

semantics apart, but how do you show it?
- what does the bare bare relationship model bring us?
- google took a nosedive with that: "circles"
- 

{{jeena}} has a separate list of comments on his site; not nice to look at, but a comprehensive list of comments

a fb profile page shows not only the users posts, but also things otherss ahve done in reation to that person, eg tagging them in a picture
* we have mechanisms to do this, but not much used:
** salmentions https://indieweb.org/salmentions
** SWAT0 https://indieweb.org/swat0

oliver: motivation problem
* people willing to pay to find out who is following them
* people very reserved as to their own following patterns to be public
* e.g. twitters forced puublicity of followers affects the interactions happending on twitter
* the network increases itself

{{sgreger}} there is also a risk that we are loosing some of the freedoms that the oepn we provides vs. eg twitter: i can follow somebody without telling anybody

privacy issues with tagging
* would it possible to be tagged out from e.g. SWAT0?
* implicit vs. static relationship

open question at the end: does the relationship need to be automatic or manual?
