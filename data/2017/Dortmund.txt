'''<dfn>IndieWeb at <a href="http://campfirefestival.org" target="_blank">‚ÄúCAMPFIRE‚Äù</a></dfn>''', one of several IndieWebCamp [[events]] in 2017! <br />
We want to leave the fustiness. Let's make experiencing the good aspects of journalism attractive and striking for everyone. Bands will play and DJ's will perform evening long.

We want to learn and celebrate with you. <br />We gather around a kind of big camp fire, where our stories come to life.


The CAMPFIRE Festival is not an expert conference, but a three-day festival for everyone who is curious:
'''Join us on Friday and Saturday in a combined tent with <a href="https://www.chaostreff-dortmund.de"><abbr style="border:0" title="Chaos Treff Dortmund">CCC</abbr></a> and <a href="https://codefor.de/ruhrgebiet/">Code for Germany</a> !'''

The importance for journalists of digital authorship, ownership and syndication is getting more awareness. We want to host a special tent as a kind of ‚ÄúOpen Space‚Äù with a particular emphasis on [[Indieweb_for_Journalism|journalism]] with use cases for journalists, photographers, editors, related bloggers and platforms which are publishing their work.
Learn how to use the [[building blocks]] (see also [[2017/building-blocks|2017]]) to empower media and encourage everybody to own their own content and identities.

Let's discuss how to share content and what is needed and what-not. <br />

To foster the next [[generations|generation]] of potential Indieweb adopters who may be focused on areas of news, journalism, or distribution, we want to compile some specific hints, tips, pointers, and examples which may be germane to these particular audiences to assist in their motivation and adoption.
The tent is open and engaged all Friday and Saturday :
