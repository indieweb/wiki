=== Mark Hendrickson ===
I'm [[User:Markmhendrickson.com|Mark Hendrickson]], http://markmhendrickson.com, a designer / developer / PM for startups originally from San Francisco but now living in Barcelona, Spain for a few years now. My main IndieWeb project is Neotoma (https://github.com/neotoma), a PESOS-style consumer app to empower users to easily sync all of their silo data historically and going forward to their cloud storage of choice (Dropbox etc).

=== Martijn van der Ven ===
I‚Äôm {{Zegnat}}, http://vanderven.se/martijn/. I am probably better known as just Zegnat here on the chat. I have a task list up on http://wiki.zegnat.net/iws-task-list for this weekend. I also host the Virtual [[Homebrew Website Club]] on CEST time (upcoming Wednesday people!)

Planning to do a lot of community wrangling and outreach to organisers, so if that is something you are interested in helping with hit me.

=== Calum Ryan ===
I‚Äôm {{calumryan}}, http://calumryan.com. I‚Äôve written my own CMS in PHP for notes and IndieWeb features like sending [[Webmention]]s and [[Micropub]] for Instagram/Swarm.

I‚Äôm {{jonnybarnes}}, my site is at http://jonnybarnes.uk, it's written with the [[Laravel]] framework.
