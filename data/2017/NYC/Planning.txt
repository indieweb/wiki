=== Update 1 ===
* date: 2017-09-28

Hello PERSONNAME! Only a couple more days before we all come together for IndieWebCamp NYC! I am very much looking forward to the weekend, and I hope you all have a fantastic time while you're in New York City.

We still have a few spots left on the guest list, so invite a friend, co-worker, or two with a personal site (or who has said they want one!). They can register at https://2017.indieweb.org/nyc

Here are a few last pieces of information before we meet. You may want to save this update so you can refer to it as you make your way to NYC for the festivities.

==== Weather ====

Things have been cooling off in New York City. The temperature should range between the high-50s and high-60s, with a bit of light rain expected early Sunday morning and late Sunday afternoon.

[[File:iwc-nyc-2017-darksky-forecast.png]]

==== General Schedule ====

Saturday will be a day of discussions, starting off with introductions and demos before lunch, and the rest of the day reserved for discussion sessions that will be proposed and lead by participants like you! We'll wrap at 5:00pm for some social time.

Sunday is a making / hacking day - time to put some of those ideas from Saturday into action! New designs, add features to (or starting building) your personal website, and help others do the same. 

We'll have sponsored lunch brought in on Sunday, followed by more hacking. We'll close out with a round of demos before cleaning up and closing camp around 5:00pm.

You can find the [https://indieweb.org/2017/NYC#Schedule full schedule on the wiki].

==== What to Work On? ====

Not sure what to work on at IndieWebCamp? Here are some ideas:

* making your site "you" on the web (working on your identity, domain, design)
* owning what you post (improving how you post to your site, how your posts look)
* reaching your friends, colleagues, co-workers (where to [https://indieweb.org/POSSE POSSE])
* owning your conversations (replying/liking/reposting from your site, and showing comments/responses to your posts, including [https://indieweb.org/backfeed backfeed] from POSSE copies)

Need ideas? Or already got ideas?

==== Getting Around ====

Dalberg Global Development Advisors is at 99 Madison Avenue (29th & Madison) on the 17th floor. The doors will open at 10:00am on Saturday and Sunday.

There may or may not be a security guard who will let people in, so we will have a sign with info about who to contact to be let in.

You can always give us a shout in [https://indieweb.org/irc/today#bottom the #indieweb chat] and someone will come down to let you in!

==== Public Transit ====

There are a couple of [http://www.mta.info/ MTA subway] stops near the venue, with service from the 4, 6, N, Q, R, and W trains. You can buy a [http://web.mta.info/metrocard/ Metrocard] with cash or credit/debit card at most MTA subway stations. The fare is $2.75 per ride.

==== Remote Participation ====

We expect to have people participating remotely who couldn't come to NYC this year. We'll have two rooms set up with cameras and microphones for streaming and perhaps screen sharing. More information and the relevant links are [https://indieweb.org/2017/NYC#Summary on the wiki].

==== Join the Chat ====

If you haven't already, join our [https://chat.indieweb.org/slack Slack room] or [https://indieweb.org/discuss IRC channel] (they're connected) and introduce yourself! We'll be using the chat during the event to take notes, share links, and communicate with the remote participants.

==== Code of Conduct ====

As a reminder, we have a [https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct Code of Conduct] that applies to IndieWeb spaces both online and offline.
