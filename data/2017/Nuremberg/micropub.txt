== Notes ==
* How can we quickly make posts on my site without copying files around
* Other people can build better interfaces, but I want to use them with my site - e.g. an iPhone app
* https://quill.p3k.io/ is aaronpk's micropub client reference implementation

=== What do we need? ===
* Authorization endpoint that controls who may post to your site
* Token endpoint is plumbing only
* Micropub endpoint is storing the posts to your site
** static site - micropub endpoint would need to creat those files
* media endpoint for storing things like images to go with posts

=== How do we do it? ===
* POST request with a number of parameters
* endpoint would need to use that data to create the static file or save to database
** Known stores webmentions in database as posts
* What if my website needs a different set of data?
** A Micropub server will except anything that follows the microformat structure. If your website needs undocumented data, there is nothing in the Micropub specification that will stop you from sending it.

=== Identity ===
* How can we give people one-off identities? Or allow them to login to places without owning a domain?

=== Logout security ===
* quill is still able to post to my site when I logout from quill
* I have to remove quill from my authorized application list
* it is not possible to force an application to tell the access token endpoint that a user signed out. that's also not in the spec currently
* oauth is the same, and indieauth is based on oauth

=== Documentation issues ===
* Authentication vs authorisation is particularly hard to explain.
** How to make it clear what block is meant when saying “authorisation server”?
* Token based auth.
** Questions come up, but how much should IndieWeb document about OAuth?
** Can questions about token validity be left unanswered?
** What is “plumbing”, what is important for onboarding?
