== Notes ==
Markus wants to store pictures in a way that is accessible in 10, 15 years time. 

Having an archive that you want to get online, can be a block for doing it at all.

Jeremy just posted photo's on his site. Does less care about the archive, still hasn't figures that out.

It's just a filesystem. S3.

Flickr has a nice way to organise.

ParallelFlickr is a tool (in Python) to achive that same way of organising.

Photographers really store all the tags in the photo. (EXIF data.) As soon as possibl, because you will forget.
