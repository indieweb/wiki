=== Promotion & Discovery ===
* meetup.com - facebook of events

*** berlin paid for half a year, but want to move off
*** you pay per event
*** 50 people that are ''interested'', not 50 actual members or people that come to an event
** new groups/events published on meetup.com because many people get notfied about that
** years agoÂ  xing was used for that
* eventbrite.com
** for discovery
* upcoming.org

why meetup?
* useful to find new events one might be interested in
* RSVP functionality

idea
* idea: use meetup to get people to your website
* still pay for more that 50 interested people

twitter
* get retweeted by events-in-your-city account if there is one

=== Recruiting ===
: How to get people interested into HWC outside of indiewebcamps?

* jeremy tweets events, mentions people
** do not use the wiki. it will put people off
** london has own website, uses webmention RSVP

=== RSVP ===
* London: https://calumryan.com/event/hwc-20170503/
** shows RSVPs
* NL: no own site, but sometimes events on organiser's site
** https://seblog.nl/2017/01/11/1/homebrew-website-club
* Berlin: URL with RSVP?
** http://svenknebel.de/temp/hwc

RSVP for non-techies without homepage
* https://commentpara.de is an anonymous silo for comments (future) RSVP, could be used to micropub-publish by everyoe
* or just in local comments
* Quill https://quill.p3k.io supports RSVP when it detects an event
** URL parameter to reply to > https://quill.p3k.io/new?reply=https://indieweb.org/events/2017-03-22-homebrew-website-club
** URL parameter to login at
** -> automatically sign in for non-techies

Do RSVP matter?

is an attendee list helping?
* no
** people showing up is important
** if only few people are on the list, people are less likely to come
** jeremy is doing it even if he is alone
* yes
** see that people are coming
** social proof that people are coming
** cancel event if nobody is coming

setup
* jeremy: meeting room
* london: tech-focused hotel/user space/cafe
* san francisco: mozilla office
* berlin: cafe/bar
* php usergroup leipzig: coworking space meeting room, fixed date time each month


* eventbrite also for discovery
