== Notes ==

Initial motivations for participating in session:
* target group of personal blog includes people not using "traditional" web tools (rss, indie reader, twitter)
* [[email]] is used by everybody
* easy way to reach people
* increasing popularity of e-mail [[newsletter]]s, particularly in web scene
* indieweb site as a tool for newsletter/zine-style publishing
** creating content on the web feed
** semi-automated generation of a "zine"
* people's ability to permanently scan other websites is limited
* possibility to subscribe sparse "publication" from a source that has valuable information and is trustworthy



# traditionally newspapers relevant because of the redactional filter
# liberation "it is great to publish/read everything"
# renaissance of curated publications?



important difference: active/passive
* thing on the web i need to pick up
* email comes to me (i once decided to subscribe, now i don't need to worry about it)
* [[Twitter]] is a stream that runs past ("llike a firefighter's hose that you can take into your mouth or not")
* related topic: notifications
** now also possible in the browser
** possibilities on/off
** twitter "moments": user can aggregate reader-centric collections of tweets
* attitude as the pubisher is different:
** here's my newsletter - i have curated this for you
** vs. web: here's my stuff, i push it to my site and you can go read it if you want
* sending frequency is crucial design aspect

other differentiating aspect of e-mail:
* email has two content compontent: subject and message content
* this is similar in most feed readers
** very efficient way to go through large amounts of information at once
** reason for popularity of feed readers with power users
* twitter does not provide this
* allows pre-screening for the reader
* in social media silos often images serve to attract interest rather than a "subject line" in emails

big benefit:
* decentralized

posting by e-mail
* not used much
* [[WordPress]] enables posting-by-mail
* github enables reply-by-mail and adds mail as comment to issue

feedback loop on e-mail?
* link to a url that registers a "like"

privacy aspect
* tracking should be kept to a minimum
* carefully evaluate collection of personally identifiable data (opens/clicks) in the emails

html vs plain e-mails
* how to make plain text from html? (problems e.g. with hyperlinks indicated by footnotes)

Provocative question: what does e-mail have to do with indieweb? > email as distribution channel?
* email as a posse syndication channel:
* sending to various target groups
* targeting possibilities?
* every post separate or aggregate e-mails
* unclear how "this week on the indieweb"-email is created (manual component in the workflow?)


other ideas:
* [[bookmark|bookmarking]] via e-mail: sending urls to indie bookmarking system

sgreger plans to use https://sendy.co/ to send mails
