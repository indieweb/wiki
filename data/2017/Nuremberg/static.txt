* dominic
* amber
* cweiske
* tobi

== Notes ==
=== why static ===
* no running code on the server, no plugins, no security problems
* no maintenance
* speed - pages do not have to generated on request

=== what needs to be dynamic? ===
* sending webmentions
* receiving webmentions
* search
* display comments and likes

=== why webmentions ===
* feedback even after months

=== webmentions ===
==== receiving ====
* https://webmention.io/
* pelle wesmann receives webmentions and re-generates his website then

==== sending ====
* cweiske uses stapibas that sends webmentions to links in his feed

=== what is "dynamic"? ===
* is next day enough?
* dominic: if it isn't nearly instant, don't have comments. no discussion otherwise
** slow conversations vs. ideas bouncing around
* long posts don't require instant comments
* twitter-sized posts only thrive through instant comment display

=== problems with webmentions / comments ===
* moderation takes time

=== problems with jekyll ====
* ruby, hard to install
* webmentiont theme required multiple plugins that did not work with each other or the ruby versions required by the other plugins
* alternative: hyde, used by sebastian

=== idea for static+dynamic comments ===
1. use webmention.io to display fresh comments via javascript
2. fetch comments from there when rebuilding static page, bake them into the generated site
3. webmention.io can go down, and one would only lose comments since last build of the site

=== text serialization: HTML or markdown? ===
* some use markdown
* some HTML
* markdown is limiting
* HTML is sometimes too heavy, when you want to concentrate on writing

=== where to run dynamic things? ===
* own server
* online service
* at home
