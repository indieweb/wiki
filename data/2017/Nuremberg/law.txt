== Notes ==
* Jan: Motivation for Session:
** implementing webmention comment display
** it fetches stuff from another site without permission, how does that work with copyright?
* traditional comments are clearly made on a site, not transfered
* idea: create specific "license" to allow

* example: leistungsschutzrecht for news. Some newspapers opt out to be linked
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_copyright_for_press_publishers

*sebastianlasse: In terms of such vocabulary properties these 12 are the concencus in "media" http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/

* scope of licenses is interesting. For encoding it on pages rel= exists, but licenses entire page (e..g. design. might not be wanted)
* microformat could do this for parts of a page, e.g. text

* could we just get started by including u-license in our webmentions
* u-license would add license to a particular h-entry or h-card
* rel="license" can still be used for licenseing an entire page (this then includes also the visuals, design, frontend code etc.?)
 
* Interesting note on #law, Tantek puts a text on his Facebook that informs commenters that comments might be mirrored on his site.

* GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation
** What services would be covered? Bridgy?
** Anyone parsing personal data (which, according to EU includes email addresses), which parsing h-card is, would need to stick to GDPR.
 

=== Brainstorm Mark-up ===

* http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license - applies to the entire page, as documented.
* http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license-issues - issues have also been documented already.
* Brainstorming has already happened on http://microformats.org/wiki/licensing

There are IDs for licenses: https://spdx.org/licenses/

=== todos ===
what properites of a post are needed to be used
adactio: shows always URL, if h-entry if applicable title, content. if h-card: show name, NOT photo
calum: url, content excerpt/summary, title?
aaronpk: authorname, photo, link, title, first +500chars of content if no name (some html is allowed in comments)
sgreger: full text if webmention, excerpt otherwise
jeremycherfas: text, no photo
again, difference bridgy/non-bridgy

* What would need to be licensed?
** URL should never be under copyright, http://academlib.com/4261/law/web_links_just_urls_copyrightable
** Content (this includes titles) are part of a work, and are definitely copyrightable.
*** Using an excerpt makes a fair use argument more obvious, but is still using copyrightable text.
** Photo. Is complicated. Copyright, by default, goes to the person who made the photo. That might not even be the person who owns the h-card.
** Names should not be copyrightable. Names are, however, personal information. This means the identified person might still hold rights over your usage of the name.
*** Laws like GDPR and several local right-to-be-forgotton laws could apply.
