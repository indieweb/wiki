* Sebastiaan Andeweg
* Sven Knebel

== Notes ==
* posts normally public -> webmention works
* private posts require access control. Webmention can't auth - it fails
* first “standardized” step: webmentions for private posts
* general log in for viewing posts is a bigger problem
* description of how it it works by aaronpk read up on [[private-webmention]]

Steps of this sessions:
* try to find out the security implications of the extra-code step

The webmentions queue should generate the token at the time of sending the webmention.

* what about retrying webmentions?
* What about resending webmentions?

cweiske uses [[stapibas]] to send webmentions. External component, how does it get tokens for private posts?

The 401 and possibly 403 headers should be set at a dynamic place, but for static sites it can be done at the server (Apache, Ngnix) layer.


verification has to be done fast, problematic with queues

Later steps:
* make a matrix of implementations talking to other implementations
