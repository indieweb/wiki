[[2017]] hack session follow-up from [[2017/refresh]]

Building on pain points and problems that we're trying to solve that were mentioned in the session:

"Your thoughts. Your words. Your photos. Your voice - It's your content, keep it." (I didn't catch who said that last phrase)

I almost see it like a owning a digital lending library. '''You''' decide who gets to check out, or borrow, your content (silo) but it's still available for ''everyone'' to read.


== Things IndieWeb can help with ==
I feel we should call out and address hurdles that Gen2 and above face and can get frustrated with:
* Silo algorithm changes (what they show you in their "reader" / "stream" / "news feed")
* Obstruction of sharing between "silos" from within
* Can be, or become, "unfindable" by Google & Bing
* Will still be available if you leave, or are forced to leave 
* Will still be available if they close
* Will still be around if they change business model (Medium)

== Avoid ==
Also, some things that we should start avoiding as we offer a helping hand outside our community:
*'''Do not''' call them silos. Name them. People don't think of Facebook and Twitter as a "silo"
*'''Do not''' hide that Instagram won't let you publish from "outside"
*'''Do not''' use the term "dogfooding" - People outside tech don't get it. Sounds gross ;-)


== Concerns ==
* Does this help with security?
* Does it cost (money)? An allure is the "free-ness" of silo's
* Does it cost (time)?
* It '''does not''' just work (at the moment)
* Will it make sense when syndicated? Looks like a Facebook post/Tweet.
