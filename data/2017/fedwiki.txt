== Notes ==
Ward created Federated Wiki six years ago, inspired by IndieWeb. He finds that people have a hard time getting started, so he wants to give us a hand! Just go to <yourname>.tries.fed.wiki and create your wiki page.

You will have to (a) click the padlock in the lower left to "claim" the wiki (associate it with, e.g. a Google login or a Twitter login); and the click "wiki" to enter editing mode.

* "Welcome visitors" is what you get "for free," the default main page with some basic content pre-filled.
* Check out ward.tries.fed.wiki

Look at: "How to Wiki" and "Field guide to the Federation"

The initial Fed Wiki goals:
    
Smallest Federated Wiki Goals
* Demonstrate that wiki would have been better had it been effectively federated from the beginning.
* Explore federation policies necessary to sustain an open creative      community.
    
When in an edit window, if you want to learn what "plugin" you're using, type command-I (or alt-I on Windows/Linux), it's like a man page.

History shows up as a collection of icons at the bottom of each page.

Sorry, this is a pretty interactive session, so I've been having a hard time keeping up with notes while following along!

To add a wiki site to your neighborhood, open it in another browser window or tab; then drag the colored flag to your own wiki, in an edit box.

Tomorrow (June 25, 2017) is the 6yh birthday of Federated Wiki. Happy birthday to wiki!

Every Wednesday at 10am Pacific there is a Google Hangout to play with these ideas.
