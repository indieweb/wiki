* Incorporates the folowing values:
** I control my data
** I have options
*** I can leave the service without losing too much
*** I can fork
*** Reasonable assurance that nothing happens behind my back that I don't know about and cannot prevent

* Organized in a user friendly way that shows the known equivalent and then list replacements
** You should be able to send non-technical or non-developer users here

A list of existing self-hosted software solutions that could be used as a starting point:
* https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted
* https://thatoneprivacysite.net/

Categorize by:
* product vs service
* support available
* ready-to-use solution vs. assembly required

How to consume the information:
# By category, like "home security", "social media" ...
# Compare to well-known, like alternative.to
# Support status
#* Is there a support number or helpful community
# Minimizing the number of recommended options
#* Making decisions easier
