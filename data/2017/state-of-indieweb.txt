Video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoXwreuhcno&index=3&list=PLk3TtIJ31hqrLIPqz55TczawWu-30cnXM

== Talk Outline ==
Speaker's notes and links to pages & sites shown in talk.

=== Own Your Stuff ===
Our calls to action:
* own your identity
* own your data, your content
* own your everything online

=== Focus ===
https://indieweb.org/
* Your content is yours
* You are better connected
* You are in control

But really all of that starts with one goal: '''self-empowerment'''

And broadens to: '''spread empowerment'''

We are not just a set of individuals, we are a community
* work to empower ourselves
* collaborate to empower each other
* share to empower beyond those we know

[[Principles]] are all in support of that.
