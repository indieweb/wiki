Archive of '''<dfn>[[2017]] Planning</dfn>''' and organizing.

== Brainstorming ==

=== Keynotes ===
What keynotes shall we have? Brainstorm below (subjects, and speaker suggestions optional but also ok)
* What is the IndieWeb - {{aaronpk}}
* State of the IndieWeb - {{tantek}}
* A Brief History of My Website - {{anomalily}}
* Indie Map - {{snarfed}}
* tantek and aaronpk site demos

=== Leaders Summit ===
{{main|2017/Leaders}}

Similar to [[2016/Leaders]], the [[2017/Leaders|Leaders]] Summit sessions are open to everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] from 2015-2017 or at least two [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups during those years, and posted at least one meetup photo. If you're not sure, ask an [[2017#Organizers|organizer]].

=== Organizers ===
ðŸ¤“ Have you helped organize an IndieWebCamp or series of Homebrew Website Clubs and want to help out with our annual IndieWebSummit? Add yourself below, and what you'd like to / are available help do to make the summit happen:
* {{aaronpk}} - onsite in Portland
* {{t}} - all kinds of wiki things (like this page and subpages), outreach, possibly cross-promotion with related events
* ...

=== Volunteers ===
ðŸ¤— Participated in an IndieWebCamp and want to help out new folks? Or just passionate to help out any way you can? Add yourself here!
* {{martijnvdven}} - talk to Zegnat on IRC to have stuff get done.

=== Onsite Considerations ===
* food - vegetarian default
* onsite childcare (was asked about the week before [[2016]], so we should look into options, costs, possible sponsorship thereof etc.) note: we did not put this together in time for 2017 so will have to try again for next year

=== Additional Event Links ===
Need to add IndieWeb Summit 2017 to:
* Lanyrd
* W3C Other Events: https://www.w3.org/participate/otherevents/
* ...

== Notes afterwards ==
Post-summit notes to keep in mind for future events.

* This year we had 50 registrations, and ordered food for 40.
* 31 people attended on day 1, and 21 attended on day 2.
* Hot breakfast on day 1 was great, and many people ate the leftovers for lunch that day. We still had too much left over though.
* We consistently have people drop out the second day, so we can likely order less food for the second day than the first.
* We had way too many bagels for day 2 breakfast. We can probably order 1 bagel for every 2 people.
* The afternoon coffee refresh was a good idea, but it should have come around 2pm instead of 3pm. Also we didn't need as much as was ordered. The 4 coffees in the morning was a good amount, and probably needed only 2 more in the afternoon.
* An external sign out on the street would have made it easier to find.
* Several remote attendees filled out the ti.to registration, so we should make sure it's clear that the ti.to registration is just for in-person attendance.
* Some people registered on ti.to twice, a month apart. Not sure what the problem there was or how to fix it.
* We lost the beginning of the demos because Wirecast on the computer that was recording/streaming to youtube crashed. In the future, we should record the Vidyo stream in the main room as well as a backup.
* We forgot to take a group photo on day 2.
* Designate a camera-free area for people to use to type in passwords when they want to make sure they aren't being livestreamed and filmed at multiple angles
