== Final Demos ==
From chat logs: https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-05-05#t1494025623999000

=== Kartik Prabhu ===
* {{kartikprabhu}} demoing his file storage for posts on https://kartikprabhu.com/
* Stores html and json version of posts
* shows the html
* with mf2
* shows a custom h-* mf2, h-manifold-note
* his software reads that to know it's a note, not an article
* shows json
* mf2 parsed into json
* adds some empty properties, like "None" but since his software isn't looking for it, it doesn't cause problems; nice because it's not as picky as a database

=== gRegor Morrill ===
* {{gRegor}} demoing fix on gregorlove.com/events
* no upcoming events currently, but link to "past events"
* the event for this IWC Bellingham wasn't handling datetimes spanning two days
* today I fixed that: https://gregorlove.com/2017/05/indiewebcamp-bellingham/
* mf2 correctly gets the start and end date as well

=== Joe McLaughlin ===
* Joe demos joesmcl.wordpress.com
* dusted off his wordpress.com site
* orginally got the account so he could comment on LA Metro website years ago.
* with Andrew's help found out he was getting a DNS redirect from some extension that broke https access to his wordpress.com
* after all that and lunch, gRegor went through the [[rel-me]] page for adding rel-me links to Wordpress.com without a plugin
* once we got through it it was pretty easy, added rel-me to twitter, updated URL on twitter.com
* indiewebify.me didn't quite work correctly to identify his rel-me connection
* but went to indieauth.com, entered his wordpress.com site, clicked on Twitter, and I was in!
* posted a success screenshot in Slack after logging in to IndieAuth
* bought joesmcl.com this weekend
* updated DNS to point it to wordpress.com
* will be switching over to [[Drupal]] and [[CiviCRM]] when he gets more time

=== Phil Wolff ===
* (evanwolf in chat) sharing a Google Doc with us: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d4XY-SFctkdPGIBzPzxBicDvpW1o7b7y0zrOBLcq8fY/edit?usp=sharing
* "Read My Frackin Manual"
* a manual for a person
* wrote up problem statements
* e.g. I spend too much time getting other people up to speed and maybe that can be more efficient
* help others answer questions about you better like: How can I avoid triggers, how can I engage better?
* did some whiteboarding
* rough sketching of what he needs to build out
* five main sections
* capture: quick sets, pre-built collections/attributes make it very easy to dive in
* indicate on a scale how comfortable you are with things, e.g. how comfortable you are with hugging
* add you rown attributes / share your own sets
* help sort the list. What's most important to you? What doesn't matter until later in a relationship?
* if you only had 30 second elevator pitch how to tell people to interact with you, what would it be?
* connect to social, work, game, etc. networks, wherever you might want to share
* what are you sharing? how much explanation, with whom? when? for how long? under what conditions?
* publish: book form, pdf, epub of this info.
* engroup: I have a list of people, their attributes and set, can I create a composite view of them? e.g. "wow, half our people are allergic * to fish"
* listen: provide an activity stream, things to see and that you can act on.
* requests to disclose additional information
* notify when sets evolve and update your attributes / scores
* next step is story level; this has been a grand tour
* (Q from Andrew): isn't it better to do these things in conversations rather than with robotic AI?

=== Andrew Kvalheim ===
* thought a lot about what he would want to put up, didn't come to solid decisions
* wanted it to be implemented maximally declarative
* added rel-me tags to his site
* theoretically can log in with indieauth. Hasn't tested but looked fine.
* set a hastily written PR for gravatar impl on the RSVP page

=== Salt ===
* {{altsalt}} talked about altsalt.net
* main goal was to release [[Middleman]] module that pushes posts to [[Bridgy]]
* didn't really get much on that. Wrote out pseudo code for it
* did a lot of reading up on Middleman
* did a lot of not-sleeping
* brainstormed on showing RSVPs for conferences he's attended
* table layout showing whether he attended, organized, etc.
* planned not implemented, though
