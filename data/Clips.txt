'''<dfn>Clips</dfn>''' is an [[iOS]] app from [[Apple]] that lets you create video "stories" made popular by [[Snapchat]] and now copied by [[Instagram]] and [[Facebook]]. Interestingly, Clips doesn't have a built in social network, and instead allows you to share to any network or simply to save the video file to your device for sharing elsewhere. Clips can be found on the iOS app store here - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clips/id1212699939?mt=8.
