{{stub}}

'''<dfn><abbr>CRUD</abbr></dfn>''' refers to the ability to '''Create, Read, Update and Delete''' [[comments]] and [[posts]]. Also referred to specifically as "comment CRUD" or possibly "webmention CRUD". 

There are also notions of [[POSSE#CRUD|POSSE CRUD]] and [[reply-context#CRUD|reply-context CRUD]]

== Why ==
If you post a [[reply]] to another post, and possibly later update it or delete it, you should implement [[CRUD]] by sending (another) [[webmention]] to the post you've replied to so it can create, make available for reading, update, and possibly delete your comment inline on the original post.

If you support receiving [[webmentions]] and displaying [[comments]], you should implement [[CRUD]] to enable commenters to edit and delete their comments.

== How to ==
=== Create ===
* [[comment#Make_a_comment]]
* [[posts]]

=== Read ===
* [[comment#Display_a_comment_post]]
* [[comments-presentation]]

=== Update ===
* [[comment#Update_a_comment]]

=== Delete ===
* [[deleted#Handling]]
* [[comment#Delete_a_comment]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb Examples of people and their sites (and software) that support automatically updating and/or deleting their replies to others' posts, and/or receiving updates and delete webmentions from replies and updating the comments/[[interactions]] on their posts accordingly.

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} uses [[RedWind]] which supports receiving '''Update''' webmentions on kylewm.com [https://kylewm.com/2014/12/signed-up-for-huffduffer-loving-the-quietly-magic since at least 2014-12-15]. E.g. [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2014/12/15/2/ the first comment] from {{benthatmustbeme}} was updated automatically on kylewm's site when it received a second webmention:
* https://kylewm.com/2014/12/signed-up-for-huffduffer-loving-the-quietly-magic
** note that Ben's [https://twitter.com/dissolve333/status/544553156802138112 reply POSSE tweet] has the uncorrected first version of his reply to Kyle.
