2010-199 Federated Social Web Summit talk by Tantek

== sharecropping and site death ==
fast-forward to 2008-2010

itch: tired of sharecropping and site death, untrustworthy content hosting

and
* Twitter [http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2571/3927590515_c3c6be51a9_o.png fail frustrations]

scratch: DIY indie web, start with my own site
* use my site as my identity - XFN+hCard+OpenID pretty much solved this
* post tweets/notes on my own site
** syndicate out to silos - that's where my friends listen/post

http://tantek.com/

* server-based Twitter client
* called it Falcon http://tantek.pbworks.com/Falcon
* the fastest bird, when trained, can drop things off, pick things up for you

== user interface frustrations ==
itch: crappy Twitter permalink UI, etc.

http://twitter.com/t, http://twitter.com/t/status/18803073634

* inconsistent typography (sans vs. serif ?!?)
* navigation deadend
* no URL embeds
* poor auto-linking (e.g. "federatedsocialweb.net" )
* auto-shortening when not needed!

scratch: improved UI on my site
http://ttk.me/t46n3
* Helvetica - at least it's consistent
* next/prev buttons/shortcuts (arrow keys, j/k)
* easy URLs for copy/paste linking
* better auto-linking (handle URLs without http)
* better ellipsing

== URL shortener service problems ==
itches: 
* tr.im being down, [http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2616/3805043835_8cfde77dcd_o.png shutting down, going away]
* [http://mashable.com/2010/07/16/facebook-bitly-broken/ bit.ly being blocked]

scratch: my own shortener domain

http://ttk.me/

everyone should have one (in addition to their own domain of course).

go get one.


== URL shortener fragility ==
itch: url shorteners are fragile ([http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html Joshua post]), databases are fragile (database dies, IDs die)

scratch: algorithmic URL shortening 

* [http://tantek.pbworks.com/Whistle Whistle]
** what you use to call a trained Falcon
** introducing "algorithmic permashortlinks"


== non-printsafe short URLs ==
itch: non-printsafe short URL encodings
* http://search.twitter.com/search?q=bit.ly - note use of "O", "l" etc.
* print evidence: http://tantek.pbworks.com/ShortURLPrintExample

scratch: print-safe NewBase60
* http://tantek.pbworks.com/NewBase60


== writing code over and over ==
itch: tired of writing same logic front/back-end 
* http://bulletproofajax.com/

scratch: CASSIS language subset/framework
* runs native in Javascript and PHP
* http://tantek.pbworks.com/CassisProject
* http://tantek.com/cassis.js
* open source


== CASSIS proof of concept ==
itch: amazon shortlinks too long

scratch: [http://asin.cc/ ASIN.cc]

* proof of concept of CASSIS, NewBase60, algorithmic shortening


== OpenID too hard to consume ==
itch: OpenID PHP libraries too big/complex
* http://openidenabled.com/php-openid/ or http://www.janrain.com/openid-enabled

scratch: RelMeAuth - generalize form of TwitterAuth model
* http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth
* Python open source proof of concept
** http://github.com/ptarjan/relmeauth
* PHP proof of concept
** http://github.com/themattharris/relmeauth
** live prototype: http://tantek.com/relmeauth/ (was live demo: http://apps.themattharris.com/relmeauth/ )

== Twitter bottleneck ==
itch: [http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2571/3927590515_c3c6be51a9_o.png twitter being down] - bottleneck to update other sites

scratch: implement PubSubHubbub support (easy) + Atom (bulky)
* goal: unbottleneck myself from Twitter
* e.g. updates my Buzz directly

http://www.google.com/profiles/tantek

discovered: 
* Buzz not really support Atom with XHTML (avoiding double-escaping)
* Buzz special treats Twitter - can't emulate yourself (yet)

Maybe Activity Streams can solve this.


== diso ==
itch: DiSo lack of apparent progress, don't want to install/maintain/update WordPress, database backup tax

complexity favors oligarchies, rise of the oligarchies

scratch: [http://tantek.com/2010/034/t2/diso-2-personal-domains-shortener-hatom-push-relmeauth reframe DiSo2] 
* indie web first, oligarchies second

conceptualizing DiSo 2.0: 
# personal site+shortlink domains. 
# algorithmic URL shortener. 
# hAtom store (no DBA tax - easier to maintain/backup than MySQL). 
# hAtom activity stream (DRY). 
# update notifications to PubSubHubbub (PuSH). 
# your own PuSH hub. 
# content-type-specific syndication to specific sites (e.g. text notes to Twitter, geo checkins to Foursquare, photos to Flickr, events to Upcoming, etc.). 
# reverse syndication of comments+tags+notes from said specific sites. 
# edit/comment authorization via RelMeAuth (OAuth + rel-me). 
# personal OAuth endpoint.


== summary ==
steps you can take today:
# use your own site as your identity
# publish on your own site: HTML first (XFN, hCard, hAtom), XML next (Atom, ActivityStreams), API last
# syndicate with PubSubHubbub

Most importantly, build things that scratch your own itches first.
