A '''<dfn>webhook</dfn>''' is a mechanism for notifying a server about updates to some content in realtime by making an HTTP request. Often also referred to as a "callback URL".

Often the payload of a webhook is something small, such as a message that indicates new content for the application or for a specific user, rather than including the actual data itself.
