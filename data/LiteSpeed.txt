'''<dfn>[http://www.litespeedtech.com/ LiteSpeed]</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>LightSpeed</dfn>) [HTTPD] is  [[Apache]] drop-in replacement commercial web server software.

There is a LiteSpeed Open Source Edition called [[OpenLiteSpeed]].
== Issues ==
=== htaccess DefaultType text html causes text plain ===
If you have a directive in your .htaccess like:

<code>DefaultType text/html</code>

LiteSpeed somehow screws up and sends .html files as Content-Type 'text/plain' which makes no sense whatsoever.

The result is that compliant browsers (e.g. Firefox) will render the .html return as plain text source instead of rendering it as HTML.

The workaround is to remove the directive, or comment it out, e.g.:

<code>#DefaultType text/html #commented out due to LiteSpeed bug</code>

And then to test it, be sure to do a <strong><em>Shift</em> command/ctrl-R</strong> to force reload the page.
