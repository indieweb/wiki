[[Tumblr]] allows for creation of sideblogs. They can't post [[likes]] and interact with stuff (it is done from the main blog), but they allow for posting new content and can be used to blog about stuff you wouldn't usually blog about from your main blog. Sideblogs don't require an additional account to be created and are controlled from their creator's main account.
