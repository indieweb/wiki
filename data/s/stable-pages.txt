=Stable pages=

This is a list of pages that are relatively stable, and have only minimal/editorial changes, which makes them much easier to keep in sync with the English versions when doing translations.

This is somewhat priority ordered, so if you are doing a translation, look at translating earlier pages on the list first.

# [[Main_Page]]
# [[principles]]
# [[Getting_Started]]
# [[Contribute]]
# [[why]]
# [[site-deaths]]
# [[internationalization‎]]
# [[other-languages‎]]
# [[how-to-start-new-translation‎]]
# [[site-changes]]
# [[timeline]]
# ...

That's a good start, and if you finish with those, translate the pages that those pages link to.

If you're a translator, as you translate more pages, feel free to add them to the end of the list above.
