A '''<dfn>study</dfn>''' post is a kind of [[post]] that can indicate one or more activities involved in the learning process. 

This page is a highly experimental stub to capture examples and broad thinking about what this sort of post might be or become as well as what types of interactivity between posts might occur between websites (of teachers and students or between students for example). While a variety of other post types like [[read]], [[listen]], and [[watch]] posts may be included or related to study posts, there may be reasons that students, teachers, tutors, and others may want to more specifically track or add mark up to such posts for a variety of potential interactions.

=== Proto examples ===
==== Chris Aldrich ====
* {{chrisaldrich}} has posted a variety of [[read]], [[listen]], [[watch]] and similar related posts on his website so as to indicate the process and progress in learning various topics as part of his "digital garden"/[[commonplace book]]. These posts may often include [[highlight]]s, [[annotations]], or other notes related to these learning activities.
* https://boffosocko.com/2020/09/18/55777124/ - While, technically labeled and marked up as a [[listen]] post, this particular post could be categorized  as study (or learning) post. While primarily focused on a listening activity, it also involved speaking (repeating phrases) and some reading as a multi-activity exercise.
* In the past he has tagged some related coursework with particular topic tags or course specific tags to create [[archive]] pages of activities related to specific classes. Examples include: [https://boffosocko.com/tag/edu522/ edu522] and [https://boffosocko.com/tag/rlst-152/ rlst152] among others. 
* Tangentially related, he also keeps records of [[checkin]]s to particular classes/buildings related to education and coursework: Exaples: https://boffosocko.com/tag/college-math-building/. These might be used by instructors for attendance-based tracking or interactivity.
* Lists of past coursework: https://boffosocko.com/2015/09/22/dr-michael-miller-math-class-hints-and-tips-ucla-extension/#For%20those%20interested
* He's created (some public) posts of his learning related work including posting lectures and notes, which don't always fall easily into a single post kind/type. Example: https://boffosocko.com/2018/09/26/gems-and-astonishments-of-mathematics-past-and-present-lecture-one/
* I've also been using Duolingo as a learning app recently and am curious to log my time and potentially interactions there, but don't have a particular post type (aside from the more free-form [[note]]) to use. Duolingo has functionality that, as a student, I can add a class code to, so that I could potentially indicate my progress to a teacher. Why couldn't something like this be done on my own website and sent to a teacher's site without giving my data to a third party. 

== Silos ==

* Pluralsight
* LinkedIn Learning (aka Lynda.com)
* Udemy
* Coursera
* Khan Academy
* Codecademy
* Udacity

=== Miscellaneous ===
* [https://degreed.com/ Degreed], a platform to "Find, capture, and measure all your learning." 
* [[Duolingo]]
* [[Memrise]]
* [[Anki]]
* [[Mnemonsyne]]
* [[Hypothes.is]] - a highlighting and annotation platform geared toward the academic space and frequently used as a classroom-based tool
* [[Genius]] (fka Rap Genius, aka News Genius, etc) - a highlighting and annotation platform
* [[Diigo]] - for [[bookmark]]s, [[annotations]] and used by many in the education space
* Open Study, a silo-based study platform that closed on 2020-01-31
* [https://brainly.com/ Brainly], a studying/homework help platform 


== Brainstorming ==
* Coronavirus pushing education online heavily makes it more interesting for students and teachers to want to keep more of their resources and works on their own websites for future use, re-use, or review.
* Evidence of learning activities can serve directly as notes for oneself as well as for other students and classmates.
* Evidence of learning might be used for accumulating [[badge]]s or other credentials/degrees.
** {{jgmac1106}} has experimented in the past with sending [[Webmention]] badges to students who show proof of work
* {{chrisaldrich}} has indicated: <blockquote>This particular post also makes me want to have a ‚Äústudy post‚Äù type/kind on my website. I‚Äôve generally not been tracking it directly for things that aren‚Äôt otherwise reading, but it could include writing, listening, speaking, or otherwise working on educational related things that one might want to track: i.e. ‚Äúhow much time did I spend studying subject x?‚Äù</blockquote>
* Audrey Watters has written frequently about the ills of corporations and their platforms targeting and abusing students and their data without necessarily providing value directly to the students
** Examples to come
* This post type might also include activities like active practice (practicing an instrument; compare with [[play]] which has a game and not an instrument connotation), and repetition which one might like to track.
* Perhaps it's just the case that one might use one of the variety of other post types and simply attach a course related tag (subject/topic, course number, other?)
** Terrence Tao's website has examples of this in which he aggregates lectures/notes for particular courses by tag. Course example: https://terrytao.wordpress.com/category/teaching/246a-complex-analysis/; Topic example: https://terrytao.wordpress.com/category/mathematics/mathpr/ for posts about probability theory and stochastic processes
* Some of these posts may indicate progress toward a goal similar to the UI within [[Goodreads]] that tracks progress within a book.
