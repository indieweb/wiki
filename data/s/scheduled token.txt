{{stub}}

'''<dfn>scheduled token</dfn>''' is a [[token]], probably an [[access token]], that is only active between two specific points in time.

== See Also ==

* Use-case: if you are using a 3rd party [[scheduling]] service like [[Futurepub]], you may want to give it a token that only works during when you expect that service to post on your behalf in the future, so you don't have to worry about the service using it too soon, or holding onto it.
