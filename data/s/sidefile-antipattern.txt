The '''<dfn>sidefile-antipattern</dfn>''' is a violation of the [[DRY]] principle by the use of [[sidefiles|secondary files]] (typically in some one-off XML format) to provide information that is a duplicate of information available in primary files on a website (in HTML), and is an antipattern due to typical [[DRY]] violation problems such as out-of-date, missing, corrupted, or outright false data.
