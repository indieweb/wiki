{{stub}}

'''<dfn>self hosting</dfn>''' is the practice of running the software for your personal website on hardware under your own physical control, typically on a server at home, or sometimes refers to only the aspect of running web applications on a server under your control but not necessarily in your home.

The IndieWeb [[principles]] do not make any requirement or even recommendation that this is a good or bad practice. As long as you have your own [[domain]] and can [[export]] your data, you can move between hosting companies and locations without needing to tell people who visit your website that anything has changed.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In the broader sense, everyone with a personal website is already an example of self-hosting their web presence, but not necessarily on a server (hardware) in their home.

== Challenges ==
* You have to be your own sysadmin. This means that if the server goes down, you are responsible.
* You have to run your server 24/7 in your home.
** If you are environmentally conscious, it may be difficult to justify having another computer running all the time when you could use a shared hosting service that is already live.
* You have to open up network ports to run a public web server.
** This makes it difficult to retain your anonymity because your IP address is tied to your location.
** Some ISPs may not provide the functionality necessary to run a web server from home.
