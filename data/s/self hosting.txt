'''<dfn>self hosting</dfn>''' is the practice of running the software for your personal website on hardware under your own physical control, typically on a server at home.

The IndieWeb [[principles]] do not make any requirement or even recommendation that this is a good or bad practice. As long as you have your own [[domain]] and can [[export]] your data, you can move between hosting companies and locations without needing to tell people who visit your website that anything has changed.
