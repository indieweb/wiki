{{stub}}

<dfn>'''sealioning'''</dfn> is a term for intrusive attempts to engage someone with questions and requests for evidence for their claims; don’t do this, especially on the IndieWeb, and consider how you can design [[create]] UX to disincentivize/reduce incentives to do so.

The questioner is typically unknown to the person and only gets involved by way of a hashtag or search term. The term originated from the Wondermark comic “The Terrible Sea Lion”[http://wondermark.com/1k62/] in response to GamerGate tactics.

I'm here to exhaust u so I can stop progress & maintain the status quo, which serves me.
