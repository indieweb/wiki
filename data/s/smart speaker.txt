* Issue: 2023 go reset all your Amazon smart speaker things and the accounts that access them: https://sackheads.social/@Cloudguy/110256209708866473
** "For those who trust me:Goto your Amazon account, sign out of all your devices, everything, everywhere all your Echos (yes I know it's a pain), reset your password, delete 2FA and any tokens and reset them. Now.That doesn't include Fido / Yubikeys but does include Auth tokens.Do it now.As much a pain as it is to reset Echo and all smart devices, trust me, please do it.I can't tell you more yet, but I am being ethical and you need to actually realise I have a clue.It's been a scary day" [https://sackheads.social/@Cloudguy @Cloudguy] April 24, 2023

** "To be very clear.As a journalist I like to ensure that anyone from a news outlet states the facts as best they are able. Or a puff piece is exactly that.At no point have anyone's credentials, or security from an authentication perspective been at risk. Period. I have been very very clear on this from minute one. Echo devices and Alexa devices as I have very very clearly said are not at risk, a vector, an issue or a threat.The issues at hand are being dealt with by Amazon admirably."
