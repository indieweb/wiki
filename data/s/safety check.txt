'''<dfn>safety check</dfn>''' is an aggregation feature that shows a list of the people you follow in a disaster affected geographical area that have marked themselves as safe; like [[Facebook]] does at https://www.facebook.com/safetycheck.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has a Safety Check page:
* https://www.facebook.com/safetycheck
which redirects to a subpage of that URL of the most recent disaster worldwide that Facebook is tracking and aggregating safety information for.
