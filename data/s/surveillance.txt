== Brainstorming ==
=== Minimize data collection ===
IndieWeb sites and services should seek to collect and hold a minimum (if any at all) data about visitors and users. The less data that is kept, the less you have to be responsible for, or could be intercepted or otherwise accessed by others for surveillance purposes.
