{{stub}}

'''<dfn>singleton</dfn>''' is in the context of the indieweb, or decentralized web in general, a shared (effectively centralized) data structure (like a [[blockchain]] ledger) or database (like the consequence of assuming a specific hashing algorithm) being used by (and thus a limitation of) an otherwise seemingly distributed system.
