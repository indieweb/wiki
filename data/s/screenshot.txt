A <dfn>screenshot</dfn> is an image of a computer screen or a website.

Website screenshots can be shown with [[bookmark]]s in the [[reply-context]] or as a [[photo]].

Screenshots can also be displayed in image meta tags, allowing people to see a preview of one of your web pages before they open the link.
