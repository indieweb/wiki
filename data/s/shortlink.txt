{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>shortlink</dfn>''' is the use of a [[short-domain]] to create (usually with a third party [[link shortener]] service) a link that redirects to (often much) longer link, popularized on [[Twitter]], and a subset of which are first-party [[permashortlinks]] for indieweb [[POSSE]]ing and other use-cases.

== Use cases ==
See: [[URL design]], especially:
* '''[[URL_design#Avoid|URL design: Avoid long links]]''' for reasons to use shortlinks, especially when posting places other than your own site.

== Service Examples ==
=== Bitly ===
bit.ly is a third party link shortening service that has been around for a while (since when?)
* for a long time you could use "j.mp" for bit.ly paths to shorten the link even shorter by two characters, and avoid using the restrictive [[.ly]] ccTLD.

=== See Others ===
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening#Notable_services for a longer list that does not need to be replicated here (unless there is some IndieWeb-specific use or criticism).

== Silo Examples ==
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] has a first-party only short domain at:
* https://flic.kr/
that appears to redirect any non-empty paths to <samp>www.flickr.com</samp>

=== YouTube ===
[[YouTube]] has a first-party (only?) short domain at:
* https://youtu.be/

== Criticism ==
=== Worsens link fragility ===
Third party shortlinks (especially those that store the actual URL in a database and use an opaque identifier instead) have a reputation for fragility, and periodically result in a massive number of links breaking on various services that use them.

E.g. defunct 3rd party short-link services:
* [[tr.im]]
* [[twtmore]]
* [[wl.gs]]
