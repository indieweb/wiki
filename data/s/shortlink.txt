{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>shortlink</dfn>''' is the use of a [[short-domain]] to create a link that redirects to (often much) longer link, popularized on [[Twitter]], and used in [[permashortlinks]] for indieweb [[POSSE]]ing..

== Use cases ==
See: [[URL design]], especially:
* '''[[URL_design#Avoid|URL design: Avoid long links]]''' for reasons to use shortlinks, especially when posting places other than your own site.

== Criticism ==
=== Worsens link fragility ===
Third party shortlinks (especially those that store the actual URL in a database and use an opaque identifier instead) have a reputation for fragility, and periodically result in a massive number of links breaking on various services that use them.

E.g.
* [[twtmore]]
* [[wl.gs]]
