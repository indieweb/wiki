{{stub}}

In [[OAuth]] terminology, '''<dfn>scope</dfn>''' is a way to limit what parts of your account are accessible by third-party applications.

For example, you can choose to allow one application to read your basic profile info, while another application may be authorized to post on your behalf. 

== Micropub Scopes ==

[[Micropub]] clients use scopes to indicate what permissions they are requesting from Micropub servers, which will result in the user seeing the listed scopes in the authorization prompt. Clients and servers must agree on the names and expected behavior of a list of scopes in order to provide a consistent user experience among apps.

Listed below are the currently supported Micropub scopes across most clients and servers.

* '''<code id="create">create</code>''' - allows the client to create posts on behalf of the user
* '''<code id="draft">draft</code>''' - ([https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/24 proposed]) allows the client to create draft posts only on behalf of the user (requested in lieu of create scope)
* '''<code id="update">update</code>''' - allows the client to edit existing posts
* '''<code id="delete">delete</code>''' - allows the client to delete posts
* '''<code id="media">media</code>''' - allows the client to upload files to the [[media endpoint]]

These are distinct permissions, so e.g. granting a client only "create" scope means it will not be able to update or delete existing posts.

Most servers allow clients with the <code>create</code> scope to also allow uploading to the media endpoint. The <code>media</code> scope can be used to allow clients to only upload to the media endpoint without being able to also create posts.

Use the sections below to document additional experimental scopes that software has implemented, and once there are two or more clients and servers that support the additional scopes, they can be added to the registry above.

=== Scopes supported by Micropub clients ===
[[File:quill scope selection.png|thumb|right]]
* [[Quill]] requests the "create" and/or "update" scope when authorizing it to create posts on your domain.
* [[OwnYourGram]] requests the "create" scope when authorizing it to create photo posts on your domain.
* [[Micropublish.net]] requests the scopes "post" or "create update delete undelete", for the user to choose, and has the option to select "draft" scope
* [[Indigenous]] requests the "create", "update" and "delete" scopes when logging in to the app.
* [[indiebookclub]] requests the "create" scope.
* [[Indiepaper]] requests the "create", "update", and "save" scopes when logging in.
* [[Micro.blog]] requests the "create" scope.
* [[Sunlit]] requests the "create" scope.
* www-editor.jvt.me requests the "create update delete undelete" scopes

=== Scopes supported by Micropub servers ===
[[File:aaronpk auth form.png|thumb|right]]
* Known supports _____
* The Wordpress Micropub plugin uses WordPress capabilities and those capabilities are edited based on scope by the WordPress IndieAuth plugin. 
** The create, draft, update, delete, and media scopes are supported. The profile scope is listed but currently is not implemented as a capability.
* {{aaronpk}} requires the "create" scope in order for a client to create new posts, "update" for updates, and "delete" for deletes. "media" for file uploads. if the client is issued a token that contains the "draft" scope, that client can ''only'' create draft posts.
* {{voxpelli}}, using his [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github micropub-to-github] endpoint, requires the "create" or "post" scope for a client to give access, treating "create" as the preferred one
* {{sebsel}} uses scopes "create", "update", "delete", "media" (for photo upload) and "media-plus" (for uploads without limitations on file extension)
* {{jamietanna}} uses "create", "update", "delete", "media" (for photo upload), and "undelete" (to undelete posts, or to view deleted posts via `q=source`)
** Jamie is also planning on adding the "notify" scope to allow for sending push notifications

== Microsub Scopes ==
[[Microsub]] clients use scopes to indicate what actions they are requesting to be able to take on the user's account.

* <code id="read">read</code> - this is the minimum scope clients should request. this allows clients to have read access to channels.
* <code id="follow">follow</code> - allows the client to manage the following list
* <code id="mute">mute</code> - allows the client to mute and unmute users
* <code id="block">block</code> - allows the client to block and unblock users
* <code id="channels">channels</code> - allows the client to manage channels

== IndieAuth Scopes ==

=== Profile Data ===

To request profile information of a client, such as the user's name and profile photo over just a URL, particularly for IndieAuth clients/servers which may not support Microformats2 parsing for profile information, there is the https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#profile-information functionality, which uses the profile scope, and additional properties that can be added to mirror OpenID Connect.

* '''<code id="profile">profile</code>''' - provide basic profile data. Sites can optionally require this for all profile data, or provide some profile data in all returns.
* '''<code id="email">email</code>''' - request email address


=== Brainstorming ===

==== Other Scopes ====

* '''<code id="undelete">undelete</code>''' - allows the client to undelete a deleted post, if possible
* '''<code id="notify">notify</code>''' - allows the client to send push notifications to the user

=== Scoped by Post Types ====

As of 2022-03-28, the Micropub spec [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#scope suggests suffixing certain scopes with post types] to restrict the kind of action that can be made. For example:

* <code>create:note</code> - restricts a token to only create new [[note|notes]]
* <code>update:read</code> - only updating existing [[read|read-of]] posts

==== Servers ====

* {{jacky}}'s [[Koype]] has tickets tracking this behavior
** https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/25
** https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/23

== Scopes used by Silos ==
=== [[GitHub]] ===
Github has defined many scopes for granting very granular permissions to applications. By default, applications can only read public profile info unless granted explicit scopes. Write access to any parts of a user account must be explicitly authorized with one or more scopes such as "user", "repo", or "gist". Deleting repos requires a specialized scope as well.

See the [https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes full list of Github OAuth scopes].

===[[Google+]]===

<blockquote>
Scopes that conform to the OpenID Connect standard have full names that are short: profile, email and openid—they are not in the form of a URI. On the other hand, Google-specific scopes are in the form of a URI, such as https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login
