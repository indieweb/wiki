{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>shebang</dfn>''' (or '''hashbang''') is the character sequence <code>#!</code>. In web development, it has been used in URLs to make [[AJAX]] content searchable by giving it a pseudo-URL. This is problematic because it relies on [[javascript]] to retrieve the content and can easily break.

<blockquote>…it most definitely _is_ about the hashbangs. This technique, on its own, is destructive to the web. The implementation is inappropriate, even as a temporary measure or as a downgrade experience.</blockquote>

* Twitter broke their own hashbang links, e.g. https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23microformats used to give # microformats hashtag results but now just redirects to their "explore" page.

* to-do: expand dfn to be IndieWeb-relevant (e.g. better development practices), perhaps add to [[antipatterns]], incorporate "See Also" items into main article content
