'''<dfn>streaming</dfn>''' is a method of content delivery where the user starts viewing a post on a site, typically timed media, and when it finishes, the site may automatically start showing another, either by scrolling or playing.

=== Indieflix ===
Inspired by [http://tantek.com/2016/069/t1/netflix-down-brainstorm-indieweb-flix Netflix’s outage], brainstorming about what would an “Indieflix” look like, and how would it work.

An Indieflix viewer could start focus on indie content to start with, seed it with [[video#IndieWeb_Examples]] and then discover more via [[h-review]]s of videos posted by those users. Then you can say, since you liked this video, watch what they liked, etc.
