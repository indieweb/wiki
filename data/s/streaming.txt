'''<dfn>streaming</dfn>''' is a method of content delivery where the user starts viewing a post on a site, typically timed media, and when it finishes, the site may automatically start showing another, either by scrolling or playing. [[live streaming|Live streaming]] is a special case, where media is streamed as it is created.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Netflix]] - streaming [[video]]
* [[Spotify]] - streaming [[audio]]
* [[YouTube]] - in particular at https://www.youtube.com/tv
* Twitch does live [[video]] streaming

== Brainstorming ==
=== Indieflix ===
Inspired by [http://tantek.com/2016/069/t1/netflix-down-brainstorm-indieweb-flix Netflix’s outage], brainstorming about what would an “Indieflix” look like, and how would it work.

An Indieflix viewer could start focus on indie content to start with, seed it with [[video#IndieWeb_Examples]] and then discover more via [[h-review]]s of videos posted by those users. Then you can say, since you liked this video, watch what they liked, etc.


=== PeerTube ===

=== LaraTube ===
An open-source Laravel PHP project as part of a course on Udemy. [https://github.com/jamalapriadi/laratube/blob/master/app/Jobs/Videos/ConvertForStreaming.php A reasonable GitHub implementation] [https://www.udemy.com/course/youtube-clone/ Udemy course]

* Uses FFMPEG
* Uses PHP
* Uses Laravel
* Works with standard web-servers without additions
* Not IndieWeb centric (could be after some tweaks)

> it’s a bit alarming how pretty much every time someone asks about setting up one’s own streaming server the answer is always “just use ffmpeg” but then the followup question of “okay, how?” never gets answered. via [https://indieweb.org/User:Beesbuzz.biz Fluffy]

=== Problems ===
