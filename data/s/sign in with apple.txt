'''<dfn>Sign In with Apple</dfn>''' is an authorization api similar to social silo login buttons that allows a user to sign in using their Apple device. Personal websites could allow this as a more secure sign in when IndieAuth is not available but social silos are not preferred.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* No IndieWeb examples currently.

== Brainstorming ==
* {{eddiehinkle}} is investigating using sign in with Apple on his website as an alternative for friends and family that don't have IndieAuth.


== Notes ==
