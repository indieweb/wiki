{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>soft quit</dfn>''' of a [[silo]] is when a person temporarily leaves, deactivates, or takes an extended break from one or more social media platforms for any of a wide variety of reasons. Sometimes referred to as taking a "social media break". Compare with [[silo-quits]] which have a more permanent connotation. 

== Why ==
People performing soft quits may fall short of permanently deactivating or deleting their accounts as they represent the only means of contact with other people or groups they want to stay in touch with. Some may use workarounds to mitigate problems or issues they have with the platform while still minimally participating to get the information and contact they desire.

Many soft quitters aren't aware of other potential methods of communication or may be discouraged by the user interfaces and experiences they may find via other modalities.

=== Possible reasons for soft quits ===
* mental health
** Social media silos have been shown to cause depression, obsession, anxiety, and other mental heath problems [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/study-using-facebook-makes-you-feel-depressed.html] [https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/05/18/how-heavy-use-of-social-media-is-linked-to-mental-illness]

* [https://adamcroom.com/2019/04/dumb-twitter/ 2018-11] [https://adamcroom.com/ Adam Croom], a [[A_Domain_of_One%27s_Own|Domain of One's Own]] advocate, did a "soft quit" of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
<blockquote>I decided that I would deactivate my Twitter account for the holidays. The holidays turned quickly turned into six months and here I am. I still have access to the Twitter profiles I wish to follow as most profiles are public, and thus I make a conscience effort to check the streams of particular folks (mostly journalists and news publications) that Iâ€™m still interested in following. Unsurprisingly, removing myself from punching the Twitter icon and swimming in the often negative environment that the community perpetuates has been a net positive for my health. In a similar fashion, I donâ€™t have Instagram installed on my phone anymore (my workaround here is Iâ€™ll occasionally install it and bulk upload a handful of files and then delete it). For Facebook, I actually inactivated that account in November as well, but surprisingly felt myself come back to it quicker for important information I would miss otherwise (my gym uses a private group for all communication). But, for the most part, my day is spent sans social media.</blockquote>


== Counter Examples ==
There are also people who may "soft join" a platform for either a minimal set of functionalities or specific connections with people.

=== Robin Sloan ===
[https://www.robinsloan.com/ Robin Sloan] joined [[micro.blog]] for the express purpose of interacting with one friend as stated in his first post: 
<blockquote>Literally just here to follow @ayjay ðŸ‘‹<br/>
&mdash;[https://robinsloan.micro.blog/2018/08/18/literally-just-here.html Robin Sloan] 2018-08-18</blockquote>
All his subsequent interactions on the platform (as of 2019-05-06) were solely replies or interactions meant for one user despite some incoming interactions with other users.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Naming ===
None of the citations or quotes actually use the phrase "soft quit" which makes it unmemorable to associate with new examples. In reading the examples, few of them have a "quit" intention, more of them mention other phrases.

We should rename this page accordingly to use one of these terms:
* deactivate
* break - LOTS of examples use this literal term, see [[silo-quits]] for "social media break" or "break from"
** {{chrisaldrich}} +1 to this or "social media break" (the original name "soft quit" was to have something and to keep a reasonable parallelism with [[silo-quits]], see also [[naming]])
* pause (e.g. silo pause)
* ...

In some variant like:
* silo break
* social media break
* ...

** "Hello friends!!!<br>After two weeks off of posting, Iâ€™m back! I generally think of Instagram as a positive tool for human connection. But a few weeks ago I noticed a shift in my IG intentions when my hashtags were banned and I was losing following. I started to get really upset and then I asked myself a hard question, is this constant feeling of needing to create serving me or hurting me? When it starts to feel like itâ€™s bringing more negativity than joy, I know itâ€™s not sustainable.<br>A few weeks off and I feel 100% better. Instagram is only a small fraction of my life, but Iâ€™ll always do the work to make sure my habits here are healthy. Thank you for bearing with me. Iâ€™m here for you all. I love you!"
