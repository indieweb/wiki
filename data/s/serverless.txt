{{stub}}

'''<dfn>serverless</dfn>''' is a doublethink term that misleadingly refers to web applications that completely depend on someone elseâ€™s servers (rather than <em>no servers</em> as a literal interpretation would imply), often through proprietary function as a service (FaaS) services, like [[AWS_Lambda]], which have been used for experimental IndieWeb [[building blocks]] implementations.

There are definitions of {{scarequote|serverless}} that also include backend as a service (BaaS) services, e.g. [https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html Serverless Architectures].

IndieWeb members [[AWS_Lambda#Brainstorming|have experimented with]] {{scarequote|serverless}} services for various [[building blocks]] such as Micropub endpoints.

== Criticism ==
=== Lock-in ===
Due to use on proprietary FaaS/BaaS, typical {{scarequote|serverless}} implementations suffer from a lock-in effect, from code that depends on those proprietary APIs, data formats etc.
