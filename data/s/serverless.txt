{{stub}}

<div class="p-summary">'''<dfn>serverless</dfn>''' is a misnomer, as servers are still actually used. It generally uses platform specific structure to allow the end-user to not concern themselves with the underlying architecture while introducing other complexities such as lock-in. Serverless platforms are occasionally used by IndieWeb members for various building blocks such as Micropub endpoints.</div>
