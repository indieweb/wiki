A '''<dfn>social graph</dfn>''' is a network of social profiles/identities and relationships between them, either on a single site like a [[silo]], across the web, or in-person connections. The phrase was popularized by Google's now defunct Social Graph API.

== Variations ==
=== Identity Graph===
A subset of the full social graph that only focuses on the relationships between different representations of the same single [[identity]] and ignores the social relations between multiple such identities. Makes the scope of crawling the entire graph much more manageable.

== Implementations ==
=== Google Social Graph API ===
The now defunct [https://developers.google.com/social-graph/ Social Graph API] indexed [[XFN]] and [[FOAF]] data and provided a free and open REST API where people could query it. Also contained a [https://code.google.com/p/google-sgnodemapper/ Social Graph Node Mapper] that created canonical identities for [[silo]] identities using the '''sgn://''' protocol
=== identengine ===
See [[identengine]]. Focused on the ''identity graph'' subset of the social graph.
=== RelSpider ===
[[relspider]] â€“ a project by {{Template:voxpelli}} that crawls identities using [[rel-me]] links. Focused on the ''identity graph'' subset of the social graph and to enable similar questions for that subset as the Google Social Graph once did. Started out as an experiment at [[Flattr]] to resolve [[verified]] ownership of web pages in an open, non-hands on way.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
Facebook focuses heavily on their internal social graph, which eg. shines through in the name of their [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api Graph API].
