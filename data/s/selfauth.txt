{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://github.com/inklings-io/selfauth selfauth]</dfn>''' is a single user authorization endpoint written as single-file [[PHP]] without a database.

If you are looking for a minimal, self-hostable [[token endpoint]], see [[Mintoken]].

== Why ==

* You don't need [[silo]] accounts to use Selfauth, so it's [[IndieAuth]] without Twitter or Github.
* More privacy: you don't tell silos that you want to login somewhere, only your own server.
* Not vulnerable for social engineering with silo accounts.

== How-to ==

# Download the latest version of selfauth from GitHub: https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth/archive/master.zip.
# Upload <code>index.php</code> and <code>setup.php</code> to any public folder on your website. The rest of this how to assumes a folder called <code>auth</code> in the root of your website, reachable on <code><raw>https://example.com/auth/</raw></code>.
# Navigate to <code>setup.php</code> in your browser, e.g. <code><raw>https://example.com/auth/setup.php</raw></code> and follow the steps on screen.
#* It will ask you to provide the URL you want to login with, probably your homepage, and
#* a password to identify yourself with.
# Add a link to your homepage so websites you are logging in to can find it. Do this by adding the following to your <code><head></code>, don’t forget to change the <code>href</code> to link to where you uploaded the files! <pre><link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://example.com/auth/" /></pre>

You are done and can now login to any [[IndieAuth]] supporting website with nothing other than your own site!

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Martijn van der Ven ===

{{martijnvdven}} has been using selfauth to login to [[Telegraph]] and this wiki as of 2017-06-23. Important part of his [[selfdogfood]] principle.

== Criticism ==

* It's easier to use rel=me and re-use your existing accounts, with all it's security features.
** However, this criticism is only applicable when using selfauth for authenticating to sites. When authorizing an app such as a [[Micropub]] app to let it post to your site, some other software needs to run in order for that to happen: either a self-hosted token endpoint or a service such as [[IndieAuth.com]].
