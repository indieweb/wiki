'''<dfn>suggested post</dfn>''' is a feature of [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], and likely other silos where a post from someone you are not otherwise following is inserted in a reading stream (like your logged-in silo home page or screen), [[suggested]] by their [[recommendation engine]] as something you might appreciate seeing and engage with.
