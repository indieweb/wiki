'''<dfn>snark</dfn>''' is an experimental post type to denote a [[sarcastic]] post.

"[@OhMeadhbh] when i build my own twitter replacement, it's going to have a "snark" check-box so you can denote when you're being snarky."

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
* {{benthatmustbeme}} posts snarks with [[Postly]] which appear with an automatic "Sarcasm Alert" message https://ben.thatmustbe.me/snark/2015/7/18/3/

== See Also ==
* [[sarcasm]]
* Brainstorming: format with an explicit in-content </sarcasm> closing tag, e.g. https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2003Jan/0292.html
