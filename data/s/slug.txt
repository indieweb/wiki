{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>slug</dfn>''' is a series of words in a [[permalink]] URL, usually at the end, that are from or representative of the name or text of a post, and thus part of an overall [[URL design]]. Slugs are often automatically generated based on the post name, replacing whitespace with hyphens and accented characters with English alphabet characters, sometimes edited by the author.

** "capjamesg: one of my thoughts that's been in the back of my mind for a while is to automatically generate a slug for my posts. Right now, I've been finding myself manually choosing slugs that are 1-2 words, based on the most significant words in the post" [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] June 2, 2023

** "i think my rough heuristic is: use a hashtag for the post if there's a hashtag in the text. then use the most unique proper noun." [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] June 2, 2023

** "i've been thinking about this for a while, because basically every time i post something, i choose a slug for it, so i've been paying attention to my own rules I use for finding a slug that I want for the post" [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] June 2, 2023
* Pro-tip: Don't end a slug with a preposition, otherwise you may get something like https://lostinhaste.com/2024/02/25/the-perils-of.html which reads like ‚ÄúThe Perils of HTML‚Äù which it absolutely is not about.
