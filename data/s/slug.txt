{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>slug</dfn>''' is a series of words in a [[permalink]] URL, usually at the end, that are from or representative of the name or text of a post, and thus part of an overall [[URL design]]. Slugs are often automatically generated based on the post name, replacing spaces with hyphens and accented characters with English alphabet characters, sometimes edited by the author.

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
You should use good slugs in your permalinks because URLs are [https://www.hanselman.com/blog/urls-are-ui part of the user interface] ([[UI]]).

As long as people share URLs in plain text communications (which is likely forever), URLs are a part of the language people read, and thus adding relevant or key words to a permalink helps the reader decide whether a link is worth viewing or not.

See: [[URL_design#Topic]] for now

This section can/should be expanded with immediately inline how to tips, perhaps with ideas from [[URL_design#Topic]].

=== How not to ===
* Don't end a slug with a preposition, adjective, or possessive. Doing so may result something like:
** https://lostinhaste.com/2024/02/25/the-perils-of.html which reads like '''The Perils of HTML''' which it absolutely is not about

** "capjamesg: one of my thoughts that's been in the back of my mind for a while is to automatically generate a slug for my posts. Right now, I've been finding myself manually choosing slugs that are 1-2 words, based on the most significant words in the post" [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] June 2, 2023

** "i think my rough heuristic is: use a hashtag for the post if there's a hashtag in the text. then use the most unique proper noun." [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] June 2, 2023

** "i've been thinking about this for a while, because basically every time i post something, i choose a slug for it, so i've been paying attention to my own rules I use for finding a slug that I want for the post" [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] June 2, 2023
