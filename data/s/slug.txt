{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>slug</dfn>''' is a series of words in a [[permalink]] URL, usually at the end, that are from or representative of the name or text of a post, and thus part of an overall [[URL design]]. Slugs are often automatically generated based on the post name, replacing whitespace with hyphens and accented characters with English alphabet characters, sometimes edited by the author.
