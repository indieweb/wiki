{{stub}}

'''<dfn>self-hosted</dfn>''' is the idea of running web applications such as your [[homepage|personal website]] on servers under your control, either locally/directly owned (such as on a computer at home) or rented-but-replaceable (such as a rented [[VPS]]).

== IndieWeb Examples ==

Everyone with a personal website is already an example of self-hosting their web presence!
