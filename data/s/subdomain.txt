{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>subdomain</dfn>''' typically refers to a [[domain]] with one more "name(dot)" component than that which someone actually has registered which is often seen indieweb sites with a family name domain like joel(dot)franusic(dot)com, or often on [[silos]] like matt(dot)wordpress(dot)com.

Most writing about IndieWeb assumes people will have their own second-level domain, like tantek.com, used just for themselves.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Joel Franusic ===
[[User:joel.example.com|Joel Franusic]] uses joel.franusic.com as a way to separate given and family names, thus allowing for other subdomains for other Franusic family members.

=== Ben Roberts ===
[[User:ben.thatmustbe.me|Ben Roberts]] uses ben.thatmustbe.me - likely as a "domain hack" that reads as an English sentence.

=== David Shanske ===
[[User:david.shanske.com|David Shanske]] uses david.shanske.com as a way to separate given and family names.

=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{martijnvdven}} used martijn.vanderven.se for a while but went back to using [[#Path_alternative|a path]]. Other family members are still on subdomains.

=== Lewis Cowles ===
{{LCowles}} has many non-canonical websites linking to their domain using the canonical representation tag to denote their primary, and legacy domain. lewis.cowles.uk is their attempt to have a longer-term and perhaps more accurate representation of their current nation, family name and their own name, separated as a subdomain from their family domain.

== Silo Examples ==
The following silos give users subdomains:
* [[Blogger]]
* [[Known]]
* [[LiveJournal]] (switched from path to subdomain in 2006, read why: [[lj2006]]
* [[Tumblr]]
* [[WordPress]]

The following silos used to use subdomains but switched away:
* [[Slack]] used to use a per-team/community subdomain but, in 2019, switched to hosting everything under a single multi-tenant <code>app.slack.com</code> endpoint.
: This was for multiple reasons, the largest/most publicized one being for some of their [https://slackhq.com/introducing-a-more-efficient-slack-desktop-experience performance improvements] (since now multiple "teams" can share resources and a JS interpreter/Electron context/etc. for a single user on multiple teams). This also has some positive privacy side-effects:
:* Monitored networks can no longer trivially see which Slack communities someone is connected to (via packet inspection), since all identifying components of URIs are behind a TLS session
:* A network can't firewall off specific communities without removing access to all of Slack

== Service Examples ==
Services that use or used subdomains and have switched to using paths instead or vice-versa.
=== Former service subdomain examples ===
In 2022, [[Google]] switched their Maps service from using a subdomain to using a path:
* 2022-11-24 [https://garrit.xyz/posts/2022-11-24-smart-move-google Smart Move, Google] <blockquote>â€¦ maps.google.com now redirects to google.com/maps. This implies that the permissions I give to Google Maps now apply to all of Googles services hosted under this domain</blockquote>

== Subdomain advantages disadvantages ==
Pros: 

* reduced cost and admin effort
* each subdomain can be hosted at a different provider, allowing more flexibility for each person on the domain

Cons: 

* In a hypothetical example of alice.example.com, alice is dependent on example.com, although the dependency can potentially be very small, with example.com just managing a [[DNS]] "A" record for alice, pointing to alice's server.

== Path alternative ==
Example: <nowiki>http://example.com/alice instead of http://alice.example.com/</nowiki>

If you use a URL with a path as your identity, your identity is vulnerable to the owner of the domain, and that any other site/path at that domain has [[CORS]] access to your identity.

If you are the owner of the domain, you should just use it directly without a path.

If you cannot or do not want to use just your domain, consider a [[subdomain]] instead of a path.

Path alternative advocates claim:
* Advantage of path alternative: reduced cost and admin effort

However there is no escaping the downsides of path based identity:
* Disadvantage: alice is locked into example.com; there's no way alice can leave.
* Disadvantage: example.com can't allow alice to host arbitrary content without endangering their other users, because of the browser same-origin policy.

=== Indieweb Path Examples ===
* [[Known]] multi-user sites provide paths instead of subdomains, because the configuration challenge for users to set up wildcard subdomains on shared hosts is too great. This is one challenge associated with [[web hosting#Shared_Hosting|shared hosting]].
* {{martijnvdven}} has his identity at <raw>https://vanderven.se<b>/martijn/</b></raw>.

=== Silo Path Examples ===
The following silos give paths to users instead of subdomains:
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Twitter]]

=== Other Path Examples ===
The following other sites use paths instead of subdomains:
* [[Google Maps]] uses (since 2016-11-??) <samp>www.google.com/maps</samp> instead of <samp>maps.google.com</samp> which it used from launch 2015-02-08 until 2016-10-??, and which now redirects to <samp>www.google.com/maps</samp>.
* ...

=== Former Silo Path Examples ===
The following silos used to use paths for identity, and explicitly switched to using subdomains:
* [[LiveJournal]] - see [[lj2006]] for Livejournal's having to deal with this in 2006.

== Conclusion ==
It seems okay to use subdomains for personal profiles as long as the 2nd-level domain holder makes a sufficient guarantee of subdomain portability.  That is, they must let users change their DNS "A" records in perpetuity for no more than a minimal charge.

This seems reasonable with families, and perhaps also with fraternities, colleges, and other organizations to which one naturally has a life-long membership.

At some point, there may be companies willing to offer this kind of service with a plausible very-long-term commitment.

Note that taking advantage of free hosting that offers free subdomains leaves a lot of control of the domain in the hands of the host, putting your url at [http://indiewebcamp.com/why#Why_Indie_Web risk of a whole lot of things].   Similarly, universities, etc, tend to not provide long-term stability.

== Avoid www subdomain ==
Avoid using "www." on your domain.
* It introduces an unnecessary security scoping (see above)

== See Also ==
* [[dns]]
* [[personal domain]]
* [[short domain]]
* http://no-www.org/
* [[Medium]] uses username.medium.com for some users and redirects from /@username to the subdomain
