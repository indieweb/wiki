'''<dfn><code>size</code></dfn>''' is an emerging [[microformats2]] property that indicates the size in bytes of an [[audio]] and/or [[video]] file in the same item, eg a [[podcast]].


== How to ==
=== How to publish ===

Use a <code>data</code> element with the exact integer number of bytes in the <code>value</code> attribute, and any human-readable representation you choose in the contents. Example:

<pre>
<data class="p-size" value="45678">45.7 KB</data>
</pre>

[[podcast#Brainstorming|Some examples in the wild]] only include human-readable string approximations, eg <code>17.43mb</code> and <code>62.2 MB</code>, but these can't be used in places that need the exact number of bytes, eg RSS enclosures.

[[granary]] converts podcast h-feeds and h-entries to RSS with enclosures, including iTunes extension elements.

It reads episode size from the <code>size</code> mf2 properties, and supports both integer bytes and human-readable string approximations. It emits a <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tag with both integer bytes and human-readable approximation, as described above. [https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/169 Background discussion].
