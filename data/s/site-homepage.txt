'''<dfn>site-homepage</dfn>''' is an ongoing project to iteratively improve the IndieWeb.org site homepage to make it more responsive, and more accessible & useful to more [[generations]]. Current specific project:
* '''[[2019/homepage]]'''
* '''[[2021/homepage]]'''

See '''[[homepage]]''' for general personal homepage discussion efforts.
__TOC__
== Brainstorming ==
=== New live modules ===
New live modules which could be used to improve the apparent freshness / usefulness of the homepage (in no particular order, feel free to mention which ones you might like more).
* [https://github.com/indieweb/wiki/issues/41 Github issue 41: consider adding live update modules to homepage e.g. like newsletter sections]

Many inspired by the [[this-week]] newsletter and https://enwp.org/ homepage
* '''Featured Article''' ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#mp-tfa-h2 like Wikipedia’s "From today's featured article"]) — an article (page on our wiki) that we display more prominently, and perhaps near the top of the [[this-week-in-the-indieweb]] newsletter
** it could be a new page (that week) or a highly edited recent page (per the newsletter)
** looks like Wikipedia is grabbing the "primary" image and first two paragraphs of a wiki page to summarize as the "featured article"
** apparently the Wikipedia featured article image becomes the featured photo for the entire Wikipedia home page!
*** e.g. on 2022-11-18 when their featured article was "I Drink Wine" (a song by Adele), a Wikipedia home page link, when pasted in Slack, displayed a [[link-preview]] of <blockquote>(favicon) "Wikipedia"<br/>"Main Page (308 kB)"<br/>(a giant image of Adele)</blockquote>
* '''[[on this day]]''' ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#mp-otd-h2 like on Wikipedia]) - include events from [[timeline]] first, [[history]] second (could automate if those were marked up with h-event?), and maybe later allow overriding with custom pages for each day of the year?
** most notable three things in linked sentence form (like on WP)
** list of 6 next things (timeline, then history)
** site births/deaths.
* '''Recent [[events]]''' - in particular photos from four most recent events (with photos) in the past 7-14 days. Link photos to events.
* '''Upcoming [[events]]''' - replace [[Sidebar]] (manual updates) and [[Main_Page#Homebrew_Website_Club]] & IWCs section below it by some sort of automated box maybe listing events for the next two weeks, and a calendar with days highlighted with IndieWeb related events
** [[Kaja]] right now generates the section listing upcoming HWCs, parsing [[Events]] for the data (written to [[User:Kaja.sknebel.net/upcoming-hwcs]], which is transcluded on the main page)
* '''New Community Members''' (inspired by [[this-week]], e.g. [https://indieweb.org/this-week/2017-09-01.html#new-community-members from 2017-09-01])
* '''In the news''' (like [[Wikipedia]]) - recent [[posts about]]
* '''Recent [[podcasts about]]'''
** Maybe automate most recent "This Week in the IndieWeb" audio edition linking at least
* '''New wiki pages''' (e.g. 10 most recently created)
* '''Recently active pages''' (e.g. 10 most edited pages in the recent past week? 2 weeks? month?)
* '''IndieWeb News summary''' a list of some recent posts from [https://news.indieweb.org IndieWeb News]
* ... feel free to add more! Perhaps more ideas from http://enwp.org/ homepage?

== Past ==
* Some aspects of [[2017/refresh]] session and project
* [[2016/homepage]] session and project
* [[2014/wiki-redesign]]

== See Also ==
* [https://github.com/indieweb/wiki/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahomepage Github issues for the wiki to improve the homepage]
* better spell that out that the IndieWeb is just the normal web (with new conventions to make it more social) (via manton)
* ^^^ note existing homepage already describes some of this in the Beyond Blogging and Decentralization section: https://indieweb.org/#Beyond_Blogging_and_Decentralization - figure out how to improve that section accordingly to incorporate Manton's suggestion
