A '''<dfn>sitemap</dfn>''' is a list of pages on a website.

== Why ==
=== Navigability ===
It can be easier to find the content you're looking for on a sitemap, since they are typically text-heavy pages and do not require navigating through a site which may be loading lots of Javascript or image content.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Zachary Kai ===
https://zacharykai.net/sitemap.xml (XML)

=== Add yourself! ===
{{addyourself}}

=== Past Examples ===
==== Bret Comnes ====
{{bret}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150523114558/http://bret.io/sitemap archived example] (XML)

== Organization Examples ==
Examples of corporate or other organization sites with sitemaps.
* https://www.apple.com/sitemap/
* https://www.ibm.com/sitemap/
* http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sitemap.aspx
* https://www.un.org/en/site-index
* https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/site-map.html

=== Subsites ===
Some sites have subsites, e.g. at subdomains, which have their own sitemaps.

'''Facebook'''
* https://www.facebook.com/business/sitemap/
* https://developers.facebook.com/m/sitemap/

=== Past Examples ===
* Google used to have a sitemap at http://www.google.com/sitemap.html however that now redirects to http://www.google.com/about/products/ which still resembles a sitemap but it's not clear if that's its intent (judging by the renaming)
* The W3C had a sitemap at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/siteindex.html but that page was redirected to the homepage in 2023. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20230702125119/http://www.w3.org/Consortium/siteindex.html archived version])
* Yahoo subsites had their own sitemaps. Note the inconsistent paths.
** Yahoo news had a sitemap at https://my.news.yahoo.com/sitemap/ until 2014 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20141018004017/https://my.news.yahoo.com/sitemap/ archive])
** Yahoo finance had a sitemap at http://finance.yahoo.com/sm until 2017 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160123190304/http://finance.yahoo.com/sm archive])

== Brainstorming ==
=== sitemap microformat ===
See http://microformats.org/wiki/sitemap for the effort to develop a sitemap microformat to markup visible sitemap pages for semantic crawling and indexing, eliminating any need for a separate XML sitemap sidefile.

== XML sitemap ==
There is also an XML sitemap file format:
* http://sitemaps.org/
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map#XML_Sitemaps

However, this XML sitemap file is a [[sidefile]] that is subject to the same risks of [[feed file|feed files]].

=== Why XML sitemap ===
==== XML sitemap indexing ====
Google Webmaster Tools suggests[https://support.google.com/sites/answer/100283?hl=en] creating an XML file in the sitemaps.org format and submitting it with the claim that their crawler can "more intelligently crawl your site"[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en]. Despite that, they also say that using a sitemap "doesn't guarantee you that all the web pages listed in your sitemap can be crawled or indexed".

=== XML sitemap unnecessary ===
{{main|sidefile-antipattern}}

On 2014-12-18, {{aaronpk}} discovered that his sitemap.xml file had been empty, with no idea of how long it had been empty. Despite that, his content continues to be indexed by Google.
