'''<dfn>Scratch your own itch</dfn>''' is a metaphor for the IndieWeb [[principle]] ‚Äúmake what you need‚Äù that helps [[creator]]s focus on creating things that at least make a difference to their own lives.

Make tools for yourself first, not for all of your friends or ‚Äùeveryone‚Äú. If you design tools for some hypothetical user, they may not actually exist; if you make tools for yourself, you actually do exist. It's extremely hard to fight [[wikipedia:Metcalfe's law|Metcalfe's law]]: you won't be able to convince all your friends to join the independent web. By making something that satisfies your needs, and is backwards compatible for others, e.g. by practicing [[POSSE]], you benefit immediately, without having to convince anyone else. If and when others join, you all benefit.

== Brainstorming ==
There may be more broadly appealing ways of saying "Scratch your own itch". It's worth brainstorming about such potential replacements.

=== Make What You Need ===
More direct than a metaphor, '''make what you need''', expresses a method of focusing that parallels well with another principle, '''use what you make'''. As a metaphor, we could use "[[scratch_your_own_itch#Cook_What_You_Want|cook what you want]]" or "cook what you hunger" (see the [[scratch_your_own_itch#Cook_What_You_Want|next section]] for the cooking metaphor in particular).
* +1 {{t}} proposed "Make What You Need". I like "[[scratch_your_own_itch#Cook_What_You_Want|cook what you want]]" as the metaphorical expression (see below) because it parallels the "eat what you cook" metaphor, and cooking/eating is more tangible, more relatable to more people than the more abstract call to "make" something. Still I think our principles should be literal, not metaphorical.
* +1 {{chrisaldrich}}
* +1 {{aciccarello}} to "make what you want"
* +1 {{kasperzutterman}}
* +1 {{ana-r}} I prefer this one to any food analogies because "food" is a "content note" itself. I wonder if it could accidentally upset anyone with any relationship with food that they find difficult.
* +1 {{calumryan}} I agree Chris' - "make what you want" seems more appropriate, not to be confused with a focus in efforts on what is or isn't essential in the context of a website.

Or variant "make what you want". Not sure about need vs want as a focusing framing. Which is more similar to "itch"? Which is more broadly appealing?
* Perhaps the difference between the two is something which could be prioritized? Make first what you need, ''then'' make what you want, which allows one to focus on creativity and exploration. This is similar to the human need for attaining basics like food, clothing, and shelter and then creating something beyond that. Making what you want is definitely more aspirational and perhaps inspirational, though it can have the tendency to turn off those who don't have the basics yet. &mdash;{{chrisaldrich}}
* There‚Äôs a spectrum between need and want, that perhaps goes even farther:
** need - want - satisfied - full - annoyed - uncomfortable - overwhelmed
* I also think we need to be careful about drawing comparisons with "basic" needs, except to perhaps draw a contrast with creative activities. ‚Äî {{t}}

=== Cook What You Want ===
'''cook what you want''' is the counterpart (preceding) to [[eat what you cook]], and a metaphor for focusing your IndieWeb efforts on your own wants & needs first.
* +1 {{t}} ‚Äî I like this as the metaphorical expression of "make what you need" as the principle. The metaphor feels more approachable and specific (tangible/relatable) than "make what you need/want", and thus is a more direct replacement for "Scratch your own itch"
* +1 {{jacky}}
* +1 {{martymcguire}}
* +1 {{aciccarello}}
* +1 {{chrisaldrich}} this seems like one of the broadest and more welcoming framings and dovetails with the other side of the coin [[eat what you cook]]

Other similar metaphors:
* Write what you want to read
** Write the book you want to read

** "Write the story you want to say." (ibid)
* "Paint the painting you want to see." (ibid)
* "Sing the song you want to hear." (ibid)
* start the podcast that you want to listen to

More generically:
* Create the thing you want to consume
** +0 {{t}}: I like the abstraction from a broader understanding perspective, though then it loses the ease of relating (and positive emotional association) that a metaphor provides which I feel is more important especially for new folks

Thoughts on which metaphor:
* {{t}}: Of all those metaphor variants, I think "Cook what you want" is perhaps the most universal / approachable / relatable, as everyone wants to eat, and everyone has at least financial (nevermind health etc.) incentives to try to cook/prepare at least some of their food. It hits more fundamentally in Maslow's hierarchy (i.e. compared to writing, painting, podcasting, toolmaking). Though obviously even regarding food, there are real problems in terms of food deserts etc.

=== Be The Change ===
"scratch your own itch" is as much as admonition to actually do the "scratching" yourself, as well as prioritizing "your own itch". In this regard it is expressing the "Be the change" expression common in forms like:

* "Be the change you want to see in the world" ([https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Misattributed misattributed to Gandhi])
* "Change yourself and you have done your part in the changing the the world. Every individual must change [their] own life if they want to live in a peaceful world", [http://yogananda.com.au/para/p_peace.html#top from "Para-gram"] by Paramahansa Yogananda
* "If you want to make the world a better place, Take a look at yourself, and then make a change" - Michael Jackson, "Man In The Mirror" (all profits from that single went to charity apparently, per http://enwp.org/Michael_Jackson)

=== Create for Yourself ===

Make or create for yourself seems better than make what you want. It focuses the creation act as something you do for you, not for anyone else.

* +1 {{gwg}} proposed
* +0 {{aciccarello}} This sounds similar to what creators say (writers/artists/youtubers)
* +1 {{ana-r}} I also like this one. I interpreted it as a permission to make what you need and not to try to impress others.
* {{addyourself}}
