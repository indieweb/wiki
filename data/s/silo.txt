[[Category:silo]]
A '''<dfn>silo</dfn>''', or web content hosting silo, in the context of the IndieWeb, is a centralized web site (like most [[social media]]) typically owned by a for-profit corporation that stakes some claim to content contributed to it and restricts access in some way (has walls).

Silos are characterized by the following:
* require you to create an [[account]] specific to that site to use it (silo identity)
* allow you to interact on the site <em>only</em> with others with accounts on the site (silo contacts / social network)
* allows you to post some type of content (text, hypertext, images, video)
* and typically one or more of the following:
** an access wall that prevents indexing of (at least some of the) content you contribute
** a restrictive terms of service (TOS)
** claims some ownership or license to any content you create within the silo
** restricts your ability to import/export your content, or content about your content (e.g. comments, tags)

== Popular Silos ==
<div style="float:right">[http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2010/12/the-free-model.html http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d3df553ef0147e0e1aec2970b-300wi?x=.jpg]</div>
These silos are both popular, and used by a number of indiewebcamp community members (often via [[POSSE]]) to stay in touch with their friends.

* [[Facebook]]
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Google+]]
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Medium]]
* [[Pinterest]]
* [[Tumblr]]
* [[Twitter]]
* [[WordPress.com]] - of all these, WordPress.com has some of the best import/export support, very low walls as it were for a walled-garden.
* ...

If you have friends that are active on a popular silo, feel free to add it to this list.

== Specialized Silos ==
* [[Netflix]] - Movie ratings and reviews
* [[Nike+]] - tracks some [[exercise]] information
* [[Strava]] - GPS sport tracking
* [[Geocaching.com]] - [[geocaching]] activity tracking
* ...

Add any silo to this list that you're an active user of and especially if you can document how to export data from it.

== Silo Flexibility ==
A few silos have given users tremendous flexibility in the look and feel of their experience and the content they post.

Currently:
* [[Blogger]] - quite a bit of control via templates
* [[Tumblr]] - also lots of control via templates
* [[WordPress.com]] - some choice of free templates, and more choices as a paid option

Historically (but no longer)
* [[MySpace]] (~2002-2009?) - so much control over the HTML and CSS of your profile page that many compared it to [[GeoCities]], and not in a flattering way.

== Silo Innovations ==
Silos have innovated [[UX]] since 2003 far more than the blogging/RSS/Atom "communities" (as much as there was such a thing).

Here are some examples of UX innovations that silos either created, popularized, or refined to be much more usable, in rough temporal order.
* '''[[favorite]]s''' - [[Flickr]] (2004)
* '''Integrated [[reading]]/[[creating]] UI''' - [[LiveJournal]], [[Delicious]] (2004), [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]] (2006),  [[Facebook]] (2006? when did Facebook launch their Newsfeed?)
* '''[[checkin]]s''' - [[Dodgeball]] (2005), [[Foursquare]] (2009?), copied by [[Facebook]] (2010?)
* '''[[scrobble]]s''' - [[Last.fm]] (2000-2005? what year exactly?)
* '''[[block]]''' - [[Flickr]] (2005-07-27 per [https://www.flickr.com/help/contacts/#96], before that they had an [[ignore]] feature (superseded by block) which sounds like a harsher form of [[mute]])
* '''[[like]]s''' - introduced by [[FriendFeed]] 2007-10-03[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_button#Use_on_FriendFeed], then copied soon after by [[Facebook]] which quickly popularized them.
* '''[[reply-context]]''' - [[Twitter]] (20??-??-??). It was a small but important incremental step to go from [[reply]] posts on their own pages (see "User Innovation Inside Silos" below) to displaying the context of what those reply posts (tweets) were in reply to.
** '''[[recursive reply-context]]s''' - [[Twitter]]. Another incremental if obvious step, Twitter started displaying the reply contexts of reply contexts themselves, all the way on up to an original tweet.
*** Aaron Swartz invented this first - [https://web.archive.org/web/20130623214501/twitter.theinfo.org/114718659942940672 example]
* '''[[legacy contact]]''' - [[Facebook]] ([http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/02/adding-a-legacy-contact/ introduced 2015-02-12])
* ... add more and attribute the innovating silo

== User Innovations Inside ==
Despite silos typically exerting tight control over their look, feel, and overall user experience, users have found ways of innovating inside silos, which silos have often adopted and integrated into their UX.
* '''[[reply]] permalinks''' - [[Twitter]] - reply posts on their own permalinks instead of just fragment links on a post.
** Specifically, @-replies, were previously "only" in comments (e.g. comments in MySpace and Flickr used @-name conventions to indicate who they were responding to in a thread). When Twitter [https://twitter.com/rsa/status/55281 users started using @-reply syntax][https://web.archive.org/web/20121004103321/http://anarchogeek.com/2012/07/09/origin-of-the-reply-digging-through-twitters-history/][http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/26935842947/the-real-history-of-the-reply-on-twitter] in tweets to [https://twitter.com/kapowaz/statuses/139453 intentionally direct their tweets] at particular people, Twitter adopted this in multiple ways:
*** '''auto-link @-mentions''' to profile pages (was in response to user-behavior)
*** '''show @-reply tweets only to those who followed both''' the replier ''and'' the user being replied to.[https://blog.twitter.com/2008/how-replies-work-twitter-and-how-they-might]
*** '''auto-fill "Reply" textarea''' underneath a tweet with @-mention of the tweet author
*** auto-fill "Reply" textarea also with @-mentions of anyone else mentioned in the tweet.
* '''[[hashtags]]''' - as [https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412 proposed by Chris Messina][http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/] on [[Twitter]], then adopted by users, then eventually auto-linked by [[Twitter]] to search results for mentions of that hashtag.
* '''[[retweets]]''' - the "RT @-name:" syntax ([https://twitter.com/ericrice/status/31669791 originally ReTweet:]) was purely [https://twitter.com/TDavid/status/641334922 a user innovation] to indicate that they were passing along text/content from another user. [[Twitter]] both:
** codified "RT" into a one-click button (so easy to use as to cause million+ retweeted posts)
** showed the original author of the tweet, when presenting the retweet in others' reading views.
* '''üçû for [[like]]''' - [[Ello]] users in Germany adopted a convention of typing ":bread:" to generate a bread emoji (üçû) in a comment as a simple indicator of "liking" a post, since Ello lacks an explicit like/favorite feature.
* ... add more user innovation inside silos with attribution to user(s) if known, and inside which silo.

== Criticism ==
See [[why]] for more common issues with silos in contrast to having your own website.

=== Linkwrapping ===
Many silos wrap any links posted on them with their own domains or link-wrapping domains, sometimes in an attempt to make links shorter, sometimes to provide a bottleneck which they can use to mass disable spam/phishing links. 

Downsides:
* '''Breaks link referrals''' (you just see the silo wrapper, not the actual post that linked to your domain)
* '''Fragile''' for all the usual link-shorteners by a site other than the owner are fragile problem. As well as their typical use of [[database]] ids.

Examples:
* [[Facebook]]: m.facebook.com/l.php...[https://twitter.com/kyle_wm/status/446818317408280576]
* [[Twitter]]: t.co
* [[Feedly]]: [http://indiewebcamp.com/File:silo-urls.jpg Feedly Short URL fail]
* ... others?

=== Artificially Slow UI ===
* 2016-07-06 [http://www.fastcodesign.com/3061519/evidence/the-ux-secret-that-will-ruin-apps-for-you/ The UX Secret That Will Ruin Apps For You] <blockquote>Facebook actually slows down its interface to make users feel safe, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed in an email.<br/><br/>... various services on the web including travel sites, mortgage engines, and security checks are all making a conscious effort to slow down their omnipotent minds because our puny human brains expect things to take longer.<br/><br/>... companies introduce what Kowitz calls an "artificial waiting" pattern into their interfaces. These are status bars, maybe a few update messages, to construct a facade of slow, hard, thoughtful work, even though the computer is done calculating your query.</blockquote>

Another good reason to [[selfdogfood|use your own tools]] (if it's faster than expected, you feel accomplished, not distrusting), or at least re-use indieweb software etc. that others are selfdogfooding because you know they won't be (or there's at least less chance of them) deliberately slowing it down.

=== Perverse Incentives on Content ===

<blockquote> While it seems like platforms today are more interested in investing in the users responsible for their success via grants and creators programs aplenty, the reality is that the platform still dictates the terms. They‚Äôre not only the point of access to your audience; they‚Äôre also the ones deciding what metrics to use, and what counts as a success‚Äîand all of that is subject to change over any given quarter</blockquote>

<blockquote> On Instagram, the idea that accounts should make use of all the features the platform promotes in order to be successful lies somewhere between an open secret and industry-accepted theory. (This is at least partly why your chef influencer friend keeps posting Reels‚Ä¶)</blockquote>

If you create content on someone else‚Äôs platform, they can force you to make your content using a certain style or method by ranking you based on their own performance metrics.

== Silo Quitting ==

* [[silo-quits]]

== Vaporware Silos ==
From time to time, silo projects are announced without shipping, and often never ship. As this list grows we can consider creating a separate [[vaporware-silos]] page.
