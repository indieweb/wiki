'''<dfn>sanitize</dfn>''', specifically "<dfn>sanitizing</dfn> HTML", "sanitizing for (display inside) HTML", or "<dfn>sanitization</dfn>" is a common operation performed by any site which displays content from external sources, including user entry. It is often used to standardize appearance, to prevent broken code in the external content from breaking the site itself, and most importantly to prevent code injection attacks from malicious sources.

[[Comments]] (and thus [[comments-presentation]]) is one particularly obvious area where sanitizing of some degree is essential.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(this section is a stub)
* ... who does what when they receive comments via [[webmention]] or [[Bridgy]] ?

== Software Examples ==
* [[Idno]]/[[Known]] currently aggressively strips tags.
** Details? All HTML tags?
* [[Mastodon]] does [https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#sanitization HTML sanitization], with very minimal HTML allowlists of:
** elements: <code>a, br, p, span</code>
** class names ([[mf2]] or other semantics): <code>h-*, p-*, u-*, dt-*, e-*, mention, hashtag, ellipsis, invisible</code>
** and [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/23913 soon]:
*** elements: <code>del, pre, blockquote, code, b, strong, u, i, em, ul, ol, li</code>
*** transforms: <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> tags to <code><nowiki><p><strong>contents</strong></p></nowiki></code>
* [[WordPress]] has a [http://wpbtips.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/html-allowed-in-comments-2/ small allowlist of tags]: 
** <code>a, abbr, acronym, b, blockquote, cite, code, pre, del, em, i, q, strike, strong</code>. 
** It also has allowlists of attributes within those tags.
* [[Pleroma]] [https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/frontend/user_guide/posting_reading_basic_functions/#rich-text optionally lets users author] in [[Markdown]], [[BBCode]], or raw HTML. They don't document an explicit list of allowed HTML tags though.
* [[Friendica]] [https://wiki.friendi.ca/docs/bbcode lets users author in] [[BBCode]], but doesn't document an explicit list of allowed HTML tags either.

== Service Examples ==
* [[micro.blog]] has a list of [https://help.micro.blog/t/timeline-display-rules/29#allowed-html-tags-1 Allowed HTML tags] and their attributes:
** elements: <code>a, audio, b, blockquote, br, code, div, em, i, img, li, ol, p, pre, source, span, strong, ul, video</code>
** attributes on each:
*** a: <code>href, title, class</code>
*** span: <code>style, class</code>
*** img: <code>src, style, class, width, height, alt</code>
*** audio: <code>src, controls</code>
*** video: <code>src, controls, width, height, preload, poster, alt, playsinline, style, class</code>
*** source: <code>src, type</code>
** <code>style</code> attribute allowed properties:
*** <code>width, height, max-width, max-height, min-width, min-height, border</code>

== Approaches ==
There are numerous approaches to sanitizing / filtering for HTML.
E.g.
* only allow [[plaintext]]
* allow only allowlisted HTML tags
* allow all HTML but strip &lt;script&gt; etc.

== User Experience ==
=== Literal text ===
Users typically expect that whatever they type into a comment box will be shown literally, e.g. if a user types in:

<pre><nowiki>if b<a and a>c then you do not know whether b>c</nowiki></pre>

They expect to see that text in the comment.

What you might see, due to perhaps overly aggressive sanitizing (e.g. a regex) that thinks it is removing HTML:

<pre>if bc then you do not know whether b>c</pre>

=== Some markup ===
Other sites, e.g. [[Flickr]] permit user entry of a few tags so that users may add explicit hyperlinks, and some amount of text formatting to their comments.
