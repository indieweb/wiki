'''<dfn>sanitize</dfn>''', specifically "<dfn>sanitizing</dfn> HTML", "sanitizing for (display inside) HTML", or "<dfn>sanitization</dfn>" is a common operation performed by any site which displays content from external sources, including user entry.

[[Comments]] (and thus [[comments-presentation]]) is one particularly obvious area where sanitizing of some degree is essential.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* ... who does what when they receive comments via [[webmention]] or [[Bridgy]] ?
* [[Idno]] currently aggressively strips tags.
* [[WordPress]] only allows a [http://wpbtips.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/html-allowed-in-comments-2/ small whitelist of tags]: <code>a, abbr, acronym, b, blockquote, cite, code, pre, del, em, i, q, strike, strong</code>. It also whitelists attributes within those tags.

== Approaches ==
There are numerous approaches to sanitizing / filtering for HTML.
E.g.
* only allow [[plaintext]]
* allow only whitelisted HTML tags
* allow all HTML but strip &lt;script&gt; etc.
* ...

== User Experience ==
=== Literal text ===
Users typically expect that whatever they type into a comment box will be shown literally, e.g. if a user types in:

<pre><nowiki>if b<a and a>c then you do not know whether b>c</nowiki></pre>

They expect to see that text in the comment.

What you might see, due to perhaps overly aggressive sanitizing (e.g. a regex) that thinks it is removing HTML:

<pre>if bc then you do not know whether b>c</pre>

=== Some markup ===
Other sites, e.g. [[Flickr]] permit user entry of a few tags so that users may add explicit hyperlinks, and some amount of text formatting to their comments.
