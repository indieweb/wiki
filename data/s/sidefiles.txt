'''<dfn>sidefiles</dfn>''' is a term used for the practice of generating additional files or content to present a similar resource. An example of this would be advertising a [[h-feed]] that also has a [[RSS]] feed of the same content.

== Use Cases ==
* RSS or ATOM feeds can be advertised using <code>rel=feed</code> on [[h-feed]] to provide support with a conventional [[feed_reader|reader]]
* Alternative formats of pictures, audio and videos could be considered sidefiles when used with <kbd>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source &lt;source&gt;]</kbd>.

== Criticisms ==
See [[sidefile-antipattern]] for the critique about the use of sidefiles.
