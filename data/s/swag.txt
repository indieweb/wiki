'''<dfn>swag</dfn>''' is indieweb apparel and accessories you can purchase.

The IndieWebCamp store, where you can purchase stickers, t-shirts, and other IndieWeb swag, is available at [https://shop.indieweb.org/ shop.indieweb.org].

== Stickers ==
You can get [[stickers]] at most IndieWebCamp and Homebrew Website Club meetups! Just ask an organizer! (If you're an organizer and want to get a stash of stickers to give out, get in touch with {{aaronpk}}!)
