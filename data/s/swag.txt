'''<dfn>swag</dfn>''' is indieweb apparel and accessories you can purchase.

== Stickers ==
You can get stickers at most IndieWebCamp and Homebrew Website Club meetups! Just ask an organizer! (If you're an organizer and want to get a stash of stickers to give out, get in touch with {{aaronpk}}!)

If you create a Stickermule account, you can order your own sticker packs directly from [https://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=9668429601 Stickermule]. Small quantities of stickers are relatively expensive, so it only makes sense if you order at least 100. {{aaronpk}} also occasionally makes large orders, so he may be able to ship you batches as well much cheaper.
