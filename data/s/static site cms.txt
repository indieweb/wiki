[[Category:CMS]]

A graphical website management system that generates static files, which then can be viewed without the CMS running.

In contrast to [[static site generator]]s, static site CMSes allow non-technical users to edit the web sites in the browser in a graphical way, without needing to edit files - a GUI for static sites.
