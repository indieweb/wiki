'''<dfn>static web hosting</dfn>''' is a [[web hosting]] service (AKA <dfn>static hosting</dfn> or <dfn>file hosting</dfn>) that only supports serving static files for a web site, is often more reliable, cheaper (some are free), a good way to [[get started]] on the IndieWeb, and used by many community members.

== Why ==
=== Advantages ===
* Very cheap (sometimes free). See [[Amazon_S3#Date_Edge|Amazon Date Edge's usage/billing]].
* Solutions like [[GitHub Pages]] and [[Netlify]] integrate well with standard source control operations. When you push a commit to GitHub, tools like Pages and Netlify automatically update your site.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Can be complicated to set up
* Require external services for dynamic functions such as receiving [[Webmention]]s, publishing with [[Micropub]], etc.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members using this approach:
* {{xtof}} (JAMStack GitHub + Netlify's [[CDN]]) ([https://www.christopheducamp.com/2016/12/30/sauvegarde-2017 settings here])
* {{jamietanna}} hosts www.jvt.me on Netlify, which was previously hosted on his own infrastructure
* [[User:Tomasparks.name]] I use [[Linode]]'s s3 and [[backblaze_b2]].
* {{corlaez}} hosts ([https://corlaez.com/ corlaez.com]) on ([https://render.com/ render.com])

== Static web hosting services ==
=== GitHub Pages ===
{{main|GitHub Pages}}
* [https://pages.github.com GitHub Pages] (free) - GitHub Pages is designed for hosting simple static web pages. In addition to [https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages github's instructions], there are several guides on how to use GitHub Pages to host your website:
** Based on [[Jekyll]]
** http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/extras/github-pages.html
** Example: [http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/08/11/now-powered-by-jekyll-and-github-pages/ BootStrap blog powered by Jekyll and Github pages]
** An advantage to using a Github based solution is that you can easily transfer it to another web host simply by deploying from github to your web host.
* GitHub Actions give you control over when and how your website deploys. You can schedule your site to be deployed at a particular time. This is useful if you have posts written for future dates on your Jekyll blog.
