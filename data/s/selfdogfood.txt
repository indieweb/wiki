{{emojicon|üòã}}
'''<dfn>selfdogfood</dfn>''' is metaphor and a historical IndieWeb encouragement to use your own creations and depend on them personally yourself, beyond just self-testing or [[dogfooding]] a work project; on the IndieWeb, it means using your creations on your <em>personal site</em> as an aspect of your <em>primary online identity</em>, day to day.

For an updated metaphor, see:
* [[eat what you cook]]

For the broader IndieWeb [[principle]], see:
* [[use what you make]]

== Why not ==
For why not to use "selfdogfood" as a metaphor for the [[use what you make]] principle, see criticism of the term "selfdogfood", especially with respect to "dog" or "dogfood":

== FAQ ==
=== Use and development ===

''Are there two dimensions to selfdogfooding: use and development?''

A: There are many required aspects of selfdogfooding, use and development are only two of them.

== silos do it too ==
Selfdogfooding indicates some degree of being the first to test your creations by using them yourself, in production. Some social media silos do this as well, perhaps not always intentionslly:

== Replacement Discussion ==
Chat <span id="Discussion">discussion</span> several times brought up the suggestion that a more broadlyappealing term should be used by the community.

After much discussion and awaiting more input, the following replacements had the most community support:
* [[eat what you cook]] ‚Äî as a replacement metaphor
* [[use what you make]] - as the general principle

Options discussed:

=== eat your cooking ===
As discussed: https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2019-02-05, related suggestions:
* '''eating what you make'''
* '''Cooking your Own Dinner'''
* '''eating our own cooking''' - From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#Alternative_terms: <blockquote>Developers of IBM's mainframe operating systems have long used the term "eating our own cooking".</blockquote>
* '''eat what you cook'''
** +1 {{kevinmarks}}: monosyllables are more emphatic. we'll need to update the dogfood + self explanation above
** +1 {{jeremycherfas}} I like this version too.
** +1 {{t}} I like this as an emphatic call to action. Would still want a noun for the actual practice, e.g. '''eating what you cook''', and a verb that can be inged (but can't think of one).
** +1 {{aaronpk}} I like this version best
** +0 {{gRegor}} I'm not totally sold on the food/cooking options, but out of them I like this one best
**  {{miklb.com}} the reality is when you cook for a living, you rarely eat what you cook. I'd go as far as to say historically even in the home the main food maker rarely eats everything they cook. Also feels very close to the "eat what you kill" idiom
** +1 {{JackyAlcine}} Personally, this aligns with me more. Also in the realm of consumption of content, it makes sense; we should be the ones creating and at least sampling what we put out there.
** +1 {{schmarty}} Agree w/ the folks who voted for this one before. Quite like it!
* '''eat your cooking'''
** +1 {{t}} nice parallel structure with "[[own your data]]". And the noun for the actual practice could be '''eating your cooking''' ("your ''own''" seems redundant). How do you "verb" this without a pronoun?
*** We can replace wiki usage of "selfdogfooding" as an adjective (e.g. on project pages listing the author as an IndieWeb Example) with "eating her own cooking" / "eating his own cooking"
** +1 {{eddiehinkle.com}}: this is nice because it doesn‚Äôt use specific food or drink. A challenge is the length, there is no way to really shorten it. But it is simple which means it should be easy to remember.
** +0 {{aaronpk}} sounds a little funny to me but I like the sentiment
** -0.5 {{gRegor}} sounds funny to me too
** +0 {{schmarty}} has a "eat your vegetables" ring for me.

=== use what you create ===
{{gRegor}}: The more I think about it, I'm wondering if we actually need a metaphor. It feels like an unnecessary abstraction. The current definition isn't too long - "use your own creations and depend on them yourself" - and I think "use what you create" works as a reasonable shorthand.
* Advantage: no metaphor needed, directly conveys the principle
Opinions:
* +1 {{t}} - this is worth considering in the running. It may not be as emotionally compelling as "eat your cooking" or "eat what you cook" yet it may be more effective in reaching some broader audiences.
* +1 {{gRegor}} in addition to my initial thoughts, this is easier to translate to other languages. Currently I like the create/build/make variants of this equally.
* ...

==== use what you make ====
On [https://cathieleblanc.com/ her home page], Cathie uses the variant "Use what you make" as a deliberate summary replacement for "selfdogfood", which has explicity been the summary of this in our [[principles]] since the [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=principles&type=revision&diff=40823&oldid=29323 revision as of 2017-09-24].

Opinions:
* +1 {{t}} 
* +1 {{gRegor}} see comment above
* +1 {{prtksxna}} easy to understand and translate
* ...

==== use what you build ====
Similarly, Cathie LeBlanc has proposed in her 2019 article <cite>[https://cathieleblanc.com/2019/03/24/alternative-to-the-corporate-web/ An Alternative to the Corporate Web]</cite>:

<blockquote>Build what you need, use what you build</blockquote>

In the context of [[different]] which has a point on "Selfdogfood" which also references "Scratch your own itch".

* "Build what you need" is a clear replacement for "Scratch your own itch"
* "Use what you build" is a clear replacement for "Selfdogfood". Previously [https://twitter.com/slamteacher/status/568821669277487104 at eLearning 2015 John Seely Brown quoted as saying that].
Opinions:
* +1 {{t}} ‚Äî this is also a good rephrasing 
* +1 {{gRegor}} see comment above
* +1 {{prtksxna}} easy to understand and translate
* ...

=== walk your talk ===
{{benwerd}}: this is often used in non-product circles. It's defined as "you should do what you tell other people to do". In a software development context, this can easily be extended to mean "you should use what you create".
* +0 {{t}} While I appreciate this sentiment I think something like this "create what you suggest" is a distinct principle IMO that can be used before "use what you create".

=== Rejected Alternatives ===
Alternatives to "selfdogfood" that have been discussed and sufficiently rejected to not bother considering as an actual replacement.

If you would like to one of these reconsidered, please start a discussion about it in the meta [[discuss]]ion channel.

==== use your own product ====
* http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-06-09#t1402337824
** {{gRegor}} likes the simple phrase "use your own product" or <abbr>UYOP</abbr> if an acronym is preferred. It's simple and to the point.
** -0 {{t}}: It's better than "selfdogfood" but it's also just vague enough to fail to capture the making/creating aspect, e.g. even "user your own creations" would better capture that. Also "product" feels a bit too corporate rather than indie.
** -0 {{gRegor}} this is really old at this point and was probably more off-the-cuff comment at the time. Agreed on "product" now, and wondering how necessary a metaphor is.
** -0 {{aaronpk}} agreed, too vague
** -1 {{chrisaldrich}} also reminiscent of the drug culture phase (with negative connotations) of "don't get high on your own supply"

==== drinking our own champagne ====
From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#Alternative_terms
* '''Drinking your own champagne''', or '''self-champagneing'''
** or just '''champagneing'''; doesn't need distinguish it from a preexisting term
** {{eddiehinkle.com}}: this seems potentially appealing because it touches on the food/drink area but can easily be shortened with ‚Äúchampagneing‚Äù.
** -1 {{jeremycherfas}} If we're going to be sensitive about how some people respond to dog, should we not also be aware that there are those who respond badly to being encouraged to drink alcohol?
** {{kevinmarks}}: There's a nice connection with Homebrew Website Club, but '''drinking our own beer''' may make this even more confusing with actual brewing clubs. 
*** It also sounds like a euphemism for drinking your own urine.
*** {{t}}: '''drink your brew''' (could be tea, coffee, kombucha etc.) would be more inclusive, yet may still have the problem mentioned above.
** -1 {{t}}: I personally like occasional champagne, however this feel exclusionary and/or triggering of anyone who is a recovering alcoholic. Also as {{jeremycherfas}} says, it implies an encouragement to drink alcohol which is widely seen (lots of articles) as a negative aspect of many tech/OSS subcultures. "self-champagneing" sounds like it could mean pouring champagne over yourself and making a mess.
** -1 {{aaronpk}}: while I am definitely [https://aaronparecki.com/search?q=sparkling+wine a fan of champagne], I agree that it's not inclusive
** -1 {{benwerd}}: lots of people don't drink for all kinds of personal reasons. I definitely wouldn't want to accidentally exclude devoutly muslim developers, for example. Alcohol-based metaphors (along with alcohol-based events) should probably be avoided.

==== self-kool-aiding ====
* '''Self-kool-aiding''' ‚Äî also has the connotation of buying into your own spiel
** -1 {{gRegor}}: I dislike this one for the negative connotation of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#Deaths_in_Jonestown Jonestown massacre] (CW: suicide)
** -1 {{eddiehinkle.com}}: agreed, this is not a good replacement, same reasons {{gRegor}} listed.
** -1 {{aaronpk}} same

==== Lightsaber ====
* '''Build your own lightsaber''' ‚Äî unsure of origin, but I heard it used in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp7S6QUnpiE&feature=youtu.be&t=8m13s this video]. {{gRegor}}

In the <em>Star Wars</em> mythology about lightsabers, you (a Jedi) have *only* one, that you are expected to have *built* it *yourself*, and that you *depend* on as an extension of your *self*.

Contrasting examples:
* '''dogfood''': In Ep1, Anakin is merely dogfooding C3P0, which he built to also help his mom. Even though he cares about it, C3P0 is not part of Anakin. No aspect of identity/self.
* '''selfdogfood''': In RoJ, Luke is selfdogfooding his own lightsaber that he made. It's his only lightsaber, he made it, he depends on it as an extension of himself.

* {{eddiehinkle.com}}: this is fun but too niche.
* -0 {{t}} agreed. I like this analogy a lot, however it is both a bit dated, and a bit too insidery. Could be good as a blog post anecdote/analogy for explaining the concept though.

==== Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps ====
* To 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' is to improve your situation by your own efforts. This phrase seems very apt in that it is generally positive and puts the reliance on individuals instead of corporate silos. It's also relatively well known and has prior history [https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps.html 1] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pull_oneself_up_by_one%27s_bootstraps 2] including one relating to early computing. It could have a shorter noun form, but does have a verb forms in "bootstrapped" and "bootstrapping".
* Example usage: "I was able to bootstrap a very functional personal website with some help from the IndieWeb wiki."
** -1 {{t}} I used to like this phrase and yet I have seen it pointed out that it's a very privileged viewpoint, and often used as a libertarian dogwhistle, not something I would want to propagate or reinforce. In addition, this phrase implies some degree of "without (asking for or expecting or using) anyone else's help" which is very much NOT what the IndieWeb community is about. Some links for more:

** -1 {{benwerd}} It is usually referred to in software in the context of going without investment dollars. I strongly agree that a different phrase should be found, and it's no surprise to me that the investment community used a phrase strongly associated with libertarianism. It should also not be defined in opposition to VC; it should be simply one more avenue to build something (in the process semantically demoting VC from the "default" to also just one tool).

== testing your code in production ==
<span style="float:right">http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5269/5616559901_8ca0186c11_z.jpg</span>

Whilst testing your code in production is a good part of selfdogfooding, security precautions should still be taken. Showing errors, warnings and notices usually reserved for dev environments is a huge security risk due to the fact that things like paths, usernames, secret keys, etc. might be inadvertently shown to anyone who cares to look. It‚Äôs also not a great idea to have confusing error messages intermingled with content.

Rather, you should log all such messages somewhere where only you can see them, or only show them in-page if you‚Äôre logged in as an admin.

In PHP, there are several ways to go about this.

* Setting <code>display_errors off</code> in your php.ini
* Within PHP: <code>ini_set('display_errors', 'off');</code>
* For a single line: <code>@codeWhichIsCausingErrors();</code>
* If you‚Äôre logged in as an admin: <pre>if ($user->isAdmin()) ini_set('display_errors', 'on');</pre>
