'''<dfn>[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events server-sent events]</dfn>''' is a DOM API for receiving push [[notifications]] from a server via [[HTTP]]. Unlike [[websockets]], they're designed for one-way communication between a Web server and a client (Web browser, another Web server or a client application).

== Why ==
Server-sent events are one way to implement [[real-time comments]] display on your posts.

== How ==
How does one implement server-sent events, especially in combination with a comment updating system?
