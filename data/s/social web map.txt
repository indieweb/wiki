<span class="p-summary">The '''<dfn id="Social_Web_Map">social web map</dfn>''' is a metaphoric map of social web sites, from fully indieweb to silos, representing their relationships, sizes, levels of [[IndieMark]] accomplishment (or [[site-death]]) and any other axes of interesting details we can capture.</span>

{{warning|This page is out of date since 2015 and needs updates at least in terms of examples given, and perhaps the confederation / league / alliance taxonomy, as well as lists of silos, some of which have [[site-deaths|gone underwater]] since}}

Inspired by:
* [http://xkcd.com/256/ 2007 Map of Online Communities]
* [http://web.archive.org/web/20120112002833/http://www.flowtown.com/blog/the-2010-social-networking-map 2010 Social Networking Map]

This started out as a brainstorm to create a 2013 Social Web Map, with the IndieWeb at the center, and different levels of indieness out from there. However anyone is encouraged to create such a map, with current information, or update the categories of sites below with any fitting additions, deletions, or changes in category.

== Sections ==
Lists of map features - and how sites are included in them.

=== IndieWeb Confederation ===
IndieWeb sites that are actively [[POSSE]]ing and successfully federating [[comments]] (e.g. to Eschnou's post).
* Eschnou.com
* Aaronparecki.com
* Christopher Ducamp
* Barnaby Walters
* Tom Morris
* ...

=== IndieWeb League ===
Superset of the IndieWeb Confederation. IndieWeb sites that are automatically [[POSSE]]ing [[posts]] of at least one type out to a Silo Island Nation (that they're only POSSEing to). E.g. at least one Silo Nation destination where the IndieWeb site owner is ''only'' posting via POSSEing from their own website, never directly on the Silo Nation destination.
* Tantek.com
** all [[notes]] & [[articles]] since 2010 (and all [[replies]] since 2013-05-12) are 
*** POSSEd to [[Twitter]], then all non-@-replies indirectly to [[Facebook]]
*** POSSEd to [[FriendFeed]]
* Adactio.com - all [[articles]] since 2011?
** POSSEd to [[Facebook]] with [[IFTTT]]
* ...

For more use Bridgy stats, e.g.:
* https://snarfed.org/2014-11-06_happy-1000th-bridgy#activity  
to discover and document additional IndieWeb sites that are using Bridgy Publish to POSSE to silos

=== IndieWeb Alliance ===
Superset of the IndieWeb League. IndieWebCamp participants (either in person or remote) who have at least an independent identity on their own domain, but ideally regularly post multiple kinds of posts on their own domain. 
* Kevin Marks - kevinmarks.com
* Chris Wilson - cwilso.com
* ...

[[Getting Started]] with setting up [[IndieAuth]]/[[RelMeAuth]] on your own domain puts you on the map.

=== POSSE land bridges ===
[[POSSE]] land bridges to various Silo Island Nation Destinations.
* [[Bridgy]] Publish
* [[IFTTT]]
* [[PuSH]]
* ...

Include and represent [[backfeed]] support / usage as well? E.g.
* [[Bridgy]] backfeed users
* sites doing their own backfeed subscribing / polling

=== Silo Island Nation Destinations ===
[[Silos]] that IndieWeb participants are POSSEing out to (direct or indirectly)
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Twitter]]
* [[App.net]]
* [[Flickr#IndieWeb_Examples|Flick]]
* [[Foursquare|Foursquare#POSSE]]
* ...

Dead:
* See [[#Dead_Web_Sea]]

=== Silo Island Nations ===
Possible to POSSE to (but no one is yet):
* [[Tumblr]]
* ...

Impossible to POSSE to:
* [[Instagram]]
* ...

=== Dead Web Sea ===
Sites that have died, depth by how recently they've disappeared. See [[site-deaths]]

* [[Friendfeed]]
* [[Upcoming]]
* [[Posterous]]
* [[Buzz]] - used to receive POSSE copies from tantek.com via [[PuSH]]
* [[Geocities]]
* [[Yahoo 360]]
* [[Wave]]
* [[Pownce]]
* [[Vox]]
* [[Gowalla]]
* ...
