<blockquote>Much like profile pages found on social sites and crowdfunding sites (like [[Patreon]], [[Kickstarter]], [[Go Fund Me]], [[Facebook]], etc.) this page is the beginning of showing which organizations, institutions, artists, and other entities which I‚Äôm supporting with a mixture of my time, talent and/or treasure. If you‚Äôre looking for something to support yourself, I can highly recommend any of the following which include links to the organization as well as ways to support them.</blockquote>
