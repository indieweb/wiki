=== Offline Reading of Posts ===
* {{kartikprabhu}} enable offline reading of posts using service worker. when you visit my site, it allows you to cache some article offline. then later you can read my article without network. can also be implemented for [[readers]] though. could also be useful in [[micropub]] clients for saving drafts of posts offline, so you can write your post without connection, then sync/publish when you get back the network
