'''<dfn>service worker</dfn>'''s are [[javascript|scripts]] that run in the background, separate from tabs with the site open, and are commonly used for [[offline]] functionality and push notifications.

== Why ==
Why would you want to add a Service Worker to your site? Many reasons, though most commonly:
* '''[[offline]] support''' — allow visitors to still browse (parts of) your site when not connected. Ideally start with [[offline first]] support.
* '''local support''' — allow visitors (including yourself!) to interact with your site locally, independent of any network connection (thus not blocked / slowed by) and then sync those interactions in the background

For a broader introduction including more reasons why, see:

== Brainstorming ==
Things to maybe try doing with Service Workers
=== Offline Reading of Posts ===
* {{kartikprabhu}} enable offline reading of posts using service worker. when you visit my site, it allows you to cache some article offline. then later you can read my article without network. can also be implemented for [[readers]] though. could also be useful in [[micropub]] clients for saving drafts of posts offline, so you can write your post without connection, then sync/publish when you get back the network
