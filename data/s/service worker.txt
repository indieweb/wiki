'''<dfn>service worker</dfn>'''s are [[javascript|scripts]] that run in the background, separate from tabs with the site open, and are commonly used for [[offline]] functionality and push notifications.

== Why ==
Why would you want to add a service worker to your site? Many reasons, though most commonly:
* '''[[offline]] support''' — allow visitors to still browse (parts of) your site when not connected. Ideally start with [[offline first]] support. See [[offline#Why]] for more reasons.
* '''[[local first|local support]]''' — allow visitors (including yourself!) to interact with your site locally, independent of any network connection (thus not blocked / slowed by) and then sync those interactions in the background.

For a broader introduction including more reasons why, see:
