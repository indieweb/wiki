'''<dfn>Static site generator</dfn>s''' or '''<dfn>SSG</dfn>s''' are programs that take a set of flat text files on disk and transforms them into a set of static [[HTML]] files ready to be served by a standard web [[server]], or some variation of this example.


For details on implementations and examples of [[building blocks|IndieWeb building blocks]] with static site generators, see also

== Advantages == 
* Long term maintenance advantages
* Archival ready html output
* Can be hosted on any webserver
* No "moving parts"; nothing to break
* Easy to get started
* Source files can be edited on an operating system.  Usually its just text files!
* Generators are typically fairly simple programs to write and modify
* Lots of existing options; Few are better than most
* No [[database-antipattern]]
* Fewer security vulnerabilities with static HTML+CSS
* ...


== Disadvantages ==
* Most SSGs are written as CLI programs and are difficult for non-technical people to learn
* Can be difficult to install due to the use of programming language package managers
* Most SSGs don't scale well with large data sets
* ...


== Popular and Documented SSGs ==

* [[Hakyll]]
* [[Harp]]
* [[Hugo]]
* [[Jekyll]]
** Jekyll has support for an [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/incremental-regeneration/ "incremental build"] mode which only builds files that have been changed. This reduces the deploy time after a cache has been built of posts.
