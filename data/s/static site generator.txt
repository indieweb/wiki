'''<dfn>Static site generator</dfn>s''' are programs that take a set of flat text files on disk and transforms them into a set of static html files ready to be served by a standard web server, or some variation of this example.


== Advantages == 
* Long term maintenance advantages
* Archival ready html output
* Can be hosted on any webserver
* No "moving parts"; nothing to break
* Easy to get started
* Source files can be edited on an operating system.  Usually its just text files!
* Generators are typically fairly simple programs to write and modify
* Lots of existing options; Few are better than most
* No [[database-antipattern]]
* Fewer security vulnerabilities with static HTML+CSS
* ...

* Most SSGs are written as CLI programs and are difficult for non-technical people to learn
* Can be difficult to install due to the use of programming language package managers
* Most SSGs don't scale well with large data sets
* ...
