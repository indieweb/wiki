'''<dfn>safety status</dfn>''' is a particular type of post (with a permalink) that indicates a person's safety during a disaster event and can be posted by a person or by one of their friends. Such posts are typically shown as a [[marked safe]] notification to [[followers]], and aggregated on a [[safety check]] page.
