'''<dfn>schema.org</dfn>''' is a set of vocabularies created by a group at [[Google]], in some cases based on existing vocabularies like [[microformats]] [[hCard]], and in others re-inventing vocabularies instead of re-using specs like [[Atom]] or [[RSS]], then co-launched in 2011 with fellow search-engine [[Microsoft]] Bing, and their search licensee [[Yahoo]], still run by them and additional search engine [[Yandex]].
