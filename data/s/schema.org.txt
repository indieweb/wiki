'''<dfn>schema.org</dfn>''' is a set of vocabularies created by a group at [[Google]], in some cases based on existing vocabularies like [[microformats]] [[hCard]], and in others re-inventing vocabularies instead of re-using specs like [[Atom]] or [[RSS]], then co-launched in 2011 with fellow search-engine [[Microsoft]] Bing, and their search licensee [[Yahoo]], still run by them and additional search engine [[Yandex]].

== Criticism ==
=== Overdesigned nonsense vocabularies ===
Due to its hierarchical class structure and attempt to be too many things to too many requests (not actual use-cases) Schema.org contains a number of very strange and useless vocabulary properties. 

One that is often brought up as an example of this is the fact that a schema.org "Volcano" object has a "faxNumber" property, which is sufficiently obviously nonsensical that it serves as a good illustration of the methodological flaws in Schema.orgâ€™s design, and is the reason for the emojicon ðŸŒ‹ðŸ“  at the top of the page.

* 2014-06-25 {{kevinmarks}} gave a talk at Google I/O which gave the volcano fax number example as a criticism of Schema-org. Commentary:

* 2014-09-29 https://chat.indieweb.org/2014-09-29/1412016923789000 <blockquote>like you have no idea if your Volcano will show up with a fax machine in its rich snippet</blockquote>

* 2017-05-22 https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/866690285056741377 <blockquote>All vocab use is a social understanding. Volcanoes don't really have fax numbers, whatever the vocab says.</blockquote>
