'''<dfn><nowiki>stalkscan.com</nowiki></dfn>''' was a [[Facebook]] searching service which let you find all 'public' data for any user, including content not in Facebook's export. The service was last available in early 2020 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20200206120750/http://www.stalkscan.com:80/ archive]), then the domain was put up for sale, and eventually [[lost site|went offline]].

== Features ==
StalkScan provided data with much deeper granularity than Facebook itself provided. 

Originally, data on all accounts was available via the Graph Search API, but after 2019-06-06, it only provided a user's own account data. StalkScan was useful to access content for [[PESOS]] such as your comments on other posts that was not available in the Facebook export.
