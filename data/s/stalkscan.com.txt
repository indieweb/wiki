'''<dfn>[https://stalkscan.com/ stalkscan.com]</dfn>''' was a [[Facebook]] searching service which let you find all 'public' data for any user, including content not in Facebook's export. The service was last available in early 2020 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20200206120750/http://www.stalkscan.com:80/ archive]).

== Features ==

StalkScan provided data with much deeper granularity than Facebook itself provided. Originally, data on all accounts was available via the Graph Search API, but after June 6, 2019 only a user's own account was available. StalkScan was useful to access content for [[PESOS]] such as comments on others' posts that was not available in the Facebook export.
