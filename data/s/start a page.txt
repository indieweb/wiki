To '''<dfn>start a page</dfn>''' on the indiewebcamp wiki, either

* Edit an existing page. Add a link to ''new-page'', then save the page.
* Click the ''new-page'' link, then click "edit this page."
'''or'''
* Type the URL of the desired page directly into the browser address bar, then click "edit this page."


Then start by copy pasting the following:
<blockquote><nowiki>
{{stub}}
</nowiki></blockquote>

And lastly, include a simple 1-2 sentence definition of what the page is about. E.g. if the page is about "WidgeCo", start with something like:
<blockquote><nowiki>

'''<dfn>WidgeCo</dfn>''' is a ...

</nowiki></blockquote>
and complete that sentence.


You may also want to simply [[redirect]] a new page to an existing page.
* See [[redirect]] for how to do that.

== FAQ ==
=== May I copy paste from another site ===
Q: Is it ok if I mostly copy+paste a definition from the site of the product/company (e.g. WidgeCo in example above) that I'm creating a new page for?

A: Rather than copy/paste from their site, try to rephrase a definition so it sounds neutral, factual, and uses indieweb terminology when possible, which should then be <code><nowiki>[[ ]]</nowiki></code> linked.
