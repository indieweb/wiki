{{stub}}

If you want to '''<dfn>start a page</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb wiki, please read this page before doing so for reasons why, why not to, and how to do so â€” if you have any questions, please ask in the #meta [[chat channel]].

== Why ==
Create new pages that are [[relevant to the IndieWeb wiki]] for on topics for that you have a direct understanding of (preferably experience with) of the following reasons:
* There is a red link to the topic from an existing page
* The [[to-do]] list encourages creating the new page
* An existing page has its own '''To Do''' section (or subsection of its '''See Also''') that describes how the page should be split, or portions made into their own page(s)
* You are using some [[project]], [[library]], service, [[webhost]] for your own site and want to document it to encourage/help others do so
* You ask about a topic in an IndieWeb [[discuss]]ion channel and people encourage you to document it.
* Got other reasons? Discuss them in https://chat.indieweb.org/meta before adding them here.

== Why not ==
Please DO NOT create new pages that:
* Are not [[relevant to the IndieWeb wiki]]
* Already have a sufficient Wikipedia article

== How to ==
After joining the [[discuss|IndieWeb chat]] and familiarizing yourself with '''[[wikifying]]''', you can start a page on the wiki by either:

* Edit an existing page. Add a link to <code><nowiki>[[new-page]]</nowiki></code>, then save the page.
* Click the ''new-page'' link, then click "Edit"
'''or'''
* Type the URL of the desired page directly into the browser address bar, then click "Edit".

Then start by copy pasting the following:
<blockquote><nowiki>
{{stub}}
</nowiki></blockquote>

Then include a simple 1-2 sentence definition of what the page is about. E.g. if the page is about "Widget-Company", start with something like:
<blockquote><nowiki>
'''<dfn>Widget-Company</dfn>''' is a ...

</nowiki></blockquote>
and complete that sentence [[wikifying#Definitions_include_indieweb_relevance|including any indieweb relevance]].

If there is no indieweb relevance, then DO NOT create the page. 

If you need something to link to, link to a Wikipedia page instead of making a non-indieweb-relevant stub.

You may also want to [[redirect]] a new page to an existing page or section/heading therein.
* See [[redirect]] for how to do that.

For more on how and what to add to the wiki, see:
* '''[[wikifying]]'''

== Naming ==
Recognize that [[naming]] is hard.

Summary:
* '''Use short, plain words, using a space (" ") or dash ("-") between multiple words.'''

Warning:
* Please DO NOT use WikiWords (AKA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case CamelCase]) when naming pages because they are less discoverable, and worse for search results (both in site-search and web-search).
** E.g. the page [[2020/Pop-ups/GardenAndStream]] did NOT show up in page title results on a search for "garden". The repair was to move it to [[2020/Pop-ups/Garden-And-Stream]] which now DOES show up in a search for garden.

* Ask in [[discuss#meta]]

== FAQ ==
=== May I copy paste from another site ===
Q: Is it ok if I mostly copy+paste a definition from the site of the product/company (e.g. WidgeCo in example above) that I'm creating a new page for?

A: Rather than copy/paste from their site, try to rephrase a definition so it sounds neutral, factual, and uses indieweb terminology when possible, which should then be <code><nowiki>[[ ]]</nowiki></code> linked.
