[[Category:CMS]]

A '''<dfn>static site CMS</dfn>''' is a graphical interface for generating static files consumed by a [[static site generator]].

Static site [[CMS]]es provide buttons and forms that are often easier to use. They don't require direct access to files or remembering the file structures required by a static site generator. The resulting [[static site|static sites]] are typically managed separately from the [[CMS]] and can be viewed without the [[CMS]] running.
