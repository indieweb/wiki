[[Category:CMS]]

A '''<dfn>static site CMS</dfn>''' is a [[CMS]] that can be used to view, edit, and create static files used by a [[static site generator]]. Static site [[CMS]]es provide a graphical user interface that is easier to use than a [[CLI]] that is usually required for [[SSG]]s. 

== Why ==
A static site CMS provides a user interface to manage your posts and files without requiring direct access to files or remembering the file structures required by a static site generator. 

The resulting [[static site|static sites]] are typically managed separately from the [[CMS]] and can be viewed without the [[CMS]] running.
