{{stub}}

'''<dfn>streak</dfn>''' is the repeated performance of some action (like publishing a [[post]]) at some regular frequency (like daily), that is typically only recognized after some number of uninterrupted instances at that frequency, and used by some [[silo]]s as a form of [[gamification]] to encourage regular use of the silo or its apps, and could be used by an indieweb site to encourage personal positive behaviors.

== Why ==
You may want to consider creating and using a "streak" feature on your personal site to gamify a particular intentional positive behavior you would like to do more regularly. It can be one way to reinforce good habits.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
No explicit "streak" example yet, however see related examples in [[posting graph]] and [[calendar heatmap]].

Does your site explicitly display your streaks of particular activities like publishing a post in general, or a specific kind of post like a note or photo, or something else like an [[exercise]] post?

== Silo Examples ==
=== BeReal ===
[[BeReal]] (https://bere.al/) is a [[photo]] sharing [[silo]] that encourages taking and sharing a daily photo within 2 minutes of when the app notifies you, and starts counting your streak at 5 days in a row of posting photos.

BeReal uses a fire 🔥 icon to indicate a streak:

And puts a little 🔥 badge on your profile image (at least to yourself)

=== Duolingo ===
[[Duolingo]] (https://duolingo.com) has a daily language practice streak and promotes it under your personal records with a [[badge]] and number of days. It is also visible when your public profile is viewed. They offer some "streak freezes" which automatically apply if you miss a day, giving you a chance to maintain your streak without resetting to zero.

=== Garmin ===
Modern [[Garmin]] watches and the Garmin Connect app tell you your "steps count streak", of number of continuous days you have met your personal step count goal, both "Current Streak" and "Longest Streak".

== Brainstorming ==
=== Posts streak ===
{{t}}: I’m considering a little text indicator of a "posts streak" in my [[post footer]] like:
* <samp> 10:23 on 2025-01-05 (ttk.me t5_t1) using BBEdit. 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟢 5 day posting streak!</samp>
Or for more than 10, maybe use ❎ to indicate 10s, e.g.
* <samp> 10:23 on 2025-01-05 (ttk.me t5_t1) using BBEdit. ❎❎🟩🟩🟩🟩🟢 25 day posting streak!</samp>
And if necessary, maybe ✳️ for 100s lol and I'll worry about thousands if I ever get close to that.

Key:
* 🟢 — day of post being viewed, like a "you are here dot"
** could also be shown in the middle of a streak, e.g.
** <samp>20:48 on 2025-01-04 (ttk.me t5_s1) using BBEdit  🟩🟩🟩🟢🟩 in 5 day posting streak!</samp>
* 🟩 - a prior streak day
* ❎ - a prior streak 10 day block (the X like a Roman 10)
* ✳️ - a prior streak 100 day block (or should it be a month?)

Alternative: use calendar chunks of days.
* 🟢 — day of post being viewed, like a "you are here dot"
* 🟩 - a prior streak day
* ✅ - a prior streak whole week (Su-Sa? M-Su?)
* ❎ - a prior streak whole month (1-28/29/30/31)
* ✳️ - a prior streak whole year (1-365/366)

Alternative: use newcal chunks of days.
* 🟢 — day of post being viewed, like a "you are here dot"
* 🟩 - a prior streak day
* ✅ - a prior streak whole week (M-Sa, 5 days)
* ❇️ - a prior streak whole bim (1-61)
* ✳️ - a prior streak whole year (1-365/366)

Should the individual graphic emoji indicator blocks be hyperlinks?
