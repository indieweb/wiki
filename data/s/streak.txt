{{stub}}

'''<dfn>streak</dfn>''' is the repeated performance of some action (like publishing a [[post]]) at some regular frequency (like daily), that is typically only recognized after some number of uninterrupted instances at that frequency, and used by some [[silo]]s as a form of [[gamification]] to encourage regular use of the silo or its apps, and could be used by an indieweb site to encourage personal positive behaviors.

== Silo Examples ==
[https://duolingo.com Duolingo] has a daily language practice streak and promotes it under your personal records with a [[badge]] and number of days. It is also visible when your public profile is viewed. They offer some "streak freezes" which automatically apply if you miss a day, giving you a chance to maintain your streak without resetting to zero.
