{{stub}}

'''<dfn>streak</dfn>''' is the repeated performance of some action (like publishing a [[post]]) at some regular frequency (like daily), that is typically only recognized after some number of uninterrupted instances at that frequency, and used by some [[silo]]s as a form of [[gamification]] to encourage regular use of the silo or its apps, and could be used by an indieweb site to encourage personal positive behaviors.

* Silo example: [[BeReal]] is a [[photo]] sharing [[silo]] that encourages taking and sharing a daily photo within 2 minutes of when the app notifies you, and starts counting your streak at 5 days in a row of posting photos.
