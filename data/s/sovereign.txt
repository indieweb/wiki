[https://github.com/al3x/sovereign Sovereign] is a series of Ansible playbook scripts that administer a server. Established by [https://al3x.net Alex Payne], Sovereign has allowed me to setup a VPS running on Linode with the following features:

* Email server
* Calendar
* Contacts
* [http://owncloud.org OwnCloud] (Dropbox equivalent)
* [http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC IRC Bouncer]
* [http://prosody.im Jabber Server]

HTTPS comes by default.

I have found the project extremely stable and relatively straightforward to setup, although unsurprisingly email was tricky to setup especially when authenticating oneself as the sender of email. Apart from that, it's been an interesting and rewarding journey.

While not strictly IndieWeb (some make the distinction between this being a personal cloud), I'm happy to be able to not rely on 3rd parties to organize and control my data.
