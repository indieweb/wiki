'''<dfn>Specifications</dfn>''' (or <dfn>standards</dfn>) are technical documentation for communicating between two or more [[implementations]] in an interoperable way; for the indieweb in particular, standards help reach greater levels [[IndieMark]] user functionality to publish, express meaning, notify, subscribe, and many other user actions.

== IndieWeb Specifications ==
The following specifications are used for dependable interoperability by the IndieWebCamp community.

Broadly implemented: These standards are interoperably implemented by the overwhelming majority of indieweb software, services, and websites:
* [[IndieAuth]] (W3C Note)
* [[microformats2]]
** [[h-card]]
** [[h-entry]]
** [[h-feed]]
* [[Micropub]] (W3C Recommendation)
* [[rel-me]]
* [[Webmention]] (W3C Recommendation)
* [[WebSub]] (W3C Recommendation)

Numerous implementations: These standards have several implementations that interoperate, enough to consider the specifications fairly stable:
* [[authorship]]
* [[h-cite]]
* [[h-event]]

Being implemented / in development: These standards are undergoing active development and evolution as they are being implemented, tested in actual products with users, and then iterated for improvement:
* [[fragmentions]]
* [[Microsub]]
* [[original-post-discovery]]
* [[post-type-discovery]] (W3C Note)
* [[salmentions]]
* [[vouch]]

Stable with some support: These standards are stable (few or no changes in quite some time), yet only have some support, or are only supported by publishers:
* [[XFN]] (beyond rel=me) - many sites publish, no known consuming applications

Per IndieWebCamp [[principles]], microformats specifications are (re-)used heavily as essential simple building block extensions to HTML.

== Specs to iterate on ==
Here are specs we should iterate on for more formal publishing / announcing saying they're "done" enough etc. In rough order of simpler / shorter first (all of these should normatively reference [[microformats]] and IndieWeb specs as needed).
* [[post-type-discovery]] - AKA implied post type - see [[posts]] for a start on this.
** +1 {{kartik}} (useful for me for [[comments-presentation]] and other [[responses]])
* [[authorship]]
** +1 {{kartik}} (useful to discover author of a [[response]])
* [[original-post-discovery]]
** +1 {{snarfed}}. (When [[u-syndication]] links exist, or for a single known user, this is easy. Otherwise, interpreting backlinks is currently difficult and problematic.)
* [[indie-post-discovery]] - see and expand from [[original-post-discovery]], and then incorporate [[PESOS]] scenarios as well
* [[fragmentions]]
** +1 {{kartik}}
* [[post streams]] - simple minimal post-centric HTML-based approach to [[ActivityStreams]]
** reference [[h-entry]] and add proposed properties necessary for IndieWeb use-cases e.g. [[u-tag-of]] etc.
* [[Vouch]]
* [[IndieAuth]]
** +0 {{kartik}} (not using it a lot yet, but surely in the future.)
* [[syndication-brainstorming#Syndicate_by_Reference|syndicate by reference]]
** +1 {{snarfed}} ([[Bridgy]] has done this for a long time; [[IndieNews]] is migrating to it)
* [[syndication-brainstorming#Syndicate_by_Content|syndicate by content]]
* [[Private Webmention]]
* ...

== Other specifications ==
There are other specifications that even though various IndieWeb implementations / sites may support, they're not necessary for web independence, and thus omitted here.

To keep things especially simpler for authors and publishers, the indieweb does not depend on any specifications which require the author to duplicate (e.g. [[DRY]] violate) their content on additional URLs (e.g. [[sidefile-antipattern]]).

** "This is going to seem like a joke but it's not: in ~1978, there was a minor crisis around connecting the various networks (ARPA, CYCLADES, etc) into an "inter-network environment", aka the internet. Some of the discussions seems similar to our discussion of interoperability between content types in ActivityPub networks. I think it would behoove fediverse nerds to read up on this stuff.1978 paper summarizing the issue (PDF):  https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien20.pdf" [https://friend.camp/@darius @darius] June 11, 2019
