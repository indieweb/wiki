'''<dfn>slow web</dfn>''' is a movement based on deliberately designed web sites focused on more well user-paced experiences instead of real-time, reactive, or frantic experiences, and has principles similar to and compatible with IndieWeb [[principles]].

The slow web could be compared by analogy to, and was preceded by, the slow food movement. This ties in nicely with the idea of [[eat_what_you_cook|eating what you cook]] from an IndieWeb perspective.
