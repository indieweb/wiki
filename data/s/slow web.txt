'''<dfn>slow web</dfn>''' is a movement based on deliberately designed web sites focused on more well user-paced experiences instead of real-time, reactive, or frantic experiences, and has principles similar to and compatible with IndieWeb [[principles]].

The slow web could be compared by analogy to, and was preceded by, the slow food movement. This ties in nicely with the idea of [[eat_what_you_cook|eating what you cook]] from an IndieWeb perspective.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Garden first stream second ===
One defining aspect of many modern sites is the reverse-[[chronological timeline]] stream, typically dominating a [[homepage]] if not its only content.

This design focus (prioritizing) of latest rather than perhaps most relevant or curated content implicitly reinforces recency bias, and a sense of speed (how fresh is this content?) as more important than thoughtfulness and thus seems antithetical to a "slow web" design.

{{petermolnar}}’s post <cite>[https://petermolnar.net/journal/internet-emotional-core/index.html The internet that took over the Internet]</cite> cited Amy Hoy’s <cite>[https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/ How the Blog Broke the Web]</cite> which makes similar criticisms.

An alternative approach could be to make curated content the defining aspect of a home page, moving the [[stream]] to either a sidebar or section there of, or to a separate page entirely ("updates", "blog", etc.).

In the [[garden and stream]] metaphor, this would be equivalent to first focusing on the garden on your home page, and only second (if at all) presenting a stream. Preferring the slow growing & evolving garden over the rapid flow of the stream.

* {{t}}: rather than a requiring a return to handcrafted HTML for such "garden" content & design, I feel personal wiki pages are a possible approach: [[wiki-projects#Brainstorming]]
