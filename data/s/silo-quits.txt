<blockquote>In case it helps give others the strength, I deleted my Facebook account four days ago and my current rejoice-to-regret ratio is 100:1. Facebook has been an unfun wasteland for years. I deleted my 14-yr-old Facebook account. It‚Äôs nice to no longer live with the hypocrisy of giving my data to a company that I think does more harm than good, that‚Äôs irresponsible with said data, that‚Äôs so far up its own ass that it‚Äôs in over its head. All the photos though... (1/2) The hurdle to get over was the years of photos, mine and other people‚Äôs, that are stored there. FB let‚Äôs you download all your data, but if, like me, its just the photos you want: I used a Chrome extension called DownAlbum to quickly download entire FB albums. (2/2)</blockquote>

When you keep doing something after it stops giving you pleasure, that‚Äôs kind of rock bottom for an addict. ‚Ä¶ I just had a little moment of clarity where I‚Äôm like, You know what, if I want to get stuff done, I need to not constantly hit this thing for a news item or a joke or some praise, and then be suddenly sad when there‚Äôs hate and then hate and then hate.‚Äù</blockquote>

* 2015-03-31: <blockquote>A couple of months ago I decided to quit Facebook once and for all, and stop considering it an inevitability of my digital identity. Its business strategy had always creeped me out, even before the advent of frictionless sharing, which is something bad labeled as something good. Nothing I‚Äôve done throughout the years has ever fully succeeded in toning down the sources of creepiness, from the so-called Facebook envy to the feeling I have that even the smartest of my friends become shallow, babbling dummies the moment they open Facebook‚Äîwhich makes me certain that I too, in their eyes, must appear the same way, even more than my offline self does.</blockquote>

* 2014-09-09 {{Sebsel}} left Facebook (deactivating), after downloading the data-package they provide. Not everything seems to be in there, and it's certainly not easily parsed, but it's enough to not reactivate when in search for a memory. I did leave partly to get more time and space in my head, partly because I just did not want to have the feeling of being analysed all day.
