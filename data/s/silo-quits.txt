<blockquote>In case it helps give others the strength, I deleted my Facebook account four days ago and my current rejoice-to-regret ratio is 100:1. Facebook has been an unfun wasteland for years. I deleted my 14-yr-old Facebook account. It’s nice to no longer live with the hypocrisy of giving my data to a company that I think does more harm than good, that’s irresponsible with said data, that’s so far up its own ass that it’s in over its head. All the photos though... (1/2) The hurdle to get over was the years of photos, mine and other people’s, that are stored there. FB let’s you download all your data, but if, like me, its just the photos you want: I used a Chrome extension called DownAlbum to quickly download entire FB albums. (2/2)</blockquote>

* 2015-05-04: <blockquote>Whedon said, is that he chose to embrace his longstanding desire post–Age of Ultron to reclaim his personal life and creative spark — and that meant saying goodbye to Twitter.</blockquote><blockquote>Whedon laid out a portrait of the constant noise of Twitter and his complicated relationship to it to explain what eventually led him to leave.</blockquote><blockquote>“Twitter is an addictive little thing, and if it’s there, I gotta check it. When you keep doing something after it stops giving you pleasure, that’s kind of rock bottom for an addict. … I just had a little moment of clarity where I’m like, You know what, if I want to get stuff done, I need to not constantly hit this thing for a news item or a joke or some praise, and then be suddenly sad when there’s hate and then hate and then hate.”</blockquote>

* 2015-03-31: <blockquote>A couple of months ago I decided to quit Facebook once and for all, and stop considering it an inevitability of my digital identity. Its business strategy had always creeped me out, even before the advent of frictionless sharing, which is something bad labeled as something good. Nothing I’ve done throughout the years has ever fully succeeded in toning down the sources of creepiness, from the so-called Facebook envy to the feeling I have that even the smartest of my friends become shallow, babbling dummies the moment they open Facebook—which makes me certain that I too, in their eyes, must appear the same way, even more than my offline self does.</blockquote>

* 2014-09-09 {{Sebsel}} left Facebook (deactivating), after downloading the data-package they provide. Not everything seems to be in there, and it's certainly not easily parsed, but it's enough to not reactivate when in search for a memory. I did leave partly to get more time and space in my head, partly because I just did not want to have the feeling of being analysed all day.

<blockquote>we’re having dinner with Lisa Stone and Chris Carfi and Chris says Leo is the “Twitter quitter.” The reason Leo’s leaving Twitter is significant is because Leo kicked off the Twitter hype by talking about Twitter on his show, TWiT (This Week in Tech) about two weeks before SXSW.</blockquote>
