=== Centre for Innovation, Leiden University ===
2019-03-29 Closing all Facebook groups, Whatsapp groups, and Instagram accounts:
<blockquote>The Centre for Innovation of Leiden University has always strongly supported social or collaborative learning in online learning:  the interaction between learners facilitating learners, whether that is in discussion forums, peer review assignments or in our Facebook groups, contributes to a deeper understanding of subjects, and prepares learners to apply their knowledge.

However, the Centre for Innovation has a responsibility to our teachers, learners and volunteers, under GDPR and our own Privacy Policy. Based on this we conducted a review of different platforms that we made use of for collaborative, social learning and have decided to move away from those that do not allow us to meet our obligations and promises to those in our care.

Therefore we have decided to close all Facebook groups, Whatsapp groups and Instagram accounts currently under control of the Centre for Innovation, per the 29th of March 2019, and have adjusted our courses accordingly.

You can direct any questions or remarks in regards to this policy to MOOC@sea.leidenuniv.nl.

Kind Regards,

On behalf of Centre for Innovation, Leiden University,

On Twitter, the announcement ([https://web.archive.org/web/20190107094334/https:/twitter.com/RobertHabeck/status/1082199490013130752 archived]) triggered some immediate criticism for blaming social media for his own shortcomings; it was further questioned whether it is possible or appropriate for a politician to stay out of social media.

I deleted my 14-yr-old Facebook account. It’s nice to no longer live with the hypocrisy of giving my data to a company that I think does more harm than good, that’s irresponsible with said data, that’s so far up its own ass that it’s in over its head. All the photos though... (1/2) The hurdle to get over was the years of photos, mine and other people’s, that are stored there. FB let’s you download all your data, but if, like me, its just the photos you want: I used a Chrome extension called DownAlbum to quickly download entire FB albums. (2/2)</blockquote>

<blockquote>But his brief flirtation with the site left him "freaked out".

"I joined under a fake name and was sent a message from Facebook suggesting people I should befriend," Eisenberg explains.

"One of them was a girl my sister was friends with in high school. I don't know how they found her, no idea. I signed off right then."</blockquote>

Couldn’t you have called this Odeoer or something?”
* According to Scoble's post: 
<blockquote>we’re having dinner with Lisa Stone and Chris Carfi and Chris says Leo is the “Twitter quitter.” The reason Leo’s leaving Twitter is significant is because Leo kicked off the Twitter hype by talking about Twitter on his show, TWiT (This Week in Tech) about two weeks before SXSW.</blockquote>
