https://indieweb.org/silo-quits

<div class="p-summary">
'''<dfn>silo quits</dfn>''' are public statements by individuals announcing they have quit posting on or using various [[silos]] with no intention to return. Sometimes people take a temporary break, AKA "social media break" or [[soft quit]].
</div>

== Why ==
=== Why quit social media ===
There are numerous reasons to quit (or at least greatly reduce) use of [[social media]] silos, as fundamental as:
* Personal mental health
* Being deliberate with your time and attention
* Withholding support from systems that amplify misinformation, divisiveness, violence
For more, see:
* [[social_media#Criticism|Social media criticisms]]
* [[silo#Criticism|silo criticisms]]
Why to quit specific sites:
* [[Facebook#Criticism]]
* [[Twitter#Criticism]]
* [[Instagram#Criticism]]
Etc.
__TOC__
=== Why document silo quits ===
It is worth the time to publicly document quitting social media silos for many reasons:
* Show it is possible
* Set a good example
* Make it clear you are not alone for quitting or wanting to quit
* See individual perspectives on why they quit 


== Who ==
'''Want to be included in this growing list of people that have quit [[social media]] silos?'''
* [https://sso.indieweb.org/login?url=https%3A%2F%2Findieweb.org%2FMediaWiki%253Asilo-quits Sign-in] and add yourself, 
* or drop by the [[discuss|chat]] and ask to be added, someone will be happy to help you out!


'''This page is for documenting:'''
* '''Anyone in IndieWeb community''' — please only add yourself. If you see silo quit announcements by others in the community, please encourage them to add themselves if they like.
* '''Public figures''' — When "very public" people like celebrities, political figures, other "notable" individuals (see Wikipedia) make a public announcement of leaving or deleting a social media profile, feel free to add them.
* '''Anyone else who asks to be added''' and preferably makes a public silo-quit statement with permalink. 


'''Please do not:'''
* Please do not add people just because you see a silo-quit post on Twitter or elsewhere.
* Please do not ask people outside the community if they want to be added. E.g. people on Twitter that are declaring they are quitting Facebook etc.

'''Instead:'''
* If you choose to interact with someone publicly on Twitter, consider a positive invitation like:
*# Congratulate them for quitting (acknowledgment is meaningful, being seen is meaningful)
*# Let them know they’re not alone (solidarity is meaningful) and perhaps link to [[silo-quits]] in that context
*# Only then invite them to join the IndieWeb for alternatives and a supportive community. 
* Then they can read the invitation to add themselves on the page itself, instead of feeling pressured by a public invitation (by a possible/likely stranger) on Twitter that could come off sounding like a burdensome demand.

== Future silo quits ==
Silo quits announced far in advance, either based on a specific future date or a particular event that does not have a specific date associated with it yet.

== Unclear silo quits ==
These are folks that declared an intent to quit a silo but no evidence can be found that they actually did. If you can confirm either way with a public post or other verifiable evidence, please note those links in their entry and move it to the date they actually quit the silo or at least the year if you can determine it.

=== Mike Elgan, Journalist ===
2018-12-12 Elgan announced on his own website that on July 4th, 2019 (traditionally celebrated as Independence Day in the United States) he would be quitting and deleting Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. He wrote a long and succinct list of reasons why he's leaving in [https://elgan.com/blog/a-declaration-of-independence-from-facebook A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM FACEBOOK].

=== Centre for Innovation, Leiden University ===
2019-03-29 Closing all Facebook groups, Whatsapp groups, and Instagram accounts:
<blockquote>The Centre for Innovation of Leiden University has always strongly supported social or collaborative learning in online learning:  the interaction between learners facilitating learners, whether that is in discussion forums, peer review assignments or in our Facebook groups, contributes to a deeper understanding of subjects, and prepares learners to apply their knowledge.

However, the Centre for Innovation has a responsibility to our teachers, learners and volunteers, under GDPR and our own Privacy Policy. Based on this we conducted a review of different platforms that we made use of for collaborative, social learning and have decided to move away from those that do not allow us to meet our obligations and promises to those in our care.

Therefore we have decided to close all Facebook groups, Whatsapp groups and Instagram accounts currently under control of the Centre for Innovation, per the 29th of March 2019, and have adjusted our courses accordingly.

You can direct any questions or remarks in regards to this policy to MOOC@sea.leidenuniv.nl.

Kind Regards,

On behalf of Centre for Innovation, Leiden University,

On Twitter, the announcement ([https://web.archive.org/web/20190107094334/https:/twitter.com/RobertHabeck/status/1082199490013130752 archived]) triggered some immediate criticism for blaming social media for his own shortcomings; it was further questioned whether it is possible or appropriate for a politician to stay out of social media.

<blockquote>I decided that I would deactivate my Twitter account for the holidays. The holidays turned quickly turned into six months and here I am. I still have access to the Twitter profiles I wish to follow as most profiles are public, and thus I make a conscience effort to check the streams of particular folks (mostly journalists and news publications) that I’m still interested in following. Unsurprisingly, removing myself from punching the Twitter icon and swimming in the often negative environment that the community perpetuates has been a net positive for my health. In a similar fashion, I don’t have Instagram installed on my phone anymore (my workaround here is I’ll occasionally install it and bulk upload a handful of files and then delete it). For Facebook, I actually inactivated that account in November as well, but surprisingly felt myself come back to it quicker for important information I would miss otherwise (my gym uses a private group for all communication).

<blockquote>But his brief flirtation with the site left him "freaked out".

"I joined under a fake name and was sent a message from Facebook suggesting people I should befriend," Eisenberg explains.
