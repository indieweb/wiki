{{stub}}

<blockquote>all stub articles are alike; all expanded articles may be expanded in their own way.</blockquote>

A '''<dfn>stub</dfn>''' is an article that is brand new or considered incomplete by the authors/contributors, based on opinion or arbitrary measure. Contributors are encouraged to expand these articles.

The [[Template:stub|stub template]] should be used to indicate an article is a stub.
