'''<dfn>standards</dfn>''' are for communicating between two or more implementations in an interoperable way; on the IndieWeb, we use a set of building blocks standards to publish, express meaning, notify, subscribe as necessary by each [[project]].

Alphabetical list of building blocks standards widely used (by multiple projects) to interoperate on the indieweb:
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[microformats2]]
** [[h-card]]
** [[h-entry]]
** [[h-event]]
* [[Micropub]]
* [[Microsub]]
* [[Webmention]]
* [[WebSub]]
* [[XFN]]
* ...
