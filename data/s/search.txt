'''<dfn>search</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb refers to being able to search your personal site for your own content. Personal site searchability is a requirement for [[IndieMark]] Level 1.

== Why ==
Why should your site be searchable? 
* You want your independently created and owned content to be found and preferably above and beyond content on [[silos]].

Why should your site have a search UI?
* Convenient indieweb site search is a very commonly requested feature by readers / users of indieweb sites. 
* They don't want to have to think to go to Google (and take the extra steps) to search your site. 
* Make it easy for your friends that read your site to find stuff there by having a simple search box in the top right of every page (common UI convention) that allows the user to type something in and perform a search on your site. You can of course use 3rd party search engine to do this, even returning results directly from them. E.g. using a Google search box on your site.
* Website visitors can find exactly what they are looking for without having to search through pages of feeds or archives.
__TOC__

== Why Not ==
There are sometimes reasons you don't want a particular page or section of your site to not be indexed for searching. E.g.

* Private / private by obscurity URLs
* Dynamic aggregations, e.g. [[tag]] aggregation pages, [[archives]] (by date etc.), because you'd rather that just the post permalinks themselves get indexed to reduce noise in search results.

== How ==
How to implement search on your site.

=== searchability - level 1 ===
Make sure your site is at least searchable (IndieMark search level 1). This means:
* '''allow robots to index'''. Permissive or no robots.txt. Either don't have /robots.txt (easiest), or if you have one, it MUST allow search engines to index public posts on your site.
* '''post content in HTML'''. Your post content MUST be in the visible HTML of the page retrieved from your post permalink. No depending on [[Javascript]] to render your post content - if you can't <kbd>curl</kbd> it, it's not on the web.
* '''site-specific searchability'''. Be able to use "site:yoursite.example.com search-term" in [[Google]] and other search engines (that support site-specific searches) directly to find and display your posts in search results.

=== search box - level 2 ===
Add a simple search box to your site using a static form that submits to a search engine to provide time ordered (most recent first) results! (IndieMark search level 2)

 E.g.<pre><nowiki>
<form class="search" action="http://www.google.com/search" method="get">
<input type="hidden" name="as_sitesearch" value="tantek.com"/>
<input type="hidden" name="tbs" value="sbd:1,cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/1970"/>
<input type="search" name="q"/>
<button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
</nowiki></pre>

And change '''tantek.com''' to your personal site name!  This HTML has been [[selfdogfood]] tested live since [http://tantek.com/2012/188/t1/real-time-most-recent-first-search-push-indieweb-falcon 2012-07-06].

Search form styling is left as an exercise for the creator.

=== site search with 3rd party backend - level 3 ===
Search where your site uses a 3rd party search service (e.g. Google), but still provides the results on your own domain. (IndieMark search level 3)

How to TBD.

==== Third Party Search Services ====
* [https://www.google.com/cse Google Custom Search Engine]

* [https://www.algolia.com/ Algolia]
* [https://swiftype.com/ Swiftype]
* [http://tapirgo.com/ Tapir]

=== site search with site backend - level 4 ===
Search where your site handles all the indexing and search queries. (IndieMark search level 4)

How to TBD.

=== client side search ===
has been suggested as possible level 5? Not really better than lvl 4, more an alternative solution, especially for [[static sites]].

How to TBD.

Start with: http://lunrjs.com/
I.e.:
* Background XHR your recent content storage files to the client
* Feed them in structured form to lunr.js to build an index
* Enhance your search box / form with JS to do it all clientside if you have a lunr.js search index available

== How To Avoid ==
For all the reasons above in '''[[#Why_Not|Why Not]]''', here's how to avoid having specific pages not be indexed:

Put this in the head of your page you don't want indexed:
<pre>
<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow" />
</pre>

This instructs the crawler to not add the page to it's index, but to follow links contained in it. If you don't want it to consider links either, change <code>follow</code> to <code>nofollow</code>.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb sites that have search interfaces.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has had a search interface on his site [http://tantek.com/ tantek.com] since [http://tantek.com/2012/188/t1/real-time-most-recent-first-search-push-indieweb-falcon 2012-07-06] which uses a simple static form that submits to Google search ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 2).

=== Aaron Parecki ===
From 2012-07 to 2016-01, {{aaronpk}} had a search interface on his site [http://aaronparecki.com/ aaronparecki.com] which used a simple static form that posted to to Google search scoped to the website and with query parameters that indicate to Google to return posts in reverse date order ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 2). 

Since 2016-08 there is a search interface which searches a local index of posts, returning the list of matching posts rendered in normal list format in reverse date order ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 4).

Since 2020-06 the local search has been expanded to include searching the contents of reposts and likes, as well as the authors of those posts. e.g. https://aaronparecki.com/search?q=tantek

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} has had a search interface on his site [http://werd.io/ werd.io] since (2013-06-20) which uses his own site's backend ([[MongoDB]] in particular). ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 4).

=== Barnaby Walters ===
{{barnabywalters}} added a simple static search form (based on Tantek‚Äôs code) to [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] on 2014-02-24 which submits to a site-scoped Google search ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 2).

Also experimenting with local search engine which indexes the archive of all the pages I‚Äôve linked to as well as [[mentions]] of my own pages using [[Elasticsearch]].

UI as of 2014-03-01, showing authorship information, page name, excerpt, URL:
http://waterpigs.co.uk/img/2014-03-01-indie-search-halsway.png

=== Dan Lyke ===

{{danlyke}} has had [http://www.flutterby.com/archives/comments/3477.html locally hosted search since March of 2001], and currently has a simple search which uses his PostgreSQL back-end text indexes, and does some ordering of search results based on phrases, and "+" and "-" to require and exclude. ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 4).

Since I'm scanning various other sites for inbound links, I'd like to, at some point, index those other sites as well for additional search options.

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} has a search box on his site since [https://github.com/dissolve/postly/commit/ca8f9718a191359e525ab7d70eff538bda463f05 2014-09-30] which simply submits to Google search ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 2) ordered by most recent post.

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} previously had local search backed by Postgres full text matching (@@ operator) on 2015-01-16. Posts were presented as a standard h-feed, but I'd wanted to style them more like "search results" (and have more results per page) in the future.

In 2016-01, I converted my site to [[Known]], which uses MySQL full text search by default.

=== Christian Weiske ===
[[File:phinde_search_indieweb.png|300px|thumb|right]]
{{cweiske}} wrote his own generic search engine ''phinde'' that powers his blog search since 2016-02-05. The search engine is running on http://search.cweiske.de/ and supports site-specific search.
Indie search level 4.

''phinde'' supports faceted browsing on tags, domain, language and file type. It indexes not only the blog but all linked URLs.
Crawling, indexing and the HTML frontend are written in PHP, data storage and searching is done in ElasticSearch.

The search form is available on the [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/ blog index] and [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/tag/indieweb tag index] pages, as well on [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/gimp-remove-watermark-lines.htm single blog posts].

''phinde'' is also used for indieweb chat log search at https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} added local search to gregorlove.com for articles and notes on 2016-06-05 ([[indiemark#search|IndieMark search]] level 4).

* As of 2017-04-21, the search form has been moved to only appear at https://gregorlove.com/search. This page is linked from the footer of each page. I moved it in part because page footers were looking cluttered, and my usage of search is relatively infrequent. My current thinking is that it's fine to have it only on the /search URL.
** Previously: The search form is the bottom of each page and has fields for filtering by before/after date.
* Uses the [[ProcessWire]] API to search. Defaults to full-text queries, but uses like queries for shorter text.

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} has re-enabled search on his static [[Hugo]] site since [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/05/01/reenable-static-search/ 2019-05-01]

=== Murray (theAdhocracy) ===
{{murray}} uses Algolia to power search on his static [[Gatsby]] site since [https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/adding-search-refining-frontend 2020-05-09]

=== capjamesg ===

{{jamesgoca}} has built a custom search engine using Python Flask and sqlite3 for his blog. The search engine is composed of a crawler which crawles and processes all posts and images into an index and a web server that lets you query the index.

The search engine supports two types of pages:

* Regular pages (blog posts, the homepage, and all other html pages on my site)
* Images

Pages marked as noindex are not added to the index, which currently includes the webmentions I have sent and the 404 page on my site.

The search engine has been live at https://search.jamesg.blog since 07-2021.

=== The Doctor ===
[[User:Drwho.virtadpt.net|Drwho.virtadpt.net]] has finally gotten around to adding a 'real' search engine to their website using [https://yacy.net/ their favorite general purpose search engine] software.  The search engine went online on 26 July 2021 on a separate server they control.  The entire site was crawled to bootstrap the index and then the [https://drwho.virtadpt.net/rss/feed.xml RSS feed] was added to the YaCy scheduler to pull new posts and pages into the indexer.

A [https://drwho.virtadpt.net/archive/2021-08-26/updating-the-search-function-of-my-website/ blog post] that describes how it was done and integrated into their [[Pelican|static website]] was posted as part of the ''#libreops'' movement in the Fediverse.

== Design ==
If in doubt: copy Google (when it was still searching for relevant keywords, and was without the first page of ads)

=== Search UI ===
To start with, no need for anything more than a single-line text box and ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù button ‚Äî keep things focused.

=== Indexing ===
Due to widespread use of [[microformats]] on the indieweb, each page being indexed is rich in semantics which can be indexed e.g. explicit name, publication datetime [[authorship]] information, relations like [[in-reply-to]], representative image, etc.

Some properties can be faked if microformats markup isn‚Äôt present:
* '''name''' can be substituted with the contents of the <code>title</code> element

Many semantics similar to microformats ones can be found in invisible metadata like OGP meta elements ‚Äî whether or not it can be trusted or gives a better search experience requires further experimentation.

You may choose to use other structured data formats for indexing if your website supports them. For instance, you may choose to use JSON-LD, a type of linked structured data, in your indexing if your site is rich in JSON-LD syntax.

Structured data makes it much easier for you to index pages since you can rely on your implementation of a structured data standard when indexing information. For instance, using microformats means you could get any category on a page by looking for the p-category property. Finding a category without structured data present would be much more difficult.

To get the best results a plaintext representation of each page should be indexed. In lieu of a HTML to Plaintext algorithm, some steps to follow include:
* Remove the <code>head</code> element from the page
* Remove any other <code>script</code>, <code>style</code> elements from the page
* Replace embedded content (e.g. images, videos, audio) with it‚Äôs text-based accessible fallback e.g. <code>alt</code> attribute for images
* ‚Ä¶

You might opt not to index a plaintext representation of a page depending on what search features you want to allow. Indexing a whole page takes up significantly more space than indexing only meta descriptions, titles, and some information from a page, especially if you have a very large repository of content.

=== Result Display ===
Results should be displayed in order of relevance by default. Having the option to order search results by datetime might also be useful.

Each result should form a block with clear visual thingness separating it from other results. A click anywhere on the block should navigate immediately to the search result URL, which should be shown in it‚Äôs entirety at the bottom of the block.
* the only reason I can think of to ''not'' navigate immediately, i.e. navigate via an intermediate redirect is to check whether or not the page exists and show an archived copy instead. Perhaps that checking is better left to a browser extension which acts only on a 404 --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 09:51, 28 February 2014 (PST)

=== Ranking factors ===

You may choose to weigh a certain set of ranking factors to help improve "relevance" of your search engine. For instance, you may decide to weigh titles as more important than content in meta descriptions. Ranking factors to consider:

* Title tags
* Meta descriptions
* Image alt text (if you are adding image support to your search engine)
* Keywords (either identified by an algorithm or those specified in a meta tag)
* H2s
* H3s, H4s, H5s, and H6s.

Ranking factors are something you should consider if you have a large repository of content and want to maximize the chance that visitors find a result that meets their needs.

=== Advanced Filters ===

Google Search, and many other search engines like GitHub's search feature, support advanced filters that make it easy to find what you are looking for. On Google, these include:

* inurl:
* intitle:
* "specific term"
* AND
* OR

You can read more about advanced filters on Goggle in this article: https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/

You might also opt to add custom advanced filters based on your needs (i.e. a filter that returns posts published in a specific tag or category).

Some database full text search features, such as the SQLite full text search, already support filters like AND and OR. If you are using a database full text search feature, you should read their documentation to learn about what filters might already be available to you without implementing them directly.

=== Image search ===

It is possible to add image search support to a personal search engine. This is a nice feature to add if you have a lot of images on your site through which you want to search. Having this feature would make it easier for you to find what images you have used and perhaps find images to reuse in future posts or pages.

Image searches are most effective if you have alt text through which to search.

You can index results for image search as part of your regular text index. You should have a separate table in a database for image searching as you will need to keep track of different attributes. A basic image search index should keep track of:

* Image URL
* Image alt text (through which you will search)
* The title of the post associated with the image

These attributes will provide a solid foundation that will make it easy for you to find images based on keywords.

== Brainstorming ==

=== Sessions ===
Search related sessions at past IndieWebCamps:
* [[2012/Open Real Time Search Engine]]
* [[2018/Nuremberg/search]]

=== Faceted scoped search ===
Beyond raw searching of the contents of your site, it may also be useful to index and be able to search within:
* a time window (from/to dates/times)
* a geography (location proximity, within an area / polygon)
* person mentions

=== Site plus links search ===
Beyond searching just the contents of what you publish on your own indieweb site, it may be useful to *also* index:
* every page that you link to in your posts
And then provide results from those as well as your own site.

=== Site plus linked sites ===
Beyond searching just the contents of what you publish on your own indieweb site, it may be useful to *also* index:
* every '''site''' of pages that you link to in your posts, perhaps using [[PuSH]] discovery for those sites.
And then provide results from those as well as your own site.

=== Social search ===
Beyond searching just the contents of what you publish on your own indieweb site, it may be useful to *also* index:
* every '''indieweb site''' of any person you mention 
** in your posts
** sidebar
** friends lists
** etc. anywhere on your site.
* every site you follow in your indie [[reader]]
And then provide results from their sites as well as your own site.
