'''<dfn>silo sign-in</dfn>''' refers to all the delegated sign-in/login services offered by popular [[silos]] such as [[Facebook]] Connect, [[Sign in with Google]], and [[Sign in with Twitter]]. Instead of silo sign-in, you should use and support [[IndieAuth]].

== Silo Examples ==
=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] does not have explicit documentation for use purely as a delegated sign-in/login service, however there is this documentation for designing/building your own GitHub application that makes use of GitHub authentication:
* https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#authenticating-as-a-github-app

In addition, others have documented guides for using GitHub for delegated sign-in:
* [[GitLab]]: [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/github.html Use GitHub as an authentication]
* [https://plugins.miniorange.com/integrate-github-login-in-your-website-wordpress-oauth How to Integrate GitHub Login in your Website | WordPress | OAuth]

=== Google ===

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has [[Facebook Connect]]

=== Twitter ===
