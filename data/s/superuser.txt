{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>superuser</dfn>''' is a privileged user on a site (typically a [[silo]], like [[Foursquare]]) that has some admin abilities, sometimes different based on what "level" of superuser the user has been granted or has achieved.

== Why ==
Consider implementing superusers on your site so you can delegate some amount of admin or [[moderation]] to others.

== How ==
TBD. See existing examples below and add some brainstorming.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None currently

== Silo Examples ==
=== Foursquare ===
[[Foursquare]] / [[Swarm]] has super users, Level 1 through 3 (at least)
