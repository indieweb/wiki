==== IndieWeb Events ====

We welcome you to use the term indie web in a top level domain if you set up a website for a community event. Likewise for homebrew website clubs (hwc).

* Examples
** https://2019.indieweb.org/ - IndieWeb Event Registration
** https://indiewebcamp.nl/ - IndieWebCamps in the Netherlands
** https://hwclondon.co.uk/ - Homebrew Website Club meetups in London

==== IndieWeb Services ====

It is best to name a service by the problem is solves rather than using IndieWeb in your top level domain.

If you build a service to support the community we welcome the use of the word indie. see [[indie]] for numerous examples from pop culture on the history of the use of the word indie in other spaces.

* Examples 
** [https://telegraph.p3k.io/ Telegraph]- A service for sending webmentions.
** [https://IndiePay.me indiepayme]- a decentralized ledger for tracking payments
** [https://aperture.p3k.io/ Aperture]- a microsub social reader

* To-do: There's enough about indie* naming of things on this page and on [[2018/NYC/Organizers#projects_using_indieweb.tld_domains]] and [[indie]] itself that it's worth collecting all that in the [[indie naming]] page, and just leaving a summary behind here on [[style-guide]].
* IndieWeb isn't often seen as a verb, but it's been seen creatively in the wild: https://twitter.com/serdar/status/1504682044634279938, which uses it in the sense of backing up one's content and hosting it from one's own website; https://twitter.com/MichaelWDelaney/status/1504976136190713858
** "A real shame for what it’s now become, I’ve stopped uploading a while ago and stopped paying when they doubled the price - I wasn’t getting any value out of it. I need to #indieweb my photos though" [http://kilic.net/ @serdar] March 18, 2022
