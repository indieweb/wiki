A '''<dfn>style guide</dfn>''' is a document that describes writing style preferences or visual design elements that one may publish on their personal website.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} publishes a visual style guide since 2017-01-01:
* https://gregorlove.com/style-guide/

<blockquote>This style guide is for documenting the design elements used on gRegorLove.com.

I have found that the amount of CSS can easily grow out of control as new design elements are added. I am hoping to switch to a more style-guide-driven process to reduce that.

This style guide uses the same CSS as the rest of the site, so should reflect the current design elements with minimal maintenance.</blockquote>
