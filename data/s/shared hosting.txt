{{stub}}

'''<dfn>shared hosting</dfn>''' is a particular level of [[webhosting]] service that includes FTP access with at least [[PHP]] and/or [[Perl]] CGI on a server where a bunch of people have accounts that share the same filesystem, and the same [[Apache]]/[[nginx]] process(es). An [[SSH]] connection to these servers is often limited or absent, making it impossible to run different processes.

See [[webhosting#Shared_Hosting]] for examples and more details.

== Advantages ==
Despite apparent limitations of shared hosting (as compared to other [[web hosting]] options like a dedicated server), there are some advantages to developing and maintaining your indieweb site on shared hosting:

* '''good design constraint''' - "I kind of like it as a restriction, seeing what I can do with it" {{sebsel}}
* '''greater re-use potential''' - "like it as a restriction so that what I develop can be re-used by more people" {{t}}
* '''service use-case''' - "set up XRay on shared hosting to see if I could, and it turns out it works quite well there" {{aaronpk}}
* '''portability''' - "it's a good baseline for portability of your own stuff too!" {{t}}

== FAQ ==
=== How to know if on shared hosting ===
Q: How can you tell if your webhosting service is a shared hosting service?

A: If you can <kbd>ssh</kbd> into the server, try <kbd>ls /home/</kbd>. If you see an error message like: <blockquote>ls: cannot open directory /home/: Permission denied</blockquote> then you're likely on shared hosting service.
