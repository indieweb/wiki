'''<dfn>Single points of failure</dfn>''' (<abbr><dfn>SPOF</dfn></abbr>s) are aspects or parts of a system which, when they fail, cause crucial parts of (or the entire) system to fail; on the web, the most visible examples are [[silos]] and massive site outages when they all depend on a common provider like [[AWS]]. 

SPOFs are an important thing to take into account when designing software, or creating a protocol, or setting up a personal websites.

** "Some of the websites appearing to experience outages this morning:<br><br>-Amazon Web Services<br>-New York Times<br>-Reddit<br>-The U.K. government's website <br>-Spotify<br>-Twitch<br>-Twitter<br>-GitHub<br>-Us (hope you can read this article)<br><br>https://trib.al/W16KFK9" [http://www.businessweek.com @BW] June 8, 2021

== Silo Examples ==
Literally all the [[silo]]s — when their site goes down, all your stuff there is inaccessible.

=== Single external authentication providers ===
* Websites that only offer [[Twitter]] (or another silo) as an authentication provider will fail 100% of time to allow users access if Twitter (or that other silo) is down.

== Software ==
* All users on a hosted instance of [[Mastodon]] or [[Diaspora]] will lose all services if that instance goes down

== More Examples ==
* Websites on hosting providers, DNS providers or the like that go down will lose access to the Web.

== Articles ==
* 2021-03-27 Bloomberg: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-27/suez-ever-given-fiasco-shows-civilization-is-more-vulnerable-than-we-think Suez Shows Civilization Is More Vulnerable Than We Think] <blockquote><p>[...] In the strategy and military realm, such bottlenecks are also known as “choke points.” And we often don’t pay enough attention to them until something goes wrong. </p><p>Systems designers strive to avoid these '''single points of failure''', so that transport, energy and '''communication networks''' are able to withstand attacks or unexpected calamities.
