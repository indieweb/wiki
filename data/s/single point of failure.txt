'''<dfn>Single points of failure</dfn>''' (<abbr><dfn>SPOF</dfn></abbr>s) are aspects or parts of a system which, when they fail, cause crucial parts of (or the entire) system to fail. SPOFs are an important thing to take into account when designing software or creating a protocol.

== Examples ==
* [[silo]]s
* Websites that only offer [[Twitter]] as authentication provider will fail 100% of time to allow users access if Twitter is down
* All the downtime of services which depend on [[AWS]] when it goes down
* All IndieWeb sites which rely on [[Bridgy]] to [[backfeed]] and [[POSSE]], will not receive or send webmentions should Brid.gy be down
* All users on a hosted instance of [[Mastodon]] or [[Diaspora]] will lose all services if that instance goes down
* [[IFTTT]]
