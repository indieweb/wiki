{{stub}}

'''<dfn>single point of aaron</dfn>''' is when a relatively early IndieWeb technology is being developed and there haven't been enough implementations to create proper diversity causing an over reliance on one of {{aaronpk}}'s services in order for the technology to broadly. The goal is always to mitigate this by encouraging people to build more implementations of a given technology or to discover what might be causing a lack of implementations.
