{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>snarkinition</dfn>''' is a portmanteau of (and meaning both) snarky and definition, often used to start [[wikify]]ing a technology or piece of jargon which is not necessarily well regarded, sometimes as an implicit challenge to advocates to step-up and say [[why]] otherwise.

Snarkinitions may be more harmful (especially to newcomers) than helpful (e.g. in their small insider humor value).

== To Fix ==
Better to fix existing snarkinitions by providing neutral (similar in tone as Wikipedia NPOV) definitions, and move any actual criticism to an explicit "Criticisms" section, rewriting them in plain factual language, with citations for claims.

To fix:
* [[bitcoin]]
* [[blockchain]]
* [[decentralized]]
