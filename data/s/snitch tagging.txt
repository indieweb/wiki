{{stub}}

'''<dfn>snitch tagging</dfn>''' is a special case of explicitly person-mentioning someone in a [[reply]] to or [[quotation]] of a post which mentions (usually critically) that same someone more obliquely (like plain text or a nickname) as a way of notifying that person of the critique, either as a heads-up, or perhaps in agreement with the critique.
