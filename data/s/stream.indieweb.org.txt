== spam or misuse accounts ==
There are a small handful of Mastodon or Bluesky accounts that are either spamming the #indieweb hashtag, or overzealously using it for a post that happens to be posted on an indieweb site (and syndicated to Mastodon), but is not about anything actually indieweb related.

Until we have a mechanism to block these accounts from the stream hashtag feeds, we (as a community) must manually remove their spam from the chat archives on a daily basis.
* See: [[discuss_infrastructure#How-to_remove_spam]] for how to manually remove spam from our chat archives.
