'''<dfn>storycards</dfn>''' are the 'related articles' previews often shown at the bottom of pages by publishers. They usually consist of a [[featured]] image, a headline and link. Author and published date information may also be shown.

Representing them as a an [[h-feed]] or list of [[h-entry]] makes sense, as the elements map exactly; in fact this was the original use case for the RSS [[feed]], used to display headlines on the home page of Netscape.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
[[unmung]] can generate a storycard view from a h-feed eg [[http://www.unmung.com/storycard?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkartikprabhu.com%2F Kartik's]]

== Silo Examples ==
Discussed in [https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/657#issuecomment-148875503 AMP issues], which mentions the Guardian examples.
