=== US Democratic Candidate Debate 2015-11-14 ===
[[Twitter]] was a major sponsor of the US Democratic Presidential Candidate Debate on 2015-11-14.

The candidatesâ€™ podiums all had their Twitter @-names on them instead of their full names.

The television broadcast of the debate showed additional Twitter related information, charts of relative @-mention frequencies, recent #demdebate mentions.
