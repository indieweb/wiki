<span style="font-size: 1.8em; font-style: italic;">Where incredible journeys end</span>

'''<dfn>Site deaths</dfn>''' are when sites go offline, taking content and permalinks with them, and breaking the web accordingly. Site deaths are one of the big reasons [[why]] you should own your own identity and content on the web.

This is a chronology of content hosting sites that have died, removing millions (billions?) of permalinks from the web. This is specifically for content hosting sites which permitted end-user posting. Not random sites nor pure "app" sites where there's no loss of user data. If a game site goes down and takes down play history/scores, or if Gmail went away those would both represent '''loss of user data''' (though no public permalinks).

The tendency for big companies to shut down a service and delete all your things has now even been [https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1361 satirised by XKCD]. [https://medium.com/message/587479c215f4 Andy Baio talks through one example] from creation, to growth, acquisition, [[acquihire]], disillusionment, neglect, and shutdown.

**"Lots of information on AOL Hometown very important to people who put hard work into these efforts is being lost, possibly without notice." - David Dillard, "Meet the Googles" Visits the Grave Site of AOL Hometown to Ponder Its Past All to Short Life[27]
**"I was surprised to find that AOL just shut down their homepage service on Oct. 31st. There were many great websites created through that service that simply no longer exist." - Dr. Jitters, November 12, 2008[28]
**"I knew this was coming, I just didn't know the day. I tried, with the help of some great people, to get AOL to donate ficlets to a non-profit, with no luck. I asked them just to give it to me outright since I invented it and built it with the help of some spectacular developers and designers. All of this has gone nowhere. [...] I'm disappointed that AOL's turned its back on the community, although I guess I shouldn't be surprised." - Kevin Lawver, Ficlets Est Mort[29]
**"A terrible thing happened recently. You might have missed it. AOL Hometown, which itself was actually a combination of a bunch of previously acquired websites, shut down. [...] It's all fine and good, those readers who sneer and say 'you get what you pay for' and 'ha ha, losers'. But the fact is, these people were brought online and given a place for themselves. Like a turkey drawn with a child's hand or a collection of snow globes collected from a life well-lived, these sites were hand-made, done by real people, with no agenda or business plan or knowledge, exactly, of how everything under the webservers worked. They were paying for their accounts, make no mistake – this was often provided to them as a tool combined with their AOL accounts. Some were absorbed from other companies as AOL purchased them. Some of these websites had existed for a decade. [...] We're talking about terabytes, terabytes of data, of hundreds of thousands of man-hours of work, crafted by people, an anthropological bonanza and a critical part of online history, wiped out because someone had to show that they were cutting costs this quarter." - Jason Scott, Eviction, or the Coming Datapocalypse [http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1617]

=== Publish on silo.rip ===
* Create a MW template for listing shutdowns 
* Add h-event markup to the MW template, noting the date, company, and description of the shutdown. (maybe logo too somehow?)
* {{aaronpk}} can write a parser that takes the list of h-events and reformats them nicely to fit on silo.rip
