The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/wiki/socialig Social Web Interest Group]</dfn>''' was a [[W3C]] Interest Group that was chartered with documenting use-cases for the [[social web]], based on the outcome of the [[osfw3c]] workshop in 2013-08.

After it closed, further work was continued in the [[Social WG]], and eventually the [[Social CG]].
