A source map is a map of transpiled code back to its source code allowing for easier debugging, for example, if you were to transpile a TS project into JS, you may also generate .js.map files that map those JS files to the source TS files.

This would be helpful when you transpile or transform your source code as it lets web browsers know how to undo those operations for better logging and debugging of the code.
