'''<dfn>structured data</dfn>''' may be used to refer to computer science data structures in general, or in the context of the web, adding structure (often semantic) to HTML markup, like [[microformats]], most recently [[microformats2]] as an IndieWeb [[building block]].

== Historical ==
There have been past "structured data" efforts on the web, like the nearly eponymously named "Structured Blogging", a 2005-era attempt to structure blog posts using XML embedded in &lt;script&gt; tags inside HTML (AKA XML Data Islands) that invisibly duplicated the visible content from HTML.
