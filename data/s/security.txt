'''<dfn>security</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb may refer to security concerns regarding [[personal domain]]s, [[web hosting]], [[https]] setup, private data, identity etc. Nearly everything on the internet, including the web, and thus indie web, has security concerns.

== Why ==
You should make your personal site more secure so that in general you and others can trust it more.

== How to ==
See:
* [[CSP]]
* [[HTTPS]]
* [[sandbox]]

== Visibility ==
__TOC__
Services that require logins or act as [[authorization-endpoint|authorization servers]] should provide a way for users to see an audit trail of events relating to their account. For example:

=== GitHub Security History ===
[[GitHub]] provides a [https://github.com/settings/security page listing accesses to your account] with details such as from what device, OS, location, date of access:

=== Google Recent Activity ===
[[Google]] provides a [https://www.google.com/settings/security security recent activity log] with date, browser, OS used to access your account and other information:

== Breaches ==
Security breaches as reported by sites

=== 2014 ===
* 2014-04 [[Heartbleed]]
* 2014-02-15 [[Kickstarter]] https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/important-kickstarter-security-notice
* ...

== Reproducible problems ==

=== https http botches ===
Today, when standards like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security HSTS]
try to mitigate [[https]] to http degradation [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moxie_Marlinspike&redirect=no#Notable_research attacks], there's no reason to allow http at all. All http should redirect to https.
Examples of "willful degradation" in indie web related software and services:
* Webmentions to [[Known]] only work if you mention the http URL. This may encourage using unsafe links to [[Known]] (that shouldn't exist in the first place).
* [[webmention.io]] regards http and https as different URLs. Perhaps this is not a bug, because in a perfect world there ''wouldn't'' be any https.

== Web Hosting ==
Should you write about your [[web hosting]] setup?

In some regards yes, to help out other members of the community.

However from a security perspective, disclosing what web host you use, software, VPS, or how you implement your server configuration are potential security issues because every piece of information you give a potential attacker about your setup helps narrow the space of weaknesses to explore.

So, how do you share information without endangering yourself in that regard?

You decide you're not a worthy target, or you decide you'd rather share publicly in the hopes that friends will warn you about any flaws before an attacker exploits them.

== Dealing with unknown problems ==
Per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design :
* Peer review existing protocols and [https://dubiousdod.org/indie/2014/11/i-always-think-of-this-classic-http-homakov-blogspot implementations].
* Look for docs, advice, potential peer-reviewers at communities like [https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/liberationtech MIT's Liberationtech mailing list] (''any other ideas?'').
* Think in advance about security implications of features like private messages.
* Always prefer existing and ''popular'' (i.e. constantly peer reviewed) technology to reinventing crypto.
* Eventually - prepare guidelines for site owners and developers on the Wiki (similar to [https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/keeping-your-data-safe Eff's SSD]).
