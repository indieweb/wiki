A '''<dfn>shopping cart</dfn>''' is a mechanism for allowing people to buy specific goods and services, often with invoicing and shipping.

== Standalone shopping pages ==

These silos provide a full website with product categorization and often a larger marketplace for product discovery. They usually charge a per-item commission and/or listing fee, with different monthly fees allowing for additional services (e.g. more control over variations, using your own domain name, etc.).

== Embeddable widgets ==

These providers allow you to embed a cart interface onto a page under your control.

=== Product-level embeds ===

This mechanism gives more control over the layout and allows providing your own markup, including <code>[[h-product]]</code>.

* [https://snipcart.com Snipcart]: allows you to place purchase buttons on your site, said buttons generating inventory items on-the-fly and allowing your own layout
* [https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/web/ Paypal web payments API]: provides a cart API as part of it
* [https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout Stripe Checkout]

=== Full-shop embeds ===

This mechanism embeds the shop itself onto your page, which generally limits the customization and the markup that you can generate. It's also generally bad for [[SEO]] as search engines are unable to parse your product information.

* [https://ecwid.com Ecwid]: embeds a full store interface into a DOM element on your site

== Self-hostable options ==

These allow you to host your own cart service on your own server; payments are still naturally outsourced to a third-party payments provider. Generally these are for building entire web presences for a large enterprise and are the IndieWeb equivalent of using an erupting volcano to roast a turkey.

* [https://opencart.com OpenCart]: open source
* [https://prestashop.com PrestaShop]: open source, but the payments modules are mostly proprietary and expensive

== Rolling your own ==

Many of the payments providers provide APIs that simplify the order management/tracking/payments aspect; for example:

* [https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/what-it-does Square orders API]
* [https://developer.paypal.com/docs/commerce-platform/ PayPal commerce platform]
* [https://stripe.com/docs/payments#build-your-own Stripe payments]
