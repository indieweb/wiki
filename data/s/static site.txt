A '''<dfn>static site</dfn>''' is a website that is served by a web server directly from the file system.

== Why ==
A static site is much simpler to keep up and running than a dynamic website that executes custom code for every page that is requested, or worse, [[database-antipattern|depends on a database]] which itself may independently go down.

== Sending Webmentions ==
The services below can be used to send [[Webmentions]] for a static website.

=== Telegraph ===
[[Telegraph]] is an open source project and hosted service for sending [[Webmentions]] and [[pingbacks]]. You can use it to send mentions to all links on a page, or send a webmention with specific source and target.

=== stapibas ===
[[stapibas]] is an application that sends linkbacks for all links in an atom feed, and receive incoming linkbacks.

=== lazymention ===
[[lazymention]] is a server that, when pinged, will crawl an h-feed and send Webmentions for any new content it sees. There may be a hosted version eventually, but {{strugee}} has to work out some security things first.

=== github-to-webmention ===
[https://github.com/keithjgrant/github-to-webmention github-to-webmention] is a self-hostable server that can receives a GitHub webhook notifying it of changes to a static site. It then finds links in new posts and sends webmentions to those targets from the new page.

== Receiving Webmentions ==
The services and software below can be used to receive webmentions for a static website.

=== webmention.herokuapp.com ===
{{main|webmention.herokuapp.com}}
[https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com] is an open-source project and hosted service for receiving [[webmentions]] for registered sites and allowing those to be displayed through javascript.

=== webmention.io ===
{{main|webmention.io}}
[http://webmention.io webmention.io] is an open-source project and hosted service for receiving [[webmentions]] and [[pingbacks]] on behalf of your indieweb site.

=== Log HTTP POST data ===
If you're self-hosting and control the web server you can have it log HTTP POST requests sent to your webmention endpoint URL in a log file. Then you look at the log file with your a text editor and respond manually, or script it, or whatever you like. An example of how to do this with nginx is at 
"A static, manual system for *receiving* webmentions (and pingback) with nginx" http://superkuh.com/blog/2020-01-10-1.html

=== go-jamming ===
[[go-jamming]] is a [[Jamstack]]/[[Webmention]] microservice written by {{woutergroeneveld}} and the [https://github.com/wgroeneveld/go-jamming code is available on GitHub]. He wrote it originally  for use on his [[Hugo]] website and describes it at [https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/05/beyond-webmention-io/ Host your own webmention receiver]. Go-jamming makes it possible to service multiple websites with one installation.


== Micropub ==
Static sites that wish to support [[Micropub]] will need to run a Micropub endpoint somewhere that has access to the file storage used by the static site or static site generator.

* [[nanopub]] - for [[Hugo]]
* [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github webpage-micropub-to-github] - for Jekyll sites hosted on GitHub Pages
* [[Sitewriter]] - for anything that builds from a GitHub repository
* {{jamietanna}}'s Micropub endpoint commits to the GitLab API and rebuilds his site https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/08/26/setting-up-micropub/
* [[Indiekit]] - has presets for [[Jekyll]] and [[Hugo]] and supports several options for repository hosting

There was a session at [[2020/London]] on [[2020/London/staticmicropub|Static Websites and Micropub]] which may have some additional brainstorming ideas as well.
