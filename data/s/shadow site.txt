{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>shadow site</dfn>''' is a either a copy or a simulacra of an actual independent web site, at a seemingly independent domain, setup by a third party hoping to intercept searches for the original site, and insert their own business model (like a food delivery service) that bypasses or charges more than the original site. 

E.g. https://blog.rankingcoach.com/en/lieferando-makes-shadow-sites-of-listed-restaurants.
