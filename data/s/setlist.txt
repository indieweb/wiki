A '''<dfn>setlist</dfn>''' or <dfn>set list</dfn> is an ordered list of songs, jokes, stories and other elements an artist intends to present during a specific performance. Some fans enjoy collecting these on their websites for performances they've attended along with documenting the [[venue]]/[[checkins]], and providing [[photos]], [[article|essays]], [[review]]s, and (bootleg) [[audio]].
