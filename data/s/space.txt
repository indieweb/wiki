{{stub}}

'''<dfn>space</dfn>''' is typically used in IndieWeb contexts to refer to presentational blank space(s) on web pages, and the space between words and lines of text, including line-breaks, sometimes used to format [[note]] posts, like to indent lines, or with specific meaning like text lists without markup.

Sometimes the terms "whitespace" (e.g. CSS 'white-space' property) or "negative space" are used for specific instances or discussions.
