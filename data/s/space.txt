{{stub}}

'''<dfn>space</dfn>''' (also <dfn>negative space</dfn> or <dfn>empty space</dfn>) is typically used in IndieWeb contexts to refer to presentational blank space(s) on web pages, and the space between words and lines of text, including line-breaks, sometimes used to format [[note]] posts, like to indent lines, or with specific meaning like text lists without markup.

If you need to use a term in an ambiguous context and want to specifically refer to presentational or layout empty spaces, please use either "empty space" or "negative space", and avoid using "white space" (unless you literally have to refer to the CSS 'white-space' property).
