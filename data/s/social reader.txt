A '''<dfn>social reader</dfn>''' is a modern interactive [[reader]] that allows you to directly respond to posts (with a [[like]], [[comment]], etc) right there inline with posts as you read them (as people do in [[social media]]), in contrast to legacy [[feed reader]]s which were one-way read-only experiences and provided no mechanisms to interact with or respond to posts.

== Why ==
* Watch the [[2020/Austin/social-readers|Social Readers]] keynote by {{aaronpk}}

== Introduction ==
Social readers provide the interactivity everyone now expects from [[social media]], yet built with the open standards [[Microsub]] and [[Micropub]]!
* ðŸ“ƒ Read {{aaronpk}}'s '''[https://aaronparecki.com/2018/04/20/46/indieweb-reader-my-new-home-on-the-internet An IndieWeb reader: My new home on the internet]''' for an introduction

=== Indigenous ===
[[Indigenous|<img src="https://indieweb.org/images/2/2a/indigenous-0.3-reader.png" style="max-width:25%;float:left" alt="iOS Indigenous screenshot." /><img src="https://realize.be/indigenous-screenshots/indigenous_channel_list.jpg" style="max-width:25%;float:left"><div style="clear:left">&nbsp;</div>]]

{{eddiehinkle.com}} and {{realize.be}} are working on [[Indigenous]], which are native iOS and Android reader apps. It is based on [[Microsub]] and [[Micropub]]. It allows a user to login using IndieAuth, and if a [[Microsub]] endpoint is found on the user's primary identity site, a reader interface is shown when the app is opened. It includes the following features:
* See a list of channels
* Preview all posts in a channel, with the option to send a [[reply]] via [[Micropub]] or view the original post at the permalink.

=== Monocle ===
[[Monocle|<img src="https://indieweb.org/images/5/53/monocle-timeline-view.png" style="max-width:59%;float:left;margin-right:1%" alt="Monocle desktop screenshot of timeline view." /><img src="https://indieweb.org/images/thumb/d/d2/monocle-mobile-view.png/440px-monocle-mobile-view.png" style="max-width:19%;float:left;margin-right:1%"><img src="https://indieweb.org/images/thumb/8/8e/monocle-mobile-stream.png/440px-monocle-mobile-stream.png" style="max-width:19%;float:left"><div style="clear:left">&nbsp;</div>]]
[[Monocle]] is a web-based reader (desktop and mobile, see above) that is a generic [[Microsub]] client and can be used with any [[Microsub]] server, written by {{aaronpk}}.

=== Together Project ===
{{grantcodes}} and {{cleverdevil}} are working on the [[Together]] project, which is an open source reader based upon [[Microsub]] and [[Micropub]]. Together attempts to provide an integrated experience that "brings your IndieWeb experience together," including:
* Preview and subscribe to websites, arranging them into "channels."
* Create interactions including Like, Repost, and Reply, publishing those interactions to your website via [[Micropub]].
* Different layouts to view posts as a timeline, gallery, map or classic 2 pane reader.

Here are a few screenshots of Together as of November 20th, 2018:

* Brainstorming: The UI of [[Quill.chat]] has a lot of interesting features for attempting to increase focus, that social readers could likely benefit from (see screenshots inside): https://web.archive.org/web/20211207151441/https://quill.chat/
