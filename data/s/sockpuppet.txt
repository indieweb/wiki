'''<dfn>sockpuppet</dfn>''' is a fictitious online identity (usually a [[pseudonym]]) created as a form of deception for many possible use-cases, such as inflating interesting in a topic or project, publicly providing strawman arguments that the same person can openly refute, artificially generating controversy that the actual person can then peaceably resolve, etc. Example: https://web3isgoinggreat.com/single/ian-macalinao-pseudonyms.
