'''<dfn>static maps</dfn>''' are a way to show a map as an image on a web page without requiring a javascript library.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses a PHP [https://github.com/aaronpk/Static-Maps-API-PHP Static Maps library] to display static maps on his event posts as well as on walk/run/bike/drive posts when shown in the list view.

{{jeena}} uses the the [http://staticmap.openstreetmap.de/ OSM static map service] to display static maps under pictures with geo data to show where they were taken. He also caches every picture to go easy on the free service.

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} uses a PHP library [https://github.com/dfacts/staticmaplite staticMapLite] — with Stadia's map tile service hosting Stamen's Toner tiles — to display static maps on his [[checkin]] posts. staticMapLite caches tile images once created.
