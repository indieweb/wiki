=== Digital greenwashing ===
From https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24269071: <blockquote><p>Appropriate all the good values and ideas from https://indieweb.org/, re-heat it add some feel-good word salad and we have this "Small Web".</p><p>Yes, by all means let's get back to a more decentralized and distributed web. But providing a service where you are still hosting your site on someone else's servers and on someone else's domain and calling for values is just '''digital green-washing'''.</p></blockquote>'''Emphasis''' added.
