A '''<dfn>sparkline</dfn>''' is a small, simple, data-dense graphic with typographic resolution that is shown inline and in-context with relevant text.

If you are want to set up the <code><nowiki>{{yourname}}</nowiki></code> template with your name, photo, and link for use on wiki pages, see:
* '''[[Tutorial-set-up-your-personal-wiki-template|Tutorial: Set up your personal wiki template]]'''

The term was coined by Edward Tufte, and inspired by [http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00004p Galileo's drawings of the shape of Saturn inline] with his writings about them.

Contrary to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline Wikipedia definition], sparklines are not limited to graphs, graphs are simply the most common use of sparklines (and "line graph" is unfortunately somewhat implied by the word "line" in the name). Rather, sparkline includes the kinds of graphics that inspired them in the first place, e.g. see Tufte's notes about Galileo's drawings of the shape of Saturn inline with text:

=== Previous Examples ===
==== capjamesg ====
{{capjamesg}} used sparklines ([https://jamesg.blog/2022/12/30/mediawiki-sparkline/ from 2022-12-30] to ~2024) to display 90 day trends of:

* The number of blog posts he has written;
* The number of contributions he has made to the IndieWeb wiki, and;
* The number of blog posts he has written about computer vision (professionally).

Sparklines are displayed on James' homepage and on his blog post category pages.

Here is an example of the sparklines displayed on James' homepage.

== Resources ==
=== WordPress ===
There are several plugins for adding sparklines to WordPress websites including:
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitysparks/ Activity Sparks] plugin by Greg Jackson adds some configurable functionality for adding sparklines to [[WordPress]] sites including for posts and comments as well as for tracking [[categories]]/[[tags]].
*  [https://dentedreality.com.au/projects/wp-sparkplug/ Sparkplug] by [https://dentedreality.com.au/ Beau Lebens] has similarity to the Activity Sparks plugin (above), but with a slightly older and different implementation.

=== Sparks, a typeface ===
[https://github.com/aftertheflood/sparks Sparks] is a typeface for creating sparklines in text without code. Functionality and details described in more detail at: [https://aftertheflood.com/projects/sparks/ The world’s first code-free sparkline typeface].
