For adding a <nowiki>{{username}}</nowiki> "sparkline" template for with your icon (text sized) and name for adding a link to yourself to wiki pages, see:
* '''[[wikifying#Step_Four:_Add_a_sparkline|wikify: Add a sparkline]]''' (for your username)

The term was coined by Edward Tufte, and inspired by [http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00004p Galileo's drawings of the shape of Saturn inline] with his writings about them.

Rather, sparkline includes the kinds of graphics that inspired them in the first place, e.g. see Tufte's notes about Galileo's drawings of the shape of Saturn inline with text:

* The number of blog posts he has written;
* The number of contributions he has made to the IndieWeb wiki, and;

Sparklines are displayed on James' homepage and on his blog post category pages.

Here is an example of the sparklines displayed on James' homepage.
