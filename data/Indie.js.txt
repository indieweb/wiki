'''<dfn>Indie.js</dfn>''' is an open-source IndieWeb [[project]] that was officially started [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-18/line/1405668719000 on July 18th, 2014] but has powered [https://mowens.com mowens.com] since July 8th, 2014.

== Goals & Model ==

[http://indiejs.com Indie.js] is more than just a homerolled IndieWeb server. Its goal is to provide a turnkey IndieWeb framework that helps people [[own-your-data]] and have a better IndieWeb experience. The expectation is that Indie.js will have both a self-hosted and a hosted version.

== Development ==

[[User:mowens.com|Michael Owens]] is the sole developer of Indie.js at the present time. Development tends to correlate pretty directly with the needs of Michael's personal website and time constraints.

Development of [https://mowens.com mowens.com] is generally open-source and available on [https://github.com/mko/mowens.com-public GitHub]. The Indie.js framework, once a stable version is available, will be released simultaneously at [http://indiejs.com IndieJS.com], [https://github.com/mko/Indie.js GitHub], and on [https://npmjs.org/package/indie NPM].

From that point forth, all development will be fully open-source and separate from the app code for Michael's personal site.

=== Architecture ===

Indie.js leverages the bleeding-edge [http://nodejs.org Node.js] web framework, [http://koajs.com Koa.js], which relies heavily on <abbr title="ECMAScript 6">ES6</abbr> Generators and Proxy to provide a much more readable, reliable, and enjoyable Node.js experience than current generation Node.js web frameworks like [http://expressjs.com Express]. Callbacks are a thing of the past.

Authentication and syndication account management is handled by [[Passport]] using the [https://npmjs.org/package/passport-indieauth passport-indieauth] module also written and maintained by Michael.

Right now the specific module architecture is in flux, but the intent is that the core of the system will be a set of <code>indie-</code> modules that will provide an easily customized experience.

=== Modules ===

Currently, the software has the following modules:

* indie-webmention
* indie-authentication
* indie-categories
* indie-entries
* indie-publisher
* indie-search

The intent of these modules is that once fully abstracted, these modules could be used together as the complete Indie.js framework or as standalone components.

==== indie-webmention ====

<code>indie-webmention</code> currently supports the following featureset:

* Incoming Webmention Request Parsing
* Incoming Webmention Simple Verification
* Incoming Webmention Complex Verification
* Incoming Webmention Response Parsing/Caching
* Incoming Webmention Whitelist Validation
* Incoming Webmention Custom Validation
* Incoming Webmention Queuing / Moderation
* Incoming Webmention Publishing
* Webmention Endpoint Discovery
* Outgoing Webmention Sender

==== indie-authentication ====

<code>indie-authentication</code> currently supports the following featureset:

* [[RelMeAuth]] as primary login mechanism via <code>passport-indieauth</code>
* Syndication Account Connection for the following syndication mechanisms:
** Facebook via <code>passport-facebook</code>
** Twitter via <code>passport-twitter</code>

==== indie-categories ====

<code>indie-categories</code> currently supports the following featureset:

* h-entry compatible category tagging
* all categories page (note: highly inefficient currently, should avoid using)
* individual category archives
* basic category statistics gathering

==== indie-entries ====

<code>indie-entries</code> currently supports the following featureset:

* [[algorithmic]] URL shortening via [http://indiewebcamp.com/permalinks#Whistler Whistler]
* custom content-type dictionary for algorithmic URL shortening
* [[pagination]] for individual entries
* pagination for feed pages by timestamp
* pagination for query-selected feeds
* [[h-feed]] generation
* [[h-entry]] extensions following the spirit of the [[posts]] philosophy:
** h-as-[[article]]
** h-as-[[note]]
** h-as-[[photo]]
** h-as-[[reply]]
** h-as-[[like]]
** h-as-[[favorite]]
** h-as-[[checkin]]
* Entry metadata regarding character/word length and reading time
* Embedded [[webmentions]]
* OEmbedded Related Content
* Varying [[reply-context]] displays, based on context type

Other planned h-entry extensions:
* h-as-bookmark
* h-as-comics
* h-as-data
* h-as-event
* h-as-gallery
* h-as-presentation
* h-as-repost
* h-as-rsvp
* h-as-video

Note: The term "h-entry extension" in this context specifically refers to a superset of <code>h-entry</code> data. Every entry can be displayed purely as a basic h-entry without losing context, data fidelity, or understanding. A "h-entry extension" is a combination of additional displayed interface and data (i.e. reading time for a h-as-article or an instance of a map for a h-as-checkin) that is not required to understand the entry but may enhance the experience.

==== indie-publisher ====

<code>indie-publisher</code> is a module that enables the posting of <code>indie-entries</code> compatible entries. It includes a full suite of publishing tools including the following:

* Dynamic posting user interface
* Dynamic editing user interface
* Automatic webmention sending via <code>indie-webmention</code>
* Category management via <code>indie-categories</code>
* Backdating published datetime
* Automatic syndication post composition (not auto-posting yet)
* Syndication to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn
* Media uploading system (supports images and videos but does not optimize either yet)
* Uploaded media preview
* Automatic geolocation
* Automatic place definition to neighborhood resolution

==== indie-search ====

<code>indie-search</code> currently is an in-memory full-text search that indexes entry content type, title, summary, and content for all entries. It leverages [https://github.com/visionmedia/reds reds] by [https://github.com/visionmedia TJ Holowaychuk] and presents a noticeable performance hit upon startup when indexing more than around 10,000 entries.

== TODO ==

The Indie.js [https://github.com/mko/mowens.com-public/blob/master/TODO.md TODO] list is maintained currently on the [https://github.com/mko/mowens.com-public GitHub repo for mowens.com]. Once properly abstracted and modularized, the TODO will move to the Indie.js repo.
