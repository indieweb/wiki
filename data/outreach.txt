== Suggestions ==
* Try to get an interview on Redecentralize.org. Suggested by [[User:Robin.millette.info]] in IRC[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-02/line/1422900095101]
** Anecdotally, I found redecentralize.org before indiewebcamp.com &emdash; when I asked around about the state of FOSS social networks, lots of people pointed me there. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 11:21, 2 February 2015 (PST)
