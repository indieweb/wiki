The '''<dfn>action button</dfn>''' is a [[UI]] element introduced by [[Apple]] in [[iOS]] as a way of representing doing something with the current page or piece of content with some other application. It has expanded in meaning to be a catchall for any secondary menu items or a method for simplifying the primary set of actions / buttons on a page or piece of content.

The action button is often used to mean "share", which is also represented quite differently on other systems:

The iOS7+ action button looks too much like "upload":
