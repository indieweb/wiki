'''<dfn>analytics</dfn>''' needs a definition by someone who understands what it is and cares about it.

== Google Analytics ==

[http://google.com/analytics Google Analytics] is a hosted service that provides information on the visitors of a website.

People using it on their own site:
* [[User:Aaronparecki.com|aaronparecki.com]]
* [[User:Caseorganic.com|caseorganic.com]]
* [[User:mowens.com|mowens.com]]

== Mixpanel ==

[http://mixpanel.com Mixpanel] is a hosted service that "gives you the ability to measure any action a customer takes in your application while Google Analytics lets you measure the number of times specific pages in or site or app are viewed (page views)." (via [https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/how-is-mixpanel-different-than-google-analytics Mixpanel])

You can get 175k free data points per month (which is way more than most personal sites need) by displaying their badge somewhere on your site. After setting up your account, you can grab the badge code and verify the badge at [https://mixpanel.com/free/ https://mixpanel.com/free/].

People using it on their own site:
* [[User:mowens.com|mowens.com]] (Badge is visible in the expandable colophon)

== New Relic ==

[http://newrelic.com New Relic] is a hosted service that provides server and application performance monitoring analytics with code-level visibility. Some of its recent additions to its service have added the ability to monitor and track user experiences in the browser as well as transaction tracking to better understand how your site or app perform in the real world setting of production.

Free users only get 24 hours of data, but this tends to be enough to allow you to monitor changes in performance based on new features or to debug specific performance bottlenecks.

People using it on their own site:
* [[User:mowens.com|mowens.com]]

== Twitter Analytics ==

Twitter Analytics is a companion analytics service to Twitter and Twitter Ads that provides link tracking on Twitter and conversion tracking around those links (i.e. "How many visitors arrived directly or indirectly due to engagement with a tweet containing my URL?").

People using it on their own site:
* [[User:mowens.com|mowens.com]]

== Piwik ==

Piwik is an open source project that you install on your own service that can collect information about visitors to your website.

A project exists to make it easy to run Piwik on [https://www.openshift.com OpenShift] https://github.com/openshift/piwik-openshift-quickstart.

People using it on their own site:
* [[User:Werd.io|werd.io]] (discontinued in early 2014?)
* {{kylewm}} as of 2014-08-22. Installed out of curiosity, it's interesting to see the geographical diversity of visitors and get an idea of basic traffic volume.

== Open Web Analytics (OWA) ==

[http://www.openwebanalytics.com/ Open Web Analytics]

== Log Analyzers ==

If you have access to your server logs, you may be collecting all the data you want already. Several tools exist to analyze and visual this information.

* [http://goaccess.io/ GoAccess] command-line, realtime log analyzer written in C. Single executable, no configuration necessary.
** [[User:rascul.io]] uses it on his personal site to see high-level visit information
** {{kylewm}} has also had good, albeit limited experiences with it
* [http://www.awstats.org/ AWStats] is another popular tool
** [[User:cweiske.de]] uses it

== Criticism ==
=== Makes Your Site Slower ===
Anecdata: while browsing around the web, I often see sites (mainstream/big sites!) freezing with <blockquote>Waiting for ssl.google-analytics.com ...</blockquote> in the status bar in the bottom left for several seconds which is unacceptable latency. Based on such poor user experiences I can't imagine for what benefit I would make my users wait that long. - {{t}}

* The way to avoid this is to load analytics scripts asynchronously which is theoretically supported by the following:
** [https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/asyncMigrationExamples#migrationInstructions Google Analytics] async how to. Examples of IndieWeb sites using Google analytics asynchronously:
*** https://snarfed.org/
*** https://aaronparecki.com
*** http://caseorganic.com
*** https://mowens.com
** [https://www.gosquared.com/developer/tracker/installation/ GoSquared] async how to

Have also seen similarly: <blockquote>Transferring from fonts.googleapis.com ...</blockquote>

=== Privacy and Tracking ===

Analytics silos like Google's collect and aggregate data about your site's visitors. These statistics might be interesting to me but they are majorly profitable to them. For this reason I would prefer to use self-hosted analytics or avoid them altogether [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]
