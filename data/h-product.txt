<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-product h-product]</dfn> is a [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up product information on the web.

Currently [[Taproot]]â€™s [[micropub]] note-posting UI is marked up with h-product and the WIP [[h-x-app]] vocabulary to allow authorization UIs to show app details. h-product was the closest matching existing microformats vocab and so will do as a stop-gap as h-x-app is researched.
