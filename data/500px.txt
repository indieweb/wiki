<blockquote>A Like on an image serves as a "Well done!" nod to a photographer, while adding a photo to a Gallery is a "Wow, I love your photo so much that I want to be able to view it later. Amazing job!". Users can review the images added to a Gallery, but not the images that they have simply Liked (Heart icon) in passing.</blockquote> [https://support.500px.com/hc/en-us/articles/236067827-Where-can-I-view-my-Likes- Where-can-I-view-my-Likes]
