{{stub}}

'''<dfn>live tweeting</dfn>''' is a particular kind of [[tweetstorm]] where the posts are both meaningfully sequential and about an actual event that is happening real time, either attended in person, or viewed remotely, possibly even a viewing of a recording on an event after the fact, but still in real time.
