{{stub}}

'''<dfn>local comments</dfn>''' are [[comments]] (sometimes called <dfn>native comments</dfn>) that are made directly (locally) on a [[post]] (like an [[article]]) in the UI of the site serving it, instead of posting a [[reply]] post on an indieweb site and sending a [[webmention]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Known ===
[[Known]] (optionally) supports local comments using almost the same mechanism as comments received by webmentions. A local comment is given its own permalink URL, where it is the top-level item on the page, on the receiving site.

* e.g. http://known.kevinmarks.com/2014/trying-out-the-known-version-of-indieweb/annotations/1fdc8926b9307d390ce2a69f271e4fc4 is a comment on http://known.kevinmarks.com/2014/trying-out-the-known-version-of-indieweb

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} supports local comments on gregorlove.com (again) as of 2016-03-21. Local comments were accepted previously from 2002 to 2015. The hiatus was due to switching from [[Nucleus]] to [[ProcessWire]] and working on making local comments work more seamlessly with the ProcessWire webmention plugin.
* Uses [[CSRF token]] protection.
* Uses [[Akismet]], logging likely spam comments; no comment moderation.
* Uses an extra, hidden form input (honeypot) to prevent spam. If the form field is filled in, the comment is rejected with HTTP 403.
* 2024-01-07 [https://gregorlove.com/2024/01/reducing-native-comment-spam/ Reducing Native Comment Spam]: describes how I now close public comments after one year, still allowing signed-in people to comment. Webmentions still supported on old posts.

=== rubenwardy ===
{{rubenwardy}} supports local comments on blog.rubenwardy.com since 2023-05-07 ([https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2022/12/02/minetest-steam-deck/#comments first comment] on 2023-05-24).  Webmentions are also supported. The blog itself is statically hosted. Local comments are POSTed to an express server running on api.rubenwardy.com ([https://gitlab.com/rubenwardy/blog_api source]). Comments are then manually moderated before being added to the static site

Uses an extra, hidden (with CSS) form input to prevent spam. If the form field is filled in, the comment is rejected with HTTP 500.

=== superkuh ===
superkuh.com supports local comments on any URL on the site since 2012-12-16 by appending "/@say/A comment here" to the end of *any* URL on the domain. The comment is literally typed in the URL bar and submitted as a normal URL in the browser. Then all comments are displayed on one ([http://superkuh.com/hello/ comments page]) which the user is forwarded to by an HTML meta-refresh after making the coment. Comments to /library/ directories are saved to individual comments.html files and displayed inline with iframe. The all-site comments html file is appended to by a non-cgi webserver-agnostic perl script which tails the log files generated by nginx and parses for new log entries. Because of the admittedly weird and obscure way of submitting the comments spam is not a problem but the .html file with comments is easily edited in any text editor. Entirely local webmention receive is also supported through a similar nginx custom-POST-log-tailing perl script, https://indieweb.org/static_site#Log_HTTP_POST_data

== News Media Examples ==
(stub section)

There are still many online news media sites that accept local comments. Please note them below in one subsection per organization.


== Dropped local comments ==
Some sites have explicitly made the decision to drop local comments, for various reasons.
=== OregonLive ===
* 2019-12-29 [https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/12/oregonlive-eliminates-comments-joining-other-media-organizations.html OregonLive eliminates comments, joining other media organizations] <blockquote>Some of these conversations are uncivil, even downright nasty at times. Moderating the comments for off-topic posts or personal attacks takes time and resources that are better spent producing independent local news.</blockquote>

* [[comments]]
* [https://www.penny-arcade.com/ Penny Arcade], a multi-author site that does not accept comments from readers, uses local comments for the authors to have public discussions with eachother. E.g. {{citation

*** Jason Kottke, writing [https://kottke.org/23/10/hows-everyone-liking-the-comments#cmt-393 in a comment] that he also uses comments himself for adding things to posts: <blockquote> I wanted to add that I've (somewhat sneakily) been using comments to add context and links to the original post using updates, even when the thread isn't open. For instance, [https://kottke.org/23/10/0043271-estonias-capital-made-mas this post on Estonia's mass transit fares].</blockquote>
