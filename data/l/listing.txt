A '''<dfn>listing</dfn>''' is a type of [[post]] that is an offer to buy/sell/rent/borrow/share an item of some sort, usually for some amount or range of money, and sometimes time. 

== Why ==
You want to put an offer to buy / sell / rent / borrow / share something on your own site instead of depending on a silo like [[Craigslist]].

== How ==
=== How to markup ===
Markup your listing post with [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-listing h-listing] and use [[hashtags]] and [[POSSE]] for distribution.

=== How to respond ===
To respond to a listing post, post a [[reply]] of your own, indicating your interest, [[in-reply-to]] the listing post, and send a [[webmention]] to it.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Marty McGuire ===

On 2018-11-27 {{martymcguire}} posted several items up for grabs in [https://martymcgui.re/2018/11/27/230400/ A Blog Yard Sale (Blarg Sale)].

* Items were marked up as [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl description list] entries, no special microformats.
* The post was [[POSSE]]d to [https://www.facebook.com/marty.mcguire.54/posts/10213347676388364 Facebook], [https://twitter.com/schmarty/status/1067648425544556547 Twitter], and a couple of local mailing lists with instructions to contact Marty via his website to make requests.
* Nearly all requests came in via email and were answered in the same way.
** Most emails were from the mailing list recipients, who responded directly.
** A handful of emails were from folks who found Marty's email info on his homepage.
* Upon scheduling a pickup, the original post would be updated to <s>strike through</s> the name of the item and mark it as claimed.
* Upon a successful pickup, the item would be commented out of the post.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Craigslist]]
* [[eBay]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE ===
[[POSSE]]ing to Craigslist is likely the simplest POSSE destination for listing posts, and thus a good place to start.

How do you create a new post on Craigslist? Programmatically?

Can (may) a Craigslist post include a link to where a listing was originally posted?
