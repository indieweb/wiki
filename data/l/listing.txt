A '''<dfn>listing</dfn>''' is a type of [[post]] that is an offer to buy/sell/rent/borrow/share an item of some sort, usually for some amount or range of money, and sometimes time. 

== Why ==
You want to put an offer to buy / sell / rent / borrow / share something on your own site instead of depending on a silo like [[Craigslist]].

== How ==
=== How to markup ===
Markup your listing post with [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-listing h-listing] and use [[hashtags]] and [[POSSE]] for distribution.

=== How to respond ===
To respond to a listing post, post a [[reply]] of your own, indicating your interest, [[in-reply-to]] the listing post, and send a [[webmention]] to it.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Craigslist]]
* [[eBay]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE ===
[[POSSE]]ing to Craigslist is likely the simplest POSSE destination for listing posts, and thus a good place to start.

How do you create a new post on Craigslist? Programmatically?

Can (may) a Craigslist post include a link to where a listing was originally posted?
