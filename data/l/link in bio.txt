{{stub}} 

'''<dfn>link in bio</dfn>''' is a common expression on [[silos]] like [[Instagram]] which disallow linking from posts, directing viewers to the respective [[social media]] profile which usually allows at least one link, increasingly used to link to a <dfn>link-in-bio</dfn> service providing a flat list of links at a short vanity path.

== Why ==
Why have a page with a vertical stack of links styled as buttons with center-aligned text that looks simple / unconfusing on a mobile device?

* A single link representing a cause or advocacy organization can provide specific call-to-action links, links to local chapters, and related causes, encouraging a broader set of folks to share that one link (on their site or [[social media]]) rather trying to communicate different links to different people to share for different purposes. E.g.
** https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/

Why use a link-in-bio service in particular:
* Indirection and resisting [[social media]] link removal
** Linking to such a service in your social media profile resists scanning of specific links/domains by the social media site for targeted blocking
** For example, [[Instagram]] will remove any account with obvious adult site links but they won't if those links are behind a Linktree link

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb Examples of things that look/act like a "link in bio" service, without actually having to be on a service:

* Andy Bell: https://andy-bell.co.uk/links/
** actually references Linktree by name in the page description
* {{aciccarello}}: https://www.ciccarello.me/links/
** Adapted mobile-focused style and added QR code to open on phone
** Currently a distinct list but considering listing pinned bookmarks
* {{aaronpk}}: https://aaronpk.tv/links/
** Modified a theme from [https://github.com/MichaelBarney/LinkFree LinkFree]
** Shows a thumbnail of the 3 most recent Instagram posts, linking to the link mentioned in the post
** Shows other related links below
** At the bottom has links to the main website and other profiles

== Silo Examples ==
Alphabetical:
* [[about.me]] (perhaps the original "link in bio" service before they were called that)
* https://boook.link/
* https://campsite.bio/ (supposedly more tolerant than [[Linktree]], for now)
* [[Carrd]] carrd.co
* linkinprofile.com
* [[Linktree]]
* https://wlo.link
* https://milkshake.app/ (sites use https://msha.ke/)

== Tools ==
WordPress Plugins
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/master-link/ Master Link] by {{Template:ruxton}} has support for [[Hum]]

WordPress Themes
* Thereâ€™s an old (predating 2010-06-17) [https://wordpress.org/themes/minicard/ MiniCard] WordPress theme by [https://mikejolley.com/about/ Mike Jolley] which visually has a similar look to Linktree which is described as a [[business card site]] for displaying social media sites that had built in vCard/hCard support. 
** An example of the theme can be found in use on [http://enkerli.com/ Alex Enkerli]'s website.
