'''<dfn>lost infrastructure</dfn>''' is a reference to [https://medium.com/@anildash/the-lost-infrastructure-of-social-media-d2b95662ccd3 The Lost Infrastructure of Social Media], a [[silo]] post by [https://anildash.com/ Anil Dash] calling for IndieWeb-like technology.

This follows on from Paul Ford's [https://trackchanges.postlight.com/were-bullish-on-amp-abfc6e1f10a1 article] calling for more [[AMP]] infrastructure.

The IndieWeb has been working on replacing, improving, and extending portions this lost infrastructure, but also providing large portions of the functionality of Web 2.0 and other social media related functionality. The chart below provides some indication of what the prior functionalities were, what current social media silos provide, and finally rough equivalents of new technologies for providing these pieces. Hopefully the chart provides some indication of areas that could be built and improved as well as providing a jumping off place for those interested in some of these new technologies.
