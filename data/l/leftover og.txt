{{stub}}

'''<dfn>leftover og</dfn>''' is an example of the downsides of the [[invisible metadata]] antipattern, and what happens when you update a page or copy paste a template and don’t realize you’ve kept or propagated obsolete or inapplicable [[OGP]] meta tags because they’re not visible when you view the page you’ve created; this error has happened with [[IndieWebCamp]] event pages as recently as 2018.indieweb.org.
