</div>

== Why ==
You should use LetsEncrypt because it's the simplest way to setup easy-to-maintain [[HTTPS]] support on your indie web site.

== How To ==
See: https://letsencrypt.org/howitworks/

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{colintedford}} signed up for Let's Encrypt through [[Dreamhost]] on 2016-02-13 but needs to check for mixed content and [[WordPress]] gotchas (if any) before switching to [[https]] by default. 
* ...

== Other Independent Examples ==
=== AbstractFactory ===
{{mwunsch}} is using it on abstractfactory.tv

== Limitations ==
__TOC__
=== Requires control over your own server ===
You have to have at least some control over your webserver.

Domain aliasing is not supported, e.g. if you have your own domain and use WordPress.com to serve it. 

Similarly your own domain on *.github.io.
* E.g. {{mwunsch}} is unable to use LetsEncrypt on his own site markwunsch.com because it is hosted on GitHub.

Both [[WordPress.com]] and [[GitHub]] do have wildcard certificates for their domain names, but those can't or won't work on your own domain name.

=== Short renewal intervals ===
A LetsEncrypt certificate is only valid for 90 days, since they aim for users to automate the renewal process as much as possible. If you can't run a LetsEncrypt client on your server (because you use shared hosting, where you only can upload certs manually) you therefore have to do a manual process more often than with CAs that give certs with longer lifespans.

== Self Description ==
From their [https://letsencrypt.org/about/ about] site:

----

Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit. Let’s Encrypt is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).

The key principles behind Let’s Encrypt are:

* Free: Anyone who owns a domain name can use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a trusted certificate at zero cost.
* Automatic: Software running on a web server can interact with Let’s Encrypt to painlessly obtain a certificate, securely configure it for use, and automatically take care of renewal.
* Secure: Let’s Encrypt will serve as a platform for advancing TLS security best practices, both on the CA side and by helping site operators properly secure their servers.
* Transparent: All certificates issued or revoked will be publicly recorded and available for anyone to inspect.
* Open: The automatic issuance and renewal protocol will be published as an open standard that others can adopt.
* Cooperative: Much like the underlying Internet protocols themselves, Let’s Encrypt is a joint effort to benefit the community, beyond the control of any one organization.
