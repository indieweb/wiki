'''<dfn>location</dfn>''' is a key aspect of [[checkin]] and [[event]] [[posts]]. It's also sometimes an aspect of posts in general, e.g. where a [[note]] or [[photo]]/[[video]] was posted from. The aspect of location is sometimes referred to as [[geo]] for short.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
* {{aaronpk}} displays location information with posts, e.g. https://aaronparecki.com/2016/09/19/18/
[[File:location aaronpk.png]]

=== Jeena Paradies ===
* {{jeena}} displays a map in photo posts, e.g. https://jeena.net/photos/183
[[File:location jeena.net.png]]

=== Michael Bishop ===
* {{miklb}} shows a small map in photo posts, e.g. https://miklb.com/social/2016/08/20/58448/
[[File:location miklb.png]]

=== Jeremy Keith ===
* {{adactio}} on adactio.com [http://adactio.com/notes/6803/ since 2014-05-27] with a naked h-geo inside the note h-entry.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
* [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] using [[Taproot]] on waterpigs.co.uk [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/285/ since 2012-09-22]

=== Jonny Barnes ===
* {{jonnybarnes}} does two things. If the post simply has co-ordinates, these are included in <code>data</code> tags, and a text representation derived from OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim service is displayed. The first example of this is from 2014-01-08. This is marked up with h-adr microformats. If there is an existing venue, then this is added to the note with a map and marked up with h-card microformats. The first time this was done was 2016-10-05. See https://jonnybarnes.uk/notes/CB and https://jonnybarnes.uk/notes/Bs

== IndieWeb Software ==
* Wordpress' [https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-location/ simple location plugin] displays location data for posts

[[File:wordpress-simple-location-frontend.png]]

* [[Known]] supports [[checkin]]s and displays a map

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Instagram]] displays the location below the title on detail pages and links it to a location page on the platform.

* When you mention "place" in a post, [[Facebook]] will prompt you to add a location to the post. [[File:facebook-add-location-prompt.png]]

== How ==
=== How to determine the location of a microformat ===
To accommodate various different location use-cases, there are multiple places within a microformat structure where location data can be placed. Given a microformat, to determine it’s location:

* create a stack of property maps where location data might be found, in order of priority
* for each potential location property, search the stack for a valid property value

In more detail (pseudocode):
* given a microformat structure <var>mf</var>, to find the location it represents:
* let <var>location-sources</var> be a list of microformats, containing the following, in this order:
** <var>mf</var>
** if <var>mf</var> has a ''location'' property which is a microformat, that value
*** 2017-06-06 addition: if that value has an ''adr'' property, that value
** if <var>mf</var> has an ''adr'' property which is a microformat, that value
** if <var>mf</var> has a ''geo'' property:
*** if the geo property is a microformat, that value
*** else if the geo property is a string, parse it as a geo: URL and append a derived microformat containing the properties of the geo: URL: latitude+longitude if they’re both present, and altitude if it was present
* for each of the following location properties, search the property map stack in order of priority for a valid value. As soon as one is found, consider that the value. If none are found, the microformat does not have this property
** street-address
** extended-address
** post-office-box
** locality
** region
** postal-code
** country-name
** label
** latitude
** longitude
** altitude

==== issues ====
2017-06-06 {{sknebel}} added an extra step to deal with the case that a ''location'' property is an [[h-card]] which itself has an ''adr'' property

==== implementations ====

== Motion ==
Location information may also contain indication about motion, e.g. a person at a location, but in motion, by some method. Such information in practice includes things like:
* velocity (perhaps with a specific motion vector in 2 or 3 dimensions)
* mode of motion / transport (e.g. walking, running, bicycling, driving, stationary)

== Brainstorming ==

[http://indiewebcamp.com/note#Location Location in Notes] discusses some of the issues in adding a location to a note. 

The two most common visual elements in presenting location are a textual description of the location and/or a map.

=== Textual Description ===

There is an issue of specificity. With all of the details possible in a address, relevancy can be reduced if you add in all the possible details.

For example, to use the site of IWC Cambridge...

'''The Ray and Maria Stata Center, 32 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Vassar Street, MIT, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, USA, 02139-4309'''

The most common textual description is merely the locality, region, and country....Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. The country is often omitted if it is the same as the individual's usual country. 

From a Microformats point of view, once a location has a name(The Ray and Maria Stata Center, for example), it goes from an address to a venue(and a h-adr to a h-card).

The utility of displaying coordinates is debatable. While having them available can be useful...for example, to allow location to be identified on a map, they do not, by themselves, enhance human conception of a where a person is.

== Issues ==
=== Beware of IP Mapping ===
If you use "IP Mapping" to autogenerate or autosuggest a location for your posts, beware that may give you really bad artificial precision, thus implying you were somewhere you were not, e.g as illustrated by this article:
* 2016-04-10 [http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/ How an internet mapping glitch turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell]
** 2016-04-12 Update: [http://fusion.net/story/290772/ip-mapping-maxmind-new-us-default-location/ This is the new digital center of the United States]
