A '''<dfn>location tag</dfn>''' (sometimes called a <dfn>geo tag</dfn>) is a deliberate visible indicator on a post indicating the [[location]] that it is about, either directly in the post from its author, or sometimes as a reply to the post.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{section-stub}}
None for location tags in particular so far.

See [[location#IndieWeb_Examples]] for general IndieWeb Examples of location information in posts (some of these may be close enough to "location tags" to merit including/moving here).

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] barely supports showing location tag posts, perhaps only in a [[web action]] in a prompt to a viewer to [[suggest location|Suggest Location]] right next to a [[tag reply|Tag Photo]] webaction, perhaps only on [[photo]] posts:

[[File:2016-03-30-fb-suggest-location-action.png]]

and when clicked, that generates a [[notification]] location tag post in the original post authorâ€™s [[notifications]] stream, that so-and-so [[suggest location|suggests a location]] for your post (possibly only photos).

(suggest location notification screenshot needed)

If you (as the author of the original post) accept the location tag notification (possibly another response?), then that shows up in location tagger's [[notifications]] as a "so-and-so accepted your location suggestion on her photo." 
* (white location pin on pink background mini square icon) n minutes ago / about an hour ago etc.

(post with location tag screenshot needed)

Then the post itself shows the location as it would if the author had originally specified it themselves.

There is no indication that the location information came from a location tag post from someone else.

This is in contrast to the way [[tag-reply]] posts (in particular, [[person-tag]]s) are displayed by Facebook, where it does show who tagged whom in a photo.

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to markup ===
The proposed [[location-of]] property could be used to markup a location tag reply post. See that page for more details of how that could work:
* [[location-of]]

* [[location-of]]
* [[suggest location]]
