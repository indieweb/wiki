'''<dfn>local development</dfn>''' is (or local dev, local dev setup) the practice of having a version of your site on your local machine like a laptop that you can use for development purposes, even when offline.

== gTLDs ==

=== .dev ===
In 2015, Google applied to register the .dev TLD. In their "mission/purpose" description of the application, they stated:

<blockquote>The mission of this gTLD, .dev, is to provide a dedicated domain space in which Google can enact second-level domains specific to its projects in development. Specifically, the new gTLD will provide Google with greater ability to create a custom portal for employees to manage products and services in development.</blockquote>

In mid-2018, Google finally published the first public website at a domain on this gTLD, https://datatransferproject.dev

* [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/13/google_developer_gtld_domain_icann/ Thanks a lot, Google, for snatching .dev for yourself. It's not like the rest of us wanted it]
* [https://medium.engineering/use-a-dev-domain-not-anymore-95219778e6fd Use a .dev domain? Not anymore.]

=== Reserved gTLDs ===
It is recommended to use one of the IANA reserved gTLDs for development, as these are guaranteed to not be registered by any company in the future.

* .test
* .local
* .example
* .invalid
