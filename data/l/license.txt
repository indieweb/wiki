    '''<dfn>license</dfn>''' is terms under which you are allowed to (re)use a piece of work; in the context of the IndieWeb, for source code such as in open source [[projects]], or content, like the IndieWeb wiki itself which has a specific [[Copyright]].

== How to ==
=== How to markup licensing of a post ===
You can markup the licensing of an entire post on its permalink page with [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license rel-license]. Link from the permalink page to the license you're using (e.g. Creative Commons) and put <code>rel="license"</code> on that link.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Why and when ===
* When [[repost]]ing a post, it would be nice to know if you have permission for such repost. If you tell your server to repost something, it can check for a usable license and then either display the full post, or only link to it.
* The above could also apply to [[reply context]].
* The above could also apply to displaying remote [[comments]] and [[likes]].

=== Licensing specific things ===
There's no good current way to markup licenses for specific / individual posts in a feed like a [[composite stream]].

Similarly, if you only want to license part of a post, there's no good current way to do that either.

Some possibilities:
* Introduce a <code>u-license</code> property to [[h-entry]] that links to the license for that entry. This would replace <code>rel-license</code>, and provide more flexibility.
* Have some separate specific license for the <code>u-photo</code> / <code>u-video</code> / <code>u-audio</code> in a post
** Or just use the same <code>u-license</code> that is there for the entire post
