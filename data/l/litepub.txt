* LitePub the [[SSG]] in particular has a design methodology similar to microformats approaches: <blockquote>Posts don't have to include any special metadata (aka front matter) like title or date in them - the title, date and optional tags are parsed from the natural flow of the posts.</blockquote> (from https://github.com/mirovarga/litepub#overview)
