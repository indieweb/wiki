A '''<dfn>library</dfn>''' may refer to a physical library, like a [[personal library]] that someone may use to collect books they have [[read]] or intend to read, and perhaps track on their IndieWeb site or [[indiebookclub]], or for developers may also refer to a <dfn>software library</dfn> used by a personal website.

== software library ==
{{note|this could be its own page}}
A <dfn>software library</dfn> is re-usable software, often open source, that you can use (call out to) to implement common functionality in your own software. Software libraries typically augment (rather than replace) existing programming [[language]]s and platforms.

=== software examples ===
* [[cassis.js]] (combined PHP and JS library)
* [[link rel parser]] libraries
* ...

=== Criticisms ===
==== admintax ====
* Issue: when you choose to use (depend on) a software library (e.g. from [[npm]], [[PyPI]], etc.) for software you plan to run continuously (like for your personal site), you are signing up a regular and unpredictably growing [[admintax]] of updating those libraries and a mix of reviewing changes or incompatibilities that may break your site. 2022-03-10 {{snarfed}} [https://snarfed.org/2022-03-10_were-drowning-software-dependencies We’re drowning] <blockquote>…We’ve never before had such a wealth of freely available code, in so many languages, so easy to find and install. <br/><br/>And yet, we’re drowning.</blockquote>
