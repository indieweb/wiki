A '''<dfn>library</dfn>''' in this context typically refers to a <dfn>software library</dfn>, and sometimes to a physical library, like a [[personal library]] that an independent may use to collect books they have [[read]].

A <dfn>software library</dfn> is re-usable software, often open source, that you can use (call out to) to implement common functionality in your own software. Software libraries typically augment (rather than replace) existing programming [[language]]s and platforms.

== Software Examples ==
