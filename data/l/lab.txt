=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} has a "playground" where he keeps one-off web pages he has designed. He made the playground in May 2025. It is available at https://playground.jamesg.blog/.

The playground index lists all design experiments; every experiment has its own file or two.

In most cases, experiments are contained within a single HTML file using inline CSS, and JavaScript where appropriate. Keeping all the code for a project in one file is easier to maintain; there are no conflicts between style files.

{{artlung}} has had a lab since 2000, when it was a subdirectory of artlung.com and contained experimental HTML and JavaScript and code snippets in multiple server-side programming languages. It is now on the [https://lab.artlung.com lab.artlung.com] subdomain. [[Disqus]] has powered comments on most pages since 2009. [[Webmention]], and [[feed]] ([[RSS]]) support was added in 2024. Source code is [https://github.com/artlung/lab.artlung.com on GitHub].
