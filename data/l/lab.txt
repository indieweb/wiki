'''<dfn>lab</dfn>''' is a place to experiment with making web pages that is outside of your main website, and is a type of page several community members have.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} has a "playground" where he keeps one-off web pages he has designed. He made the playground in May 2025. It is available at https://playground.jamesg.blog/.

The playground index lists all design experiments; every experiment has its own file or two.

In most cases, experiments are contained within a single HTML file using inline CSS, and JavaScript where appropriate. Keeping all the code for a project in one file is easier to maintain; there are no conflicts between style files.
