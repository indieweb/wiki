== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} has a "playground" where he keeps one-off web pages he has designed. He made the playground in May 2025. It is available at https://playground.jamesg.blog/.

The playground index lists all design experiments; every experiment has its own file or two.

In most cases, experiments are contained within a single HTML file using inline CSS, and JavaScript where appropriate. Keeping all the code for a project in one file is easier to maintain; there are no conflicts between style files.

=== Joe Crawford ===

{{artlung}} has had a lab since 2000, when it was a subdirectory of artlung.com and contained experimental HTML and JavaScript and code snippets in multiple server-side programming languages. It is now on the [https://lab.artlung.com lab.artlung.com] subdomain. [[Disqus]] has powered comments on most pages since 2009. [[Webmention]], and [[feed]] ([[RSS]]) support was added in 2024. Source code is [https://github.com/artlung/lab.artlung.com on GitHub].

=== Matt Lee ===

Inspired by Joe's example, {{mat.tl}} has [https://mat.tl/garbage a folder called "garbage"] with an open directory listing where he dumps things he's working on, testing, etc. The name is a reference to the "garbage file" from Hackers (1995, dir. Ian Softley)

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} set up https://gregorlove.com/lab/ on 2025-08-02 during [[HTML Day]] 2025, inspired by Joe's example.
