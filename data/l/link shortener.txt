    '''<dfn>link shortener</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>URL shortener</dfn>) is a service or software that creates a [[shortlink]] (typically for any link) for use in space constrained contexts like [[SMS]], [[Twitter]], and other posting sites & software with post length limitations.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening#Notable_services for a list that does not need to be replicated here (unless there is some IndieWeb-specific use, past bad experience and/or criticism).

If we create a local page (on this wiki) for a particular centralized silo link shortener, add it here:
* [[goo.gl]]

== Dead Examples ==
{{section-stub}}
The following popular link shortener domains/services used by publications or silos have ceased functioning and thus broken numerous links across the web and [[social media]]. 

Defunct 3rd party short-link services listed alphabetically:
* [[ars.to]] — was an [[Ars Technica]] branded [[shortdomain]] wrapper around [[bitly]] which [https://web.archive.org/web/20150526201432/http://ars.to/ stopped working mid-2015]
** repair: swap the "ars.to" domain in the link with "j.mp" and keep the rest of the URL
* [[tr.im]] - see https://microformats.org/wiki/tr.im for a few repairs
* [[twtmore]]
* [[wl.gs]]
* ...

== Criticism ==
{{section-stub}}
=== Encourages link fragility ===
Link shortener services run by third parties have been criticized for worsening link fragility since historically many (most?) end up shutting down, and thus breaking all short links they created.

* See also: [[shortlink#Worsens_link_fragility]] and incorporate link shortener service specific criticism inline here.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Services ===
Link shortening services that are not in active use by anyone in the community. Check them out and if you like them add yourself to the IndieWeb Examples section accordingly.
* [[w3id]] — a shortener, that like purl.org, places a high priority on maintaining permanence / [[longevity]].
