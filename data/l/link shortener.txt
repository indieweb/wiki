See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening#Notable_services for a list that does not need to be replicated here (unless there is some IndieWeb-specific use, past bad experience and/or criticism).

If we create a local page (on this wiki) for a particular centralized silo link shortener, add it here:

== Criticism ==
{{section-stub}}
=== Encourages link fragility ===
Link shortener services run by third parties have been criticized for worsening link fragility since historically many (most?) end up shutting down, and thus breaking all short links they created.

* See also: [[shortlink#Worsens_link_fragility]] and incorporate link shortener service specific criticism inline here.

=== Services ===
Link shortening services that are not in active use by anyone in the community. Check them out and if you like them add yourself to the IndieWeb Examples section accordingly.
* [[w3id]] — a shortener, that like purl.org, places a high priority on maintaining permanence / [[longevity]].
