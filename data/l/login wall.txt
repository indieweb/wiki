'''<dfn>login wall</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>login gate</dfn>, <dfn>authwall</dfn>, or <dfn>auth wall</dfn>) is a UI [[antipattern]] used by some silos like [[Medium]] to prompt returning users with a login UI, sometimes after some number of viewed pages, that blocks viewing or using the site until the user has logged in. When presented immediately (upon first visit), this is a [[registration wall]].

== Silo Examples ==
=== LinkedIn ===
{{main|LinkedIn#Public_Profiles_Require_Login_to_View}}
[[LinkedIn]] redirects any attempt to access a profile with an "authwall" that forces you to login before you can view a profile.

Quora presents a login prompt when trying to read (how many? even just 1? or when scrolled?) answers to a question.

* 2014-03-02 Nielsen Norman Group: [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/login-walls/ Login Walls Stop Users in Their Tracks] <blockquote>Summary: Demanding that users register or log in before they can use an app or see website information has high interaction cost and defies the reciprocity principle.<br/><br/>In our many usability tests, we rarely have seen users more annoyed than when they come across a login wall. Login walls are pages that ask the user to log in or register before proceeding.</blockquote>
