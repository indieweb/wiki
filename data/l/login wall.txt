{{stub}}

'''<dfn>login wall</dfn>''' is a UI [[antipattern]] used by some silos like [[Medium]] to prompt returning users with a login UI, sometimes after some number of viewed pages, that blocks viewing or using the site until the user has logged in. When presented immediately (upon first visit), this is a [[registration wall]].

Login walls are pages that ask the user to log in or register before proceeding.</blockquote>
