'''<dfn>location-of</dfn>''' is a proposed method for marking up a [[response]] to post that indicates [[location]] information about the post.

== Why ==
Post a <code>location-of</code> response to a post that you want to explicitly suggest that the author of that post add a location to.

Why an explicit <code>location-of</code> post separate from just an [[edit]] post of a location property (is that even possible)? Because there is UX precedent (e.g. see [[#Facebook]] below) for showing special UI, and notifications for a location-of prompt, response, and acceptance.

== How to ==
TBD, possibly (brainstorming) with a <code>p-location-of</code>  (or <code>u-location-of</code> with a <code>geo:</code> URL) property and embedded h-card / h-geo / h-adr. See similar [[tag-of]] response.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

None so far.

None so far.

* [[Facebook]], however, does support [[location tag]]ging, both directly by the author of a post, and others by [[suggest location|suggesting a location tag]]. See [[location_tag#Facebook]] for more details.
