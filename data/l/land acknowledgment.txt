<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Land acknowledgment</dfn>''', also called territory acknowledgment, is the practice of making a brief statement to recognize and honor the indigenous heritage of the land where an event is taking place or a website or business is located.</span> 

== Why ==
As the Duwamish Tribe describes in [https://www.duwamishtribe.org/land-acknowledgement How to Make a Land Acknowledgement]
<blockquote>
For non-Indigenous communities, land acknowledgement is a powerful way of showing respect and honoring the Indigenous Peoples of the land on which we work and live. Acknowledgement is a simple way of resisting the erasure of Indigenous histories and working towards honoring and inviting the truth.
</blockquote>

=== Controversy ===
Some perceive land acknowledgment as a token gesture when not done thoughtfully, such as when using a pre-scripted statement, or when not accompanied with a change in practices.
