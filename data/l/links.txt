'''<dfn>links</dfn>''' is a top level [[page]] on many indieweb sites that serves as a [[link in bio]] feature.

== Why ==
The <code>/links</code> top level page (sometimes redirected to <code>/links/</code>) seems to be an increasingly popular IndieWeb method for replacing [[Linktree]] or other link-in-bio services.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
See [[link_in_bio#IndieWeb_Examples]] for more details on the link in bio uses in particular of each example.
In rough order of since: (need dates/resorting for all the ????-??-?? examples). All of these work at <code>/links</code>, a few redirect to add a trailing slash (<code>/links/</code>)
