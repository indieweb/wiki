'''<dfn>links</dfn>''' is a top level [[page]] on many indieweb sites that serves as a [[link in bio]] feature, though historically it has also been used as a path for a [[linkblog]].

== Why ==
The <code>/links</code> top level page (sometimes redirected to <code>/links/</code>) seems to be an increasingly popular IndieWeb method for replacing [[Linktree]] or other link-in-bio services.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
See [[link_in_bio#IndieWeb_Examples]] for more details on the link in bio uses in particular of each example.
In rough order of since: (need dates/resorting for all the ????-??-?? examples). All of these work at <code>/links</code>, a few redirect to add a trailing slash (<code>/links/</code>)

** "The web was always about redistribution of power. Let’s bring that back.<br><br><br><br><br>  Many of us got excited about technology because of the web, and are discovering, latterly, that it was always the web itself — rather than technology as a whole — that we were excited about. The web is a movement: more than a set of protocols, languages, and software, it was always about bringing about a social and cultural shift that removed traditional gatekeepers to publishing and being heard."
