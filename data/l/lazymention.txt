'''<dfn>[https://github.com/strugee/lazymention lazymention]</dfn>''' is an open source service you can run on a [[Node.js]] server to send [[Webmention]]s from static sites. Its general purpose is to add dynamic [[building-block]] features to otherwise static websites.

* Implementation: lazymention is a [[Node.js]] daemon written by {{strugee}}. 

Lazymention crawls submitted URLs for [[h-feed]] and [[h-entry]] markup, then does processing if it encounters any new content.

Currently it supports [[Webmention]].

[[WebSub]] is planned for the future.

The source (and documentation) is [https://github.com/strugee/lazymention on GitHub].
