'''<dfn>[https://github.com/strugee/lazymention lazymention]</dfn>''' is a [[Node.js]] daemon written by {{strugee}}. Its purpose is to add dynamic [[building-block]] features to otherwise static websites. This is done by crawling submitted URLs for [[h-feed]] and [[h-entry]] markup, then doing processing if the daemon encounters any new content.

Currently it supports [[Webmention]]; [[WebSub]] is planned for the future.

The source (and documentation) is [https://github.com/strugee/lazymention on GitHub].
