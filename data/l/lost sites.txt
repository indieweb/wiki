{{stub}}

'''<dfn>lost sites</dfn>''' are former sites (including IndieWeb sites) on domains that the owner abandoned or lost control over (AKA <dfn>domain deaths</dfn>), are unresponsive or often taken over by other parties, sometimes turned into [[zombie]]s; links to such domains should be replaced with Internet Archive versions.

Note: a site that removes large (most or all) of its content has experienced a [[site-death]] and the domain owner may still be the same, they may use it for some other purpose. It's not a "lost site" in that regard since the owner still maintains control over it, and may restore some or most of the content eventually.

== Why document ==
{{section-stub}}
We document lost sites that are relevant or mentioned in the IndieWeb, or technologies that the IndieWeb is based on, or related projects & proposals, so if people go looking for them, there is some chance they’ll find this page and learn what happened to such sites.

We also document lost sites as a substitute for old links on the wiki. Instead of linking to the lost site, we link to its domain as a page on this wiki e.g. [[indieweb.xyz]] instead of <nowiki>https://indieweb.xyz</nowiki>.

== How to document ==
{{section-stub}}
How to document lost sites:
* '''Keep in mind, be kind.''' Most lost sites were a personal effort or possibly a hobby or other labor of love that the creator/maintainer either ran out of time to maintain (see: [[life happens]]), or otherwise forgot or lost interest. When you document a lost site, be kind as to possible reasons etc.
* '''What to document''' any site/domain that has/had links on the IndieWeb wiki (or mentioned in chat) is worth documenting because 
* '''Create a domain page or redirect''' when you find a lost site, create a page (or redirect to an existing page about that person, project, or org) for its domain here on the wiki so there's a place to relink other links to that domain on the wiki.
* '''Add it to a list below'''
** IndieWeb Examples: for former IndieWeb sites, e.g. mentioned in an [[IndieWeb Examples]] section on another page on the wiki
** Notable Independent Sites: other independent sites (personal sites) that were never explicit IndieWeb Examples per se.
** Other Examples: other domains that the IndieWeb wiki linked to at some point or another
* '''Consider adding to site-deaths or zombies'''
** [[site-deaths]]: If the lost site also lost a lot of profiles and content from other people, add it to site-deaths.
** [[zombie]]s: If the lost site has been squatted or otherwise taken over by a dangerous site (scamming, phishing, [[cryptocurrency]] mining or other kind of deception), please add it to the [[zombie]] page.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
When adding a site here, either link it to its last valid/recognizable Internet Archive version (beware of archived [[zombie]] versions), or to the equivalent IndieWeb.org User:domain page.

== Other Examples ==
Examples of domains linked from IndieWeb sites or other web standards / open web / web development or events related sites. If you find a dead domain from a link you previously blogged (or saw on this wiki), feel free to add it here carefully marked up like: <blockquote><code>&lt;nowiki&gt;dead-domain.example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;</code></blockquote> to avoid making a live link, and to help warn other IndieWeb folks and provide at least a minimal blocklist for anyone crawling IndieWeb sites.
