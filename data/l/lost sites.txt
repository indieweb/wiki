{{stub}}

'''<dfn>lost sites</dfn>''' are former sites (including IndieWeb sites) on domains that the owner abandoned or lost control over (AKA <dfn>domain deaths</dfn>), are unresponsive or often taken over by other parties, sometimes turned into [[zombie]]s; links to such domains should be replaced with Internet Archive versions.

Note: a site that removes large (most or all) of its content has experienced a [[site-death]] and the domain owner may still be the same, they may use it for some other purpose. It's not a "lost site" in that regard since the owner still maintains control over it, and may restore some or most of the content eventually.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* kylewm(.)com, {{kylewm}}'s personal site
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416012837/neverusethisfont.com/blog/ neverusethisfont(.)com] - {{aaronpk}}'s blog from 2008-2010, after which the content was moved and redirected to aaronparecki.com
* [[Woodwind|woodwind.xyz]] domain abandoned since 2018
* davidpea(.)ch, [[User:Davidpea.ch|David Peach]]â€™s personal site since 2019 at least

== Other Examples ==
* userscripts.org, directory of browser aka Greasemonkey user scripts
* See [[zombie#Examples|zombie examples]] for particularly dangerous lost sites.

== See Also ==
* [[site-deaths]]
* [[zombie]]
* Use-case: don't bother indexing/crawling links to these domains
