{{stub}}

'''<dfn>lost sites</dfn>''' are former sites (including IndieWeb sites) on domains that the owner abandoned or lost control over (AKA <dfn>domain deaths</dfn>), are unresponsive or often taken over by other parties, sometimes turned into [[zombie]]s; links to such domains should be replaced with Internet Archive versions.

Note: a site that removes large (most or all) of its content has experienced a [[site-death]] and the domain owner may still be the same, they may use it for some other purpose. It's not a "lost site" in that regard since the owner still maintains control over it, and may restore some or most of the content eventually.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
When adding a site here, either link it to its last valid/recognizable Internet Archive version (beware of archived [[zombie]] versions), or to the equivalen IndieWeb.org User:domain page.

== Other Examples ==
Examples of domains linked from IndieWeb sites or other web standards / open web / web development or events related sites. If you find a dead domain from a link you previously blogged (or saw on this wiki), feel free to add it here carefully marked up like: <blockquote><code>&lt;nowiki&gt;dead-domain.example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;</code></blockquote> to avoid making a live link, and to help warn other IndieWeb folks and provide at least a minimal blocklist for anyone crawling IndieWeb sites.
