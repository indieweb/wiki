{{stub}}

'''<dfn>lolinition</dfn>''' is a portmanteau of LOL and definition, instances of which are created to cause the reader to literally laugh out loud, like when asking what something is, sometimes a [[snarkinition]], though more often merely a humorous way to answer what might otherwise be a rhetorical question in a [[discuss]]ion channel.

== Examples ==
Ask these in a [[discuss]]ion channel:
* What is love?
* What is time anyway?

== See Also ==
* [[lulz]]
