'''<dfn>lbry</dfn>''' is a specialist content silo, and alternative to YouTube silo which provides video hosting, multi-platform app.

LBRY (pronounced library by Bryan Lunduke of the Lunduke Show) uses blockchain technology, and allows creators to charge a fee in exchange for viewing content.

It seems to be ad-free right-now, and produces OpenSource, although it's unclear if the entire platform is in the open.
