A '''<dfn>list</dfn>''' is a feature on personal sites, often a [[page]] (not a [[post]]), for collections of things that may not need separate posts, and distinct from a [[listicle]].

Less used on the IndieWeb: a list is a feature on some [[silo]]s such as Twitter for collecting a set of people you want to follow for a specific reason such as a topic or area of expertise.
