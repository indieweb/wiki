A '''<dfn>list</dfn>''' is a feature on personal sites, often a [[page]] (not a [[post]]), for collections of specific kinds of posts or things that may not need separate posts, and distinct from a [[listicle]].

Less used on the IndieWeb: a list is a feature on some [[silo]]s such as Twitter for collecting a set of people you want to follow for a specific reason such as a topic or area of expertise.

== Kinds of lists ==
Sometimes lists of specific things have a distinct appearance or different functionality.
Some of these have their own pages (add examples inside them), and some of these are placeholders to collect examples until there are enough (2-3?) to create a separate page for them.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Tantek ===
Tantek keeps various lists of things to do / contribute in public that he would like to keep on his personal site:
* [[tinbox]] - inbox here on the IndieWeb wiki for things he wants to do / take care of that are either for the wiki / community, or related to the IndieWeb in some broader way
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tantek#articles_to_update Wikipedia lists of articles to update, create, etc.]
* ...
Tantek also keeps local plain text files for various lists of things that he would like to move some of them to somewhere public:
* ideas, thoughts to blog/post about, useful for capturing without having to worry about editing and publishing per [https://tantek.com/2023/365/t1/capture-first-edit-publish-later capture first, edit & publish later]
