'''<dfn>login</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>sign-in</dfn>) is a feature of many websites where a user is asked to provide a username (often an [[email]] address) and password in order to gain (more) access to the site; the [[Main_Page|IndieWebCamp wiki]] uses [[IndieLogin]] for delegated sign-in; other sites or services directly use [[IndieAuth]] for delegated sign-in.

== Delegated Sign-in ==
(stub, consider making a separate page if this grows too big)

Delegated sign-in is a growing method for websites to allow signing-in via a third party authentication provider, instead of every website asking users to create a new username & password (and submit their email address).

=== Delegated Sign-in Standards ===
There are several standardized delegated sign-in protocols
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[RelMeAuth]]

Obsolete (per https://openid.net/developers/specs/)
* [[OpenID]] 1.x, 2.0

=== Delegated Sign-in Services ===
There are services that implement one or more delegated sign-in protocols
* [[IndieLogin]] is a delegated sign-in provider that supports [[IndieAuth]], [[OpenID]], and [[RelMeAuth]] with a specific set of OAuth supporting external services such as [[GitHub]] and [[Twitter]].
* ...

=== Proprietary Delegated Sign-in ===
There are several popular proprietary delegated sign-in services that are often displayed together on a website using delegated sign-in:

Examples from the above screenshot:
* [[Google Identity Platform|Sign in with Google]]
* Sign in with [[Facebook]]
* Sign in with [[Twitter]]
* Sign in with [[Github]]

Displaying such a variety of brands/logos/appearances is also known as the '''[[NASCAR problem]]'''.

The following from the screen shot are not examples of delegated sign-in:
* Sign in with email — not delegated, this typically depends on an email-based service-specific account and password, though some services may use a one-time emailed authorization link.
* Sign in with phone — also not delegated, this typically depends on a one-time code sent via [[SMS]] to a mobile phone

** "If you build login/password reset interfaces, please don't prevent pasting into password fields. It reduces security because manually entering a secure password is hard for most people and worse for many disabled people, so  it's easier to use a simple password instead."
