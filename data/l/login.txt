{{stub}}
'''<dfn>login</dfn>''' is a feature of many websites where a user is asked to provide a username (often an [[email]] address) and password in order to gain (more) access to the site; the [[Main_Page|IndieWebCamp wiki]] uses [[IndieLogin]]; other sites or services directly use [[IndieAuth]].

** "If you build login/password reset interfaces, please don't prevent pasting into password fields. It reduces security because manually entering a secure password is hard for most people and worse for many disabled people, so  it's easier to use a simple password instead."
