'''<dfn>letsjam</dfn>''' is a [[static site generator]] built by {{capjamesg}} that he uses to build his site.

== letsjam Features ==

letsjam takes a HTML or Markdown document and generates it into a full HTML page. Attributes such as a template to use for a page and the title of a page can be specified in front matter. These values are then carried over to the final page generated. If a template is specified, the contents of a document will be placed in the "content" area of the specified template.

Using letsjam, you can generate:

* blog posts
* non-article posts
* posts in groups (i.e. [[likes]] or [[bookmarks]])
* date archive pages
* sitemap
* feeds
* and more...

letsjam is designed to be similar to Jekyll in structure so that James could easily move his site from Jekyll to his own generator.

== Using letsjam ==

The letsjam source code is [https://github.com/capjamesg/letsjam open source on GitHub] with instructions on how to install the generator.

== IndieWeb Use ==

{{capjamesg}} uses letsjam for his personal website [https://jamesg.blog jamesg.blog].
