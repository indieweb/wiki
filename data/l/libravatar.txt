'''<dfn>[https://www.libravatar.org/ Libravatar]</dfn>''' is a protocol [https://wiki.libravatar.org/api/ specification] for fetching avatar images for E-Mail addresses and [[OpenID]]s in a decentralized way.

It is also an open source service to host a profile photo (avatar) for e-mail addresses and personal sites used for identification (e.g. OpenID, IndieAuth). The photos can then automatically be displayed on your posts and comments on any website that supports it.

Alternatively, you can get a profile photo from the [[representative h-card]] and [[icon]] from a personal site.

In contrast to [[Gravatar]], which is a centralized service, libravatar is decentralized - each person can host their own avatar server. [https://wiki.libravatar.org/running_your_own/ Multiple server implementations] are available.

== How to use ==
To display avatars on your site, use an [https://wiki.libravatar.org/libraries/ Open Source library or plugin] (e.g. [https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/libravatar/ Wordpress plugin])

To host your own avatars on your domain, there are [https://wiki.libravatar.org/running_your_own/ a few options]. I personally just use a [https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar-lite quick-n-dirty shell script].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

== Issues ==
=== No test suite ===
There doesn't appear to be a test suite for libravatar. Web searching for "libravatar test suite" doesn't find anything and no mention of "test" on their wiki home page
