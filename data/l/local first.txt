{{stub}}

'''<dfn>local first</dfn>''' is a UX design method for already installed applications (including webapps with [[service worker]]s) where they are built such that the user can use them without requiring any non-local (like network) interactions or connections, typically to at least [[create]] and [[edit]] content which may at a later time be published or synchronized to another device perhaps across a network.

Examples of applications that work in a local first manner.
* Traditional native installed email applications (e.g. Thunderbird)

== First means first ==
Local <em>first</em> literally means once you’ve installed the app (e.g. loaded the web page), there is nothing else you have to do <em>first</em> in order to use its features involving local UI / content creation and editing, including, no requirement to sync-up or sign-in to a server, or create an account <em>first</em>, because that would make it local <em>second</em> to such requirements.

For counter-example, the [[Quip]] iOS app has an option when launching it to "Skip Creating an Account", however, if you choose that when offline (e.g. airplane mode), then you get the following error:

<blockquote style="text-align:center; width:18em"><h3>Sign In Error</h3><p>We encountered an error signing you in to Quip. There may be a problem with your network connection, or there may be a temporary error with the service.</p></blockquote>

When of course, skipping creating an account should not require signing in to Quip, or a network connection, or a "service" at all!
