{{stub}}

'''<dfn>local first</dfn>''' is a UX design method for already installed applications (including webapps with [[service worker]]s) where they are built such that the user can use them without requiring any non-local (like network) interactions or connections, typically to at least [[create]] and [[edit]] content which may at a later time be published or synchronized to another device perhaps across a network.
