'''<dfn>local first</dfn>''' is a UX design method for installed applications (including webapps with [[service worker]]s) that enables the user to make use of some or preferably all of their features without requiring any non-local (like network) interactions or connections, typically to at least view, [[create]], [[edit]], and save content which may at a later time be published to the web or synchronized to another device perhaps across a network.

== First means first ==
Local <em>first</em> literally means once you‚Äôve installed the app (e.g. loaded the web page), there is nothing else you have to do <em>first</em> in order to use its features involving local UI / content creation and editing, including, no requirement to sync-up or sign-in to a server, or create an account <em>first</em>, or any other kind of "set up" that requires network access, because that would make it local <em>second</em> to such requirements.
=== No account required ===
For counter-example, the [[Quip]] iOS app has an option when launching it to "Skip Creating an Account", however, if you choose that when offline (e.g. airplane mode), then you get the following error:

[[Image:2020-036-ios-quip-skip-account-fail.png|240px]]

<blockquote style="text-align:center; width:18em"><b>Sign In Error</b><p>We encountered an error signing you in to Quip. There may be a problem with your network connection, or there may be a temporary error with the service.</p></blockquote>

When of course, skipping creating an account should not require signing in to Quip, or a network connection, or a "service" at all!

== Brainstorming ==
=== Blog that loads recent posts ===
One example of a (at least partial) local first IndieWeb "app" could be a personal site that when the home page is loaded, uses [[offline first]] techniques to proactively load the information necessary to render recent post permalinks, without ever having loaded those pages directly from the server.
* {{t}} is considering implementing this (describing here in case others can use some of these techniques, rather than only on [[Falcon]] page)
** load the past year‚Äôs bim files via [[offline first]] techniques
** implement client-side rendering of those bim files via a fully [[CASSIS]] implementation of [[Falcon]] rendering code
** use [[service worker]] to detect when a permalink is being accessed whose storage file has been cached, and call that client-side rendering code instead
** challenge: cache invalidation, i.e. when to "reload" older bim files (most recent bim storage file should be loaded whenever online via [[offline first]] techniques) that may have minor fixes/updates.
