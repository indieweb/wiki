== Indie Web ==
There is interest in a separate IndieWeb logo, though nothing official yet.

The most recent work is the below 2016 first [[#Proposal|proposal/draft]] from {{shaners}}:

=== Background ===
Why is there no "IndieWeb" logo separate from the "IndieWebCamp" logo?

There's no explicit reason. Implicitly a separate IndieWeb logo would be more work that no one has had the time to work on one iteratively until it has community consensus / acceptance. 

The IndieWebCamp logo was a volunteer effort in the first place, first by co-founder Crystal Beasley, then updated by {{shaners}} to the current logo in use.

We also switched everything from being all "IndieWebCamp" (e.g. IRC, indiewebcamp.com) to "IndieWeb", *after* the iteration of the IndieWebCamp logo, so the need (for a separate "IndieWeb" logo) didnâ€™t really become apparent until after the fact.

=== Proposal ===
First draft Indie Web logomark (logotype, lockup and colors would come after this mark is finalized) by {{veganstraightedge}} (2016-10-31).

==== Feedback ====
* Please add your feedback here. {{veganstraightedge}}
* I am looking for an official logo, and I like the idea of something that can be a small 16 x 16ish icon.  This would work if the colors were right {{tedt}}

==== Community Contributions ====
Alternative IndieWeb logo approaches from community members. Feel free to add your own!
