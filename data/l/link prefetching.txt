{{stub}}

'''<dfn>link prefetching</dfn>''' is a mechanism to allow browsers to prefetch links that the user might visit in the near future, such as the next/previous chronological post.

For more details see: 
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
If you support [[sequential navigation]], you should use <code>rel=prefetch</code> on your post permalink pages, specifically on links to the previous and next post.

This will reduce the loading time (improve perceived performance) when a user clicks on a next or prev button/link on your post permalink.

== How to ==
{{section-stub}}
=== How to publish rel prefetch ===
Append <kbd> prefetch</kbd> to the your existing next and previous links <code>rel</code> attribute.

For more details on rel=prefetch, see:
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/prefetch

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{section-stub}}
* {{t}} supports rel-prefetch on his [[sequential navigation]] prev/next links on his post permalinks and day aggregations (on prev/next day links), since 2024-08-13 (implemented back to all posts 2010-01-01 and later).
