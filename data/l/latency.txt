    '''<dfn>latency</dfn>''' is one aspect of [[performance]], specifically, the amount of time between when an action is taken (like when a user clicks a link) and the result is seen (like when a browser displays the page); on the indieweb, latency may apply to how quickly a site displays & responds to [[UX|interaction]], a site shows a [[post]] after a user [[create]]s it, [[posts]] show [[comments]] and other [[responses]] after receiving [[Webmention]]s, etc.
