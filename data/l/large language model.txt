{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>large language model</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn><abbr>LLM</abbr></dfn>) usually a reference to a service, like [[OpenAI]]’s ChatGPT, that synthesizes text based on a massive set of prose typically crawled and indexed from the open web and other sources and [[wikifying#Do_not_copy_from_LLM_generated_text|should not be used to contribute content to the IndieWeb wiki]]; several IndieWeb sites disclaim any use thereof for their content.

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
=== Why disclaim ===
With more and more LLM-generated content being published to the web, e.g. by news outlets like Hoodline, people will increasingly look for actual human-written content instead, and disclaiming your use of LLMs will appeal to a larger and larger audience.

== How to ==
{{section-stub}}

== Understanding and managing LLM traffic ==

'''See [[large language model traffic]]'''

=== Promote your work as human created ===
You can add a <dfn id="notbyai">[https://notbyai.fyi/ Not By AI]</dfn> badge on your website. See some [[#IndieWeb_Examples|IndieWeb Examples]] below.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In rough date order of adding to personal sites:
* Hidde de Vries added a ‘no LLMs involved’ note to the site-wide footer of [https://hidde.blog hidde.blog] from 17 March 2023
<blockquote>No language models were involved in writing the blog posts on here.</blockquote>

* {{capjamesg}} since at least 2023-07-14(?) added a "Not By AI" [[buttons#Related_efforts|image button]] on all his blog posts going back to [https://jamesg.blog/2020/08/30/adventures-on-the-indieweb/ at least 2020]

* {{aaronpk}} put a "Not by AI" badge in his global website footer (e.g. bottom of https://aaronparecki.com/) next to the IndieWeb/Microformats/Webmention [[buttons]] on 2023-10-15.

* {{t}} put a general disclaimer about no use of LLMs for his site on his homepage [https://tantek.com/2023/365/t2/no-large-language-model-llm-used on 2023-12-31]:
* https://tantek.com/#disclaimer <blockquote> No large language models were used in the production of this site. (inspired by RFC 9518 Appendix A ¶ 4) </blockquote>

* {{lazcorp}} put a general disclaimer about no use of LLMs for his site on his [https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook blog homepage] on 2024-01-04 and also a similar statement and button (by https://notbyai.fyi/) on the footer of all pages on 2024-01-05:
<blockquote>No large language models (LLM) or similar AI technologies were involved in writing the blog posts on here.</blockquote>

* {{to2ds}} Updated the existing blurb above the fold on the homepage to use the term "LLMs" instead of the generic "AI." [https://toddpresta.com/#nollms] on 2024-01-05. Also added (Not BY AI) written and painted badges to the common footer along with the IndieWeb badge and link.

* {{beesbuzz.biz}} Added a blurb to [https://beesbuzz.biz/about#ai their about page] on 2025-07-23.

* {{mat.tl}} blocks as much of this as possible. His content is not permitted to be used to train such things. His [[Libre.fm]] and [[1800www.com]] projects are changing their mission/focus as result. 

* {{artlung}} has a [[slash page]] under "[[ai|/ai]]" ([https://artlung.com/ai/ /artlung.com/ai]) describing his usage and positions on large language models and related technology.

* {{addyourself}}

== IndieWeb Wiki Examples ==
Do not use LLMs for content for the wiki: 
* in definitions: [[definition#Do_not_copy_from_LLM_generated_text]]
* or content in general: [[wikifying#Do_not_copy_from_LLM_generated_text]]

Don't even think about using ChatGPT to contribute material to the wiki, because you don't have the ability to know you can contribute it to the public domain / CC0.
* 2024-01-08 The Guardian UK: [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai ‘Impossible’ to create AI tools like ChatGPT without copyrighted material, OpenAI says] <br/>

== Other Examples ==

<blockquote>Some workers described realizing, often in hindsight, that as prompting during breaks became habitual, downtime no longer provided the same sense of recovery. (...)

<blockquote>The title is somewhat tongue-in-cheek; we recognize that AI is not sentient, that it’s management, not AI, that fires people, but also that there are many ways that AI can “kill” a job, by sapping the pleasure one derives from work, draining it of skill and expertise, or otherwise subjecting it to degradation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I heard from workers who recounted how managers used AI to justify laying them off, to speed up their work, and to make them take over the workload of recently terminated peers. I heard from workers at the biggest tech giants and the smallest startups—from workers at Google, TikTok, Adobe, Dropbox, and CrowdStrike, to those at startups with just a handful of employees. I heard stories of scheming corporate climbers using AI to consolidate power inside the organization. I heard tales of AI being openly scorned in company forums by revolting workers. And yes, I heard lots of sad stories of workers getting let go so management could make room for AI. I received a message from one worker who wrote to say they were concerned for their job—and a follow-up note just weeks later to say that they’d lost it.</blockquote>
