{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>large language model</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn><abbr>LLM</abbr></dfn>) usually a reference to a service, like [[OpenAI]]’s ChatGPT, that synthesizes text based on a massive set of prose typically crawled and indexed from the open web and other sources and [[wikifying#Do_not_copy_from_LLM_generated_text|should not be used to contribute content to the IndieWeb wiki]]; several IndieWeb sites disclaim any use thereof for their content.

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
=== Why disclaim ===
With more and more LLM-generated content being published to the web, e.g. by news outlets like Hoodline, people will increasingly look for actual human-written content instead, and disclaiming your use of LLMs will appeal to a larger and larger audience.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In rough date order of adding to personal sites:
=== Hidde ===
Hidde de Vries added a ‘no LLMs involved’ note to the site-wide footer of [https://hidde.blog hidde.blog] from 17 March 2023

=== Aaron Parecki ===

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} put a general disclaimer about no use of LLMs for his site on his homepage [https://tantek.com/2023/365/t2/no-large-language-model-llm-used on 2023-12-31]:
* https://tantek.com/#disclaimer <blockquote> No large language models were used in the production of this site. (inspired by RFC 9518 Appendix A ¶ 4) </blockquote>

== IndieWeb Wiki Examples ==
Do not use LLMs for content for the wiki: 
* in defintions: [[definition#Do_not_copy_from_LLM_generated_text]]
* or content in general: [[wikifying#Do_not_copy_from_LLM_generated_text]]

Don't even think about using ChatGPT to contribute material to the wiki, because you don't have the ability to know you can contribute it to the public domain / CC0.
* 2024-01-08 The Guardian UK: [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai ‘Impossible’ to create AI tools like ChatGPT without copyrighted material, OpenAI says] <br/>

== Other Examples ==
* IETF example: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9518.html#appendix-A-4 <blockquote>No large language models were used in the production of this document.</blockquote>

== IndieWeb opinions ==

== Criticism ==
=== Encourages disregarding copyright ===
* https://t.co/1rmFNq7spR short link to 2024-04-06 NYT: [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/technology/tech-giants-harvest-data-artificial-intelligence.html How Tech Giants Cut Corners to Harvest Data for A.I.] / OpenAI, Google and Meta ignored corporate policies, altered their own rules and discussed skirting copyright law as they sought online information to train their newest artificial intelligence systems.
* 2024-04-30 NYTimes: [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/media/newspapers-sued-microsoft-openai.html 8 Daily Newspapers Sue OpenAI and Microsoft Over A.I.] / The suit, which accuses the tech companies of copyright infringement, adds to the fight over the online data used to power artificial intelligence.

=== Encourages training on private data ===
* https://twitter.com/heyitsseher/status/1776823362292969880 <blockquote>Google quietly changed policies to scrape public Google Doc data to train AI.<br /><br />Then purposely released new terms of service on "Fourth of July weekend, when people were typically focused on the holiday"<br /><br />How Tech Giants Cut Corners to Harvest Data for A.I. https://t.co/1rmFNq7spR</blockquote>

=== Discourages open creativity and sharing ===
* 2024-03-11 {{lmorchard}}: [https://blog.lmorchard.com/2024/03/11/dance-for-the-bots/ Dance like the bots aren't watching?] / TL;DR: Why bother sharing anything on the open web if it's just going to be fodder for extractive, non-reciprocal bots?

* 2024-04-22 The Atlantic: [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/04/generative-ai-search-llmo/678154/ It’s the End of the Web as We Know It] <blockquote>SEO will morph into LLMO: large-language-model optimization, the incipient industry of manipulating AI-generated material to serve clients’ interests. <br/>[...]<br/>LLMs aren’t people we connect with. Eventually, people may stop writing, stop filming, stop composing—at least for the open, public web.</blockquote>

=== Abused to waste developer time ===
Criticism: LLMs used to waste developer time with fake security bounty bug reports:
* (from the maintainer of [[curl]]) 2024-01-02 [https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/ The I in LLM stands for intelligence] <blockquote>Like for the email spammers, the cost of this ends up in the receiving end. The ease of use and wide access to powerful LLMs is just too tempting. I strongly suspect we will get more LLM generated rubbish in our Hackerone inboxes going forward.</blockquote>

=== Fails basic context dependence ===
Can fail basic context-dependence, like examples vs commands:

=== Scraping for training widely rejected ===
85% of Cloudflare's customers prefer to block GenAI training scrapers:
