{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>large language model</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn><abbr>LLM</abbr></dfn>) usually a reference to a service, like [[OpenAI]]’s ChatGPT, that synthesizes text based on a massive set of prose typically crawled and indexed from the open web and other sources and [[wikifying#Do_not_copy_from_LLM_generated_text|should not be used to contribute content to the IndieWeb wiki]]; several IndieWeb sites disclaim any use thereof for their content.
