A '''<dfn>meme</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb is a [[post]] type consisting of a funny or provocative image with a brief text [[note]] overlaid on top of it, usually in white all capitals text outlined in black, similar to a single-pane [[comic]], yet with text that reads like prose rather than a caption.

In general a meme is an idea that propagates through minds by replication (the idea itself encourages those understanding it to propagate it to others).
