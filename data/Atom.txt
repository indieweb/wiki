'''<dfn>[http://atomenabled.org/ Atom]</dfn>''' is an XML format for publishing [[feeds]] that was developed as a more formally specified alternative to [[RSS]].

'''[[h-entry]]''' and '''[[h-feed]]''' are [[microformats2]] vocabularies based on Atom, which supersede the classic [[hAtom]] microformat.

=== Sandeep Shetty ===
'''sandeep.io''' generates an Atom feed from [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed h-feed] (using an h-feed to atom proxy). See [http://www.sandeep.io/98 DRY: h-feed enabled = Atom enabled] -[[User:Www.sandeep.io|Www.sandeep.io]] 14:06, 30 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} generates (using [[Falcon]]) a minimal subset Atom+ActivityStreams feed on tantek.com from storage. Due to bandwidth inefficiency of XML formats (and apparent bandwidth abuse of XML consuming code/servers), his Atom [[feed file]] only has the most recent 1 item(s), whereas his [[h-feed]] on his home page has the latest 64 items (as of 2015-265). See also [[feed_file#Criticism|feed file: Criticism]] and in particular [[feed#Criticism|feed: Criticism]].

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby]] publishes auto-discoverable ATOM feeds on all feed pages using [[Taproot]] on [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] e.g. [https://waterpigs.co.uk/services/microformats-to-atom/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwaterpigs.co.uk%2F the homepage] since ????-??-??.
* The feeds are automatically generated from the h-entry microformats on the page, so I only have to maintain the HTML which works for humans and machines rather than two copies. The endpoint I use for converting is open for anyone to use: [https://waterpigs.co.uk/services/microformats-to-atom/ microformats to ATOM] --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 10:17, 10 February 2015 (PST)

=== Christian Weiske ===
[[User:cweiske.de]]'s blog natively generates full-text atom feeds for tag-filtered and all posts

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} publishes an Atom feed for all post feeds (most recent iteration since 2014-09-13).
* add ?feed=atom to any regular feed for an Atom version. e.g.,
** https://kylewm.com/?feed=atom
** https://kylewm.com/photos?feed=atom
** https://kylewm.com/tags/indieweb?feed=atom
* Entries includes simple reply/repost context

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} publishes an Atom feed for articles as of 2015-02-11
* http://gregorlove.com/articles.atom
* Previously I was publishing an RSS 2.0 feed that was delivered by [[FeedBurner]]. I migrated back to a self-hosted feed due to the unsure future of FeedBurner, plus having more control of the feed since it is on my own domain again.

== Projects ==
=== activitystreams-unofficial ===
{{snarfed}}'s [https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial activitystreams-unofficial] fetches and converts [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and [[Google+]] data to and from Atom, as well as other formats like [[ActivityStreams]] and [[microformats2]] HTML/JSON.

* 2003-06-16 The effort to define a "conceptual data model of what constitutes a well formed log entry" blogged by Sam Ruby in <cite>[http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1472.html Anatomy of a Well Formed Log Entry]</cite> was the start of what became Atom.

=== Launch ===

=== RSS Atom wars ===
From 2003-2007 (at least) there was significant energy put into debating the merits of using [[Atom]] vs [[RSS]]. This quite heated ongoing debate earned the name of "<dfn>RSS Atom Wars</dfn>" or "<dfn>syndication wars</dfn>". A few articles during this time period help illustrate the tensions and conflicts:
* 2003-06-29 Perhaps the opening shots fired in what would become the RSS/Atom wars, this polite post by Ben Trott declaring the technical underpinnings for why an alternative to RSS was needed: [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801155433/http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2003/06/why-we-need-ech.html Why We Need Echo],
** The subsequent [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801155433/http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2003/06/why-we-need-ech.html#comments one polite defensive comment]
** And then as of the second comment the patronizing begins, and escalates into full on rudeness, strawmanning, expression of interpersonal dislike, personal attacks, and a darkly prescient prediction: <blockquote>This whole discussion leads to BigCo's stepping in and profiting from the community's weaknesses.</blockquote> They just had no idea that the BigCo's that would step in and profit from this weakness had yet to be founded ([[Facebook]], [[Twitter]]).
