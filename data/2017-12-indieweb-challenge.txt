The '''<dfn>IndieWeb Challenge</dfn>''' is to collectively ship something IndieWeb-related every day of December! Anyone can participate, and if you're looking for something to do, there's always '''[[to-do]]'''. This can be anything from editing wiki pages to shipping updates on any of the [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries].

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below!
