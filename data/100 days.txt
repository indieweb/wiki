A '''<dfn>100 days project</dfn>''' in the IndieWeb community is a challenge to do or make something and post about it on your own site every day for 100 days. The challenge can be started at any time, you commit to starting, and then make a post every day, typically with the #100Days tag (or a custom hashtag) on your personal website when you finish something for that day.

Each project can be as small as you want. Inspired by the [[#100DaysOfIndieWeb|100DaysOfIndieWeb]] project which was inspired by the [http://the100dayproject.com/ 100DayProject]: <blockquote><p>How do you start?<br/>Decide to do a 100 day project. Pick a start date -- and an ending date 100 days later. Then do one thing a day for 100 days (mornings are especially good).</p><p>Do something quick, creative, and do it without fear. Don't think too much, or better yet, don't think at all! See where it leads. </p></blockquote>

The only requirements for each 100 days project "thing" is:
* It must be something you did yourself.
* It must be something with a publicly visible result.

== How to ==
How to do a 100 days project:
* every day (before 10-11am ({{aaronpk}}'s approach))
* make or do something that you can immediately write about or publish
** It's okay if it's a super tiny thing! 
* When you finish, post it or about it, and tag it, e.g. <kbd>#100Days</kbd> (or a custom extension like <kbd>#100DaysOfIndieWeb</kbd>, see examples below).
** Optional: start post (name or content) with "Day N: " where N is 1 to 100, representing the day and post number for your "100 days of " series.

Project Page:
* Find some other way to collect all your posts into a page on your website or your wiki user page.
* If you have pages on your site that aggregates all your posts with a tag, then you already have a URL you can use to share your progress & results, though you may want a way to filter by year, or show a specific instance of a project if you do it more than once.
* You can also post a blog post summarizing / listing your 100 days posts to date.

== Brainstorming ==
=== More 100 days projects ===
Additional 100 days projects to consider:
==== Make and create ====
* '''100 days of blogging''' — actual [[article]] posts, not just notes, on specific atomic subjects
** obviously can build on any other 100 days project because you can blog about that day's project
* '''100 days of [[photo]]s''' — take and post a photo every day, can also build on any 100 days project that requires a photo
** '''100 days of positive [[photo]]s''' — post a positive photo as your first post in a day, for 100 days. Ok to also post negative / critical photos, just make sure the first photo you post on a day is positive.
* '''100 days of new IndieWeb wiki articles''' — create a new meaningful and [[wikify|appropriate]] article on the wiki that is directly relevant to the IndieWeb every day, and post a public [[note]] about it ([http://tantek.com/2019/003/t1/new-indieweb-page-monthly-recap like this]), inviting contributions from others!
** See '''[[to-do]]''' for ideas and ask in the #meta [[discuss]]ion channel for suggestions.
** Check '''[[Special:WantedPages|Wanted Pages]]''' (red links) and create them in apparent desired priority / number of links!
** Keep track of your additions, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days (i.e. not been deleted, merged, redirected, or otherwise removed). 
* '''100 days of new Wikipedia articles''' — create a new meaningful article about a notable subject (i.e. following all Wikipedia rules/guidelines) every day, and post a public [[note]] about it, inviting contributions from others!
** Check the '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Most-wanted_articles Wikipedia Most Wanted Articles]''' for topics you have have interest / expertise in
** Find a '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject Wikipedia WikiProject]''' that interests you and check their list of wanted pages
** Keep track of your new articles, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days (i.e. not been deleted, merged, redirected, or otherwise removed).
* '''100 days of docs''' — each day, create new shared public documentation for something like an open-source project or web standard, and post a public [[note]] about it, inviting contributions from others!
** Check open-source projects you use or have made for documentation requests
** Consider things you do or have figured out that aren't well-described somewhere else
** Keep track of your new docs, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days (i.e. not been deleted, merged, redirected, or otherwise removed).
* '''100 days of origami''' — make a different origami each day, and post a photo of it
* '''100 days of 10 origami cranes''' — make 10 origami peace cranes each day, and post a photo of the full set in progress, finishing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_origami_cranes 1000 origami cranes] in total

==== Reinforce the good ====
* '''100 days of positive news''' — find and post a link (citation) to a positive news article published that same day, to help counteract the [http://tantek.com/2016/042/t1/the-problem-to-solve-negative-news counterproductive impacts of negative news]
* '''100 days of IndieWeb wiki contributions''' 
* '''100 days of Wikipedia contributions''' — contribute at least one meaningful sentence or paragraph (or a whole article) to Wikipedia each day. Keep track of your additions, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days.
* '''100 days of docs''' — each day, improve documentation for something (could be open-source projects you use or have made, could be things you do or have figured out that aren't well-described somewhere else)
* '''100 days of yoga poses''' — do a different yoga pose each day, and post a photo of it
* '''100 days of listening''' — listening to audiobooks or podcasts? Could be something like listen to a podcast a day or 30 minutes of an audiobook a day. Then post a [[listen]] post
* '''100 days of following''' — Publish a [[note]] or a [[following]] post for one person each day that people should add to their readers.
* ...

If you consider yourself more an idea person than a builder:
* '''100 days of coming up with 100 days projects''' — post (or add, e.g. here in Brainstorming) a new specific 100 days project that seems at least reasonably feasible, perhaps something you might even do (on its own).
* ''''100 days of prompts''''- Each day post a challenge for others to complete. This could be a photo challenge, quotes to reflect on, or a writing prompt. 

If you have LOTS of time on your hands:
* '''100 days of starting 100 days projects''' — start a new 100 days project each day for 100 days. Yes that means on day 100 of this project you will be doing 100 *different* individual projects if you're able to keep up, then it will decrease by 1 each day until you're finished with the 100th day of the 100th project on day 199.

==== Let go of things and services ====
* '''100 days of discardia''' — donate, sell or otherwise get rid of some physical object in your life at least one per day. Keep a one in one out rule for any acquisitions which then don't count towards this goal so you keep reducing # of total objects each day.
* '''100 days of closing tabs''' — for those of us with >100 tabs open across our browsers, process/close (at least) one tab per day, and write about why you think you had it open, what action you took accordingly. Similarly, close any tabs you open during the project, and don't count those towards the goal.
* '''100 days of deleting accounts''' — delete one [[silo]] account a day (not counting any you sign-up for), post about it, and add it to [[silo-quits]].
** {{t}} seriously considering for 2018, though harder than deleting apps (would want to document data-retention policies, how to delete all silo data, screenshots etc.)
* '''100 days of deleting native apps''' — delete one native [[app]] a day from your ([[mobile]]) device, optionally replacing its usage with a web app, post about what you're deleting and what you're replacing it with, and add it to [[app-quits]].
** {{t}} seriously considering for 2018
** {{eddiehinkle.com}} planning to participate starting 2018-01-01
* '''100 days of unsubscribing from mailing lists''' — unsubscribe to one [[email-list]] every day and post about leaving it, why did you join the in the first place, why it no longer serves you or is no longer a priority. If you reach zero before 100 days are up you're done! Or if you reach zero optional ones, e.g., you're still subscribed to "required" lists for work.
* ...

==== Community contributions ====
* '''100 days of filing GitHub issues''' — file a new GitHub issue (either bug or feature request) on an open [[repo]] (OSS, web standards, personal sites etc.) a day (unique, novel issues, check for similar / duplicates first). Preferably across multiple projects, not just one project, and ideally 100 different projects!
* '''100 days of creating pull requests''' — submit a (GitHub) pull request that fixes a bug or adds a feature on an open [[repo]] (OSS, web standards, personal sites etc.) every day.

==== Regular maintenance ====
* '''100 days of changing passwords''' — instead of deleting accounts, change one ([[silo]]) account password a day (idea from {{aaronpk}} in chat, presumably no repeats). Not sure what the point of posting about it would be? To remind others to change their password on that site?

=== Previous Projects Started ===
* '''<span id="100 Days of 500 Words">100 Days of 500 Words</span>''' - write a post that is exactly 500 words (human language of choice) every day for 100 days.

=== Possible Start Dates ===
* Now

=== Other Durations ===
These may be deserving of a separate article themselves, or perhaps a more general "n days goal" page which links to and summarizes this page and the other (perhaps seasonal) durations.

==== 30 Days ====
If 100 days seems to intimidating, perhaps start with a smaller number like 30 days as a goal. E.g.
* [[2017-12-indieweb-challenge]]

* [[National Novel Writing Month]] (typically shortened NaNoWriMo) is a challenge to write a 50,000-word novel (or other extended work) in the month (30 days) of November.

==== 10 Days ====
* [https://10daysoftwitter.wordpress.com/about/ 10 Days of Twitter] or #10DoT is an online course which, in 10 minutes a day over 10 days, gets participants tweeting and building up your professional network. It was built for [[Indieweb_for_Education|educators and researchers]] to build work related networks on Twitter. (This could potentially be used as a model for gradually helping people set up their own online IndieWeb presences over the span of a few days' work.)

==== December and or 24 Days ====
24 days (first of December) is another pre-existing (if seasonal) duration of "do something every day". E.g.
