A '''<dfn>100 days project</dfn>''' in the IndieWeb community is representative of challenges to do or make something and post about it on your own site with some regularity (every day) and/or total completion number (like 100 posts) over a period of time like that same number of days or within a (calendar) year.

Inspired by the [[#100DaysOfIndieWeb|100DaysOfIndieWeb]] project which was inspired by the [http://the100dayproject.com/ 100DayProject]: <blockquote><p>How do you start?<br/>Decide to do a 100 day project. Pick a start date -- and an ending date 100 days later. Then do one thing a day for 100 days (mornings are especially good).</p><p>Do something quick, creative, and do it without fear. Don't think too much, or better yet, don't think at all! See where it leads. </p></blockquote>
__TOC__
== How to ==
How to do a 100 days or 100 posts/things project:

=== How to overview ===
* '''start''' a challenge at any time, and commit to starting
* '''make''' a thing, every day for 100Days challenges, or as often as you like for 100Posts or equivalent
* '''post''' on your personal site, when you finish something, on that same day for 100Days, typically with the #100Days tag (or equivalent or a custom hashtag)

Each project can be as small as you want. 

The only requirements for each project "thing" is:
* It must be something you did yourself
* It must be something with a publicly visible result

==== How to details ====
* '''make''' or do something that you can immediately write about or publish
** It's okay if it's a super tiny thing! 
* '''post it or about it''' when you finish it, and tag it, e.g. <kbd>#100Days</kbd> (or a custom extension like <kbd>#100DaysOfIndieWeb</kbd>, see examples below).
** Optional: start post (name or content) with "Day N: " where N is 1 to 100, representing the day and post number for your "100 days of " series.

==== How to 100 Days of IndieWeb ====
How to do 100 days of IndieWeb:
* '''every day''' (before 10-11am ({{aaronpk}}'s approach))
* '''make something indieweb-related''' that you will use immediately on your personal site ([[use what you make]])
* '''post a screenshot or video demonstrating''' the change to your website, and tag it with "100DaysOfIndieWeb" and "indieweb".
** Optional: start post (name or content) with "Day N: " where N is 1 to 100, representing the day and post number for your "100 days of " series.

If you have a page that aggregates all your posts with a tag, then you already have a URL you can use to share your results. Otherwise, find some other way to collect all your posts into a page on your website or your wiki user page.

=== How to make a project page ===
Project Page:
* Find some other way to collect all your posts into a page on your website or your wiki user page.
* If you have pages on your site that aggregates all your posts with a tag, then you already have a URL you can use to share your progress & results, though you may want a way to filter by year, or show a specific instance of a project if you do it more than once.
* You can also post a blog post summarizing / listing your 100 days posts to date.

== 100 days projects ==
The following 100 days indieweb projects have been successfully completed by at least one person! Feel free to try one of these or ask the people that did them what they thought of the experience!

=== 100 Days of IndieWeb ===
'''<dfn span id="100DaysOfIndieWeb">100DaysOfIndieWeb</dfn>''' is a challenge to ship something IndieWeb-related every day for 100 days. Make a post every day with the #100DaysOfIndieWeb tag on your personal website when you finish something for that day. Each project must be something you can demonstrate in a screenshot or video. Inspired by the [http://the100dayproject.com/ 100DayProject]: <blockquote><p>How do you start?<br/>Decide to do a 100 day project. Pick a start date -- and an ending date 100 days later. Then do one thing a day for 100 days (mornings are especially good).</p><p>Do something quick, creative, and do it without fear. Don't think too much, or better yet, don't think at all! See where it leads. </p></blockquote>

The only requirements for each indieweb "thing" is:
* It must be something [[selfdogfood|you use yourself]]
* It must be something with a publicly visible result (e.g. has a visible effect on the presentation of your web page, or is an improvement to an open source tool)

== Brainstorming ==
=== More 100 things projects ===
Since (nearly?) any set of "100" things can be done in a series of consecutive days or a total count over a period of time, and for any count like 7, 10, 31, 100 etc., these brainstorms focus on the thing, and not the regularity/frequency, and use "100" as a placeholder count, intended to be replaced by whatever count an individual wants to set as a goal.
==== Make and create ====
* '''100 posts''' â€” notes or any kind of [[posts]].
* '''100 articles''' â€” actual [[article]] posts, not just notes, on specific atomic subjects
** both this and the prior project can build on any other 100 things project because you can post about any projects items
* '''100 [[photo]]s''' â€” take and post a photo, can also build on any 100 things project that requires a photo
** '''100 positive [[photo]]s''' â€” post a positive photo as your first post of the day. Ok to also post negative / critical photos, just make sure the first photo you post on a day is positive.
* '''100 inventions''' â€” invent something new, or publish something you invented
* '''100 new IndieWeb wiki articles''' â€” create a new meaningful and [[wikify|appropriate]] article on the wiki that is directly relevant to the IndieWeb, and post a public [[note]] about it ([http://tantek.com/2019/003/t1/new-indieweb-page-monthly-recap like this]), inviting contributions from others!
** See '''[[to-do]]''' for ideas and ask in the #meta [[discuss]]ion channel for suggestions.
** Check '''[[Special:WantedPages|Wanted Pages]]''' (red links) and create them in apparent desired priority / number of links!
** Keep track of your additions, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days (i.e. not been deleted, merged, redirected, or otherwise removed).
* '''100 new Wikipedia articles''' â€” create a new meaningful article about a notable subject (i.e. following all Wikipedia rules/guidelines), and post a public [[note]] about it, inviting contributions from others!
** Check the '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Most-wanted_articles Wikipedia Most Wanted Articles]''' for topics you have have interest / expertise in
** Find a '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject Wikipedia WikiProject]''' that interests you and check their list of wanted pages
** Keep track of your new articles, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days (i.e. not been deleted, merged, redirected, or otherwise removed).
* '''100 new docs pages''' â€” create new shared public documentation for something like an open-source project or web standard, and post a public [[note]] about it, inviting contributions from others!
** Alternative to creating a new page/doc, provide a non-trivial contribution or update to an existing page (many OSS docs pages are stubs, or out of date just waiting for a volunteer)
** Check open-source projects you use or have made for documentation requests
** Consider things you do or have figured out that aren't well-described somewhere else
** Keep track of your new (or updated) docs, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days (i.e. not been deleted, merged, redirected, or otherwise removed), and do one more (day) for each one that got removed or merged (or reverted)
** Example: this wiki! https://indieweb.org/wikifying#How_to_Contribute_to_the_IndieWeb_Wiki
** Example: W3C wiki: https://www.w3.org/wiki/Main_Page
** Example: MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community
** Example: WikiMo: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Why_Contribute
* '''100 new productivity tips''' â€” productivity tips you came up with and use yourself, and their benefits to you, cite inspiration if related to a tip you saw/read elsewhere!
* '''100 new tidying or organizing tips''' - tidying or organizing tips you came up with and use yourself, and their benefits to you, cite inspiration if related to a tip you saw/read elsewhere!
* '''100 new habits or reinforcements''' - habits or methods for reinforcing habits you came up with and use yourself, and their benefits to you, cite inspiration if related to a tip you saw/read elsewhere!* '''100 origamis''' â€” make different origamis, and post photos of each one

* '''100 days of journaling''', e.g. journal in response to a prompt (from a meditation, from others)

If you consider yourself more an idea person than a builder:
* '''100 new 100 days projects''' â€” post (or add, e.g. here in [[#Brainstorming]]) a new specific 100 days project that seems at least reasonably feasible, perhaps something you might even do (on its own).
* ''''100 prompts''''- post a [[challenge]] for others to complete. This could be a photo challenge, quotes to reflect on, or a writing prompt. 

If you have LOTS of time on your hands:
* '''100 x 100 days projects''' â€” start 100 new 100 days project, one at a time (perhaps one each day for 100 days). E.g. as a 100 days project this means that on day 100 of this project you will be doing 100 *different* individual projects if you're able to keep up, then it will decrease by 1 each day until you're finished with the 100th day of the 100th project on day 199.

==== Reinforce the good ====
* '''100 posts of positive news''' â€” find and post a link (citation) to a positive news article published that same day, to help counteract the [http://tantek.com/2016/042/t1/the-problem-to-solve-negative-news counterproductive impacts of negative news]
* '''100 IndieWeb wiki contributions''' 
* '''100 Wikipedia contributions''' â€” contribute at least one meaningful sentence or paragraph (or a whole article) to Wikipedia. Keep track of your additions, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days.
* '''100 improved docs''' â€” improve documentation for something (could be open-source projects you use or have made, could be things you do or have figured out that aren't well-described somewhere else)
* '''100 HTML tags''' â€” post about an HTML tag, tips for using, what it means to you
* '''100 rel values''' â€” post about an existing rel value, how to use, how youâ€™ve used it
* '''100 microformats''' - post about an mf2 root or class property
* '''100 web standards (or related)''', post about a web standard, tips for using, relevance to you
* '''100 W3C happenings''', post about a W3C telecon or meeting, spec publication/advancement
* '''100 yoga poses''' â€” do different yoga poses, and post photos of them

Preferably across multiple projects, not just one project, and ideally 100 different projects!

* '''100 standards issues or fixes''' â€” scoped subset/combo of the GH issues / PRs items above, either pick a specific standard org or community (W3C, WHATWG, IETF, microformats.org, spec.indieweb.org) or across all of them, file an issue or make a proposal for resolving an issue or make a PR to help close/fix an existing issue

==== Regular maintenance ====
* '''100 changed passwords''' â€” instead of deleting accounts, change one ([[silo]]) account password a day (idea from {{aaronpk}} in chat, presumably no repeats). Not sure what the point of posting about it would be? To remind others to change their password on that site?

==== Let go of things and services ====
* '''100 discarded items''' â€” donate, sell or otherwise get rid of a physical object in your life. Keep a one in one out rule for any acquisitions which then don't count towards this goal so you keep continuously reducing the number of total objects.
* '''100 tabs processed and closed''' â€” for those of us with >100 tabs open across our browsers, process/close (at least) one tab at a time, and write about why you think you had it open, what action you took accordingly.

* '''100 deleted accounts''' â€” delete one [[silo]] account at a time (not counting any you sign-up for), post about it, and add it to [[silo-quits]].

* '''100 deleted native apps''' â€” delete one native [[app]] at a time from your ([[mobile]]) device, optionally replacing its usage with a web app, post about what you're deleting and what you're replacing it with, and add it to [[app-quits]].

** {{eddiehinkle.com}} planning to participate starting 2018-01-01
* '''100 unsubscribes from mailing lists''' â€” unsubscribe to a different [[email-list]] and post about leaving it, why did you join the in the first place, why it no longer serves you or is no longer a priority. If you reach zero before 100 days are up you're done! Or if you reach zero optional ones, e.g., you're still subscribed to "required" lists for work.
* ...

==== Self care ====
Pick something youâ€™d like to do as a beneficial habit, do it and then track / post about it each day!
* yoga
* meditation
* walking (pick a sustainable daily distance)
* "10k" steps a day (or a sustainable number for you, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109723064008?via%3Dihub ~8.8k/day, benefits up to 16k/day at least per 2023-10-10 study published in Journal of the American College of Cardiology], [https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/18/1975/7226309 up to 20k/day is correlated with reduced mortality per 2023-08-09 study published in European Journal of Preventive Cardiology], scroll down to graphs)
