''Main article: [[Webmention]]''.

== Implementation Details ==
There are some interesting implementation details regarding receiving webmentions. E.g. when to follow redirects and when not to.

=== endpoint discovery ===
In step 4 in the [[Webmention#Protocol_Summary|protocol summary]], when performing webmention endpoint discovery, implementations MUST check for the <code>webmention</code> and SHOULD check for <code><nowiki>http://webmention.org/</nowiki></code> (for backward compatiblity) as rel values which may be present among a space separated set of rel values inside a rel attribute.

Also note that endpoints may be advertised in both <code>&lt;link></code> and <code>&lt;a></code> elements. Supporting <code>&lt;a></code> is important for sites like [[WordPress#WordPress.com_hosting_service|WordPress.com]] that [http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/#html-tags don't allow link elements at all].

=== must follow redirects ===
In steps 7 and 8 in the [[Webmention#Protocol_Summary|protocol summary]], implementations MUST follow redirects of the target and source URLs.

=== checking target validity ===
In step 7 in the [[Webmention#Protocol_Summary|protocol summary]], when the webmention receiver checks the <code>target</code> URL for validity, follow any HTTP redirects and use the resulting URL when checking for validity.

For example, if your posts visibly show permashortlinks for others to copy/cite/link to and someone sends a webmention to a shortlink, be sure to resolve any redirects before checking if itâ€™s on your site, or matching it up to a post on your site.

The webmention receiver should then check if the <code>target</code> is valid and supported. A valid target is one that is recognized by the receiver. 

In simple cases, this is just a check that the target URL exists on the receiver's domain. The meaning of "valid" can be extended to also include:
* mentions of pages that don't exist on your site (in case you want to track possible lost URLs)
* mentions of POSSE URLs

==== use cases ====
* Webmention proxy servers such as [[webmention.io]] and [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com] are able to accept webmentions for other people's sites
* Enables indieweb-[[friendly]] silos to send [[backfeed]] webmentions for comments and responses to the original post of a POSSE copy on that silo.
** i.e. if you POSSE to a silo, you should accept webmentions where the target is your POSSE copy
** This requires indieweb-friendly silos send webmentions to the original site's webmention endpoint, so the silo will need to know that one of its posts is a POSSE copy


You should also support receiving webmentions where the <code>target</code> is one of your POSSE copies.

=== verifying source links to target ===
In step 8 in the [[Webmention#Protocol_Summary|protocol summary]], as the webmention receiver, to verify the <code>source</code> URL:
* retrieve it following redirects,
* when checking the resultant HTML, look for the <code>target</code> URL as '''literally provided in the webmention request''' (i.e. NOT redirects from <code>target</code>)

For example, if you get a webmention with <code>source=http://short.me/t100 target=http://example.com/notes/5</code>:
* Fetch <code>source=http://short.me/t100</code> following any redirects until you get an HTML document
* Search the resulting HTML for <code>a</code> elements with a href value of '''exactly''' <code>http://example.com/notes/5</code>, as given in the <code>target</code> parameter

=== sync or async response status code ===
Webmention receivers can choose to verify the webmention synchronously (process immediately) or asynchronously (add it to a queue for processing later). High level difference:

Synchronously:
* upon successful verification the receiver MUST return a '''HTTP 200 Success''' response

Asynchronously:
* receiver MUST return '''HTTP 202 Accepted'''.

See the [[Webmention-brainstorming|brainstorming section]] for some additional thinking on this.

=== types of mentions ===
In addition to just a link (mention) there are several special types of mentions, each which have markup for detection and specific implementation recommendations:
* [[reply]] (via [[in-reply-to]]) 
** [[RSVP]] a special kind of reply to an event, indicating where or not attending (or maybe/interested)
* [[like]]
* [[repost]]

=== accessing endpoints in the browser ===
Some implementations now display a page that briefly explains webmentions when the webmention endpoint is accessed in a browser.
