To '''<dfn>read</dfn>''' or <dfn>reading</dfn> is the act of viewing and interpreting [[posts]] or other documents; on the IndieWeb, a '''read post''' expresses that something has been read, like a book or section thereof. This could serve as a way to share books etc. with followers, or to notify the author of a document that you have read it (if the document can receive webmentions).

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} is experimenting with posting reading progress check-ins as of 2015-01-25:
* Start: http://gregorlove.com/2015/01/on-page-0-of-309-1/ (created later, backdated)
* In-progress: http://gregorlove.com/notes/2015/01/25/1/
* Finished: http://gregorlove.com/2015/02/on-page-309-of-309-1/

Notes:
* Currently using <code>p-page</code> and <code>p-total</code> to indicate progress. The percentage complete can be calculated and [[graphed]] from these values.
* Using <code>h-item</code> and <code>u-identifier</code> for the book title. The identifier's href is in the format <code>ISBN:XXXXX</code>.
* Manually [[POSSE]] to [[Goodreads]].
* Feedback is welcome, since this may not be the "best" way.

=== rhiaro ===
{{rhiaro}} displays read posts since [http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/08/1438731932 2015-08-04]. These are different to bookmarks, as I expicitly mean bookmarks as to-read or to-read-again. I expect to add notes (content) to read posts in the future, too. Marked up with the made-up microformat <code>u-read-of</code>.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} is experimenting with posting "read" posts as plaintext [[notes]] of a specific format, starting with "read ", (smart)quoted name of the work, optionally part of what larger work, "by ", name or @-name of author, punctuation of some sort with additional contextual remarks or commentary. Examples:
* http://tantek.com/2015/360/t4/read-arsebestos-some-remarks-hardcopy <blockquote>read “Arsebestos” in “Some Remarks” #hardcopy by @nealstephenson, while lying sideways.</blockquote>
* with book URL/ISBN: http://tantek.com/2015/360/t5/read-slashdot-interview-some-remarks <blockquote>read “Slashdot Interview” in “Some Remarks” by @nealstephenson. #hardcopy tantek.com/isbn/0062024442</blockquote>
* “started” with emoji and URL: http://tantek.com/2016/001/t5/started-reading-the-artist-way <blockquote>📕 started reading “The Artist’s Way” by Julia Cameron. tantek.com/isbn/1585421464</blockquote>
* “finished” with 3rd emoji, URL, Previously: http://tantek.com/2016/002/t1/finished-reading-halo-first-strike <blockquote>📘 finished reading “Halo: First Strike” by Eric Nylund, tantek.com/isbn/0345467817. <br/>Previously: 📕 “Halo: The Fall of Reach” by Eric Nylund, tantek.com/isbn/0345451325.</blockquote>

Will likely only post when I've finished reading a complete "chunk" of a work, a named section or numbered chapter perhaps.

== Other Examples ==
Other interesting or notable examples of people posting about reading on the web, perhaps lists of books they have read, perhaps on another site but not on a "read" post silo.

As clusters of interesting behavior emerge here, they may be worthy of labeling and their own pages, e.g. "personal library", "owned books", "books to read" etc.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} keeps a list of books he has read and would like to read:

=== Tantek thoughts ===
Some thoughts from having experimented with a couple of "read" posts (see [[#Tantek|above]]).

* [[text-first design]] - here's a modest design for the plain text versions of "read" posts (suitable to get started with posting on your own site, and [[POSSE]]ing to text-primary destinations like [[Twitter]].
** simple: <samp>📕 read “</samp>{name-of-work}<samp>” by </samp>{name or @-name of author}<samp>.</samp>
** chapter/section: <samp>📖 read “</samp>{name-number-of-section-chapter}<samp>” in “</samp>{name-of-work}<samp>” by </samp>{name or @-name of author}<samp>.</samp>

The terminating period (<samp>.</samp>) in each example could be any punctuation, other sentence terminators (!), or a comma(,) indicating commentary afterwards.

* continuing with the design, some optional aspects following the above
** [[hashtags]], e.g. 
*** <samp>#hardcopy</samp> indicating something was read in physical printed (on paper) form.
** {URL} to the work itself online, or an online representation of a physical product
** other commentary
** terminating with a [[permashortlink]] or [[permashortcitation]].

Details of terminology used in text-first design:
;read
:meaning I started and finished reading it in close temporal proximity
;started reading (note [https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%22started%20reading%22&src=typd Twitter search/usage])
;finished reading (haven't used yet, but thinking about)
:meaning I started reading this sometime in the past (days, months, years? ago), and just now finished reading it.
;in
:indicates section/chapter as part of some larger work. any following information (hashtags, URLs) apply to the larger work
;by
:prefix indicating author information follows, either as an @-name, or Capitalized Full Name

Considering:
* a leading emoji at the start like the musical note for [[jam]] posts, e.g.
** 📕📗📘📙📚📖
* perhaps separate emoji for particular sub-types of read posts, e.g.
** 📕 started reading / read / finished reading a whole book - good default. when you start you’re about to open the book, and when you finish, you’ve closed the book.
** 📗 ... a whole book that is second in a series
** 📘 ... third in a series
** 📙 ... fourth in a series
** 📚 ... a trilogy / set of books
** 📖 read / finished reading a section or chapter of a book, or perhaps just even up to a page number, but have not yet finished the book.
** ...

=== Read Receipts ===
{{main|read receipt}}
A read post in reply to a [[message]], from one of the recipients of that message, is a read ''receipt'' of that message.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Goodreads ===
* [[Goodreads]] allows you to check-in your reading progress.

=== Facebook ===
* [[Facebook]] allows you to choose 'Reading' as an activity and pick a book/article from its drop down, or type in free text, as part of updating your status.

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] does not have any explicit "reading" activity or post, however people post tweets that resemble "read" posts, e.g.:

* 2016-02-13 https://twitter.com/blithe/status/698605025493266432 <blockquote>Finished reading Salvage the Bones: A Novel by Jesmyn Ward http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005IQ2D9W</blockquote>

== Articles ==
Articles about reading on the web:
* 2014-02-14 CNET: [http://www.cnet.com/news/news-flash-people-rarely-read-before-tweeting-stories/ News flash: People rarely read before tweeting stories]
