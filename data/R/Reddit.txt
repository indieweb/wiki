{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://www.reddit.com/ Reddit]</dfn>''' is a link [[aggregator]] and bulletin board site where community members may submit links and text posts, vote on the submitted entries, and post comments on them. As community members vote a post up or down, the site determines how to position a post within the news feed.

Because of the upvote / downvote system, Reddit is an effective crowd-sourced curation tool where the "best" links (as determined by a particular subreddit's users) are pushed to the top. As a result, sites that have been pushed to Reddit's front page experience huge surges in traffic (also known as "the Slashdot Effect").

== Features ==
The features below are only available to Reddit community members:

* Vote posts up or down to determine their position in the site feed
* Deeply-threaded comment system
* The ability to create your own category pages (called "subreddits")

== How to export ==
(stub)

Anyone know how to export your posts and comments from Reddit?

Into what format?

* Reddit has an API that returns data in JSON or XML. [http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_user_%7Busername%7D_about.json] <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/assets/img/profile.jpg}} [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 16:13, 22 July 2015 (PDT)
* Reddit also puts out RSS and JSON feeds for various portions
** example: RSS feed for https://www.reddit.com/r/example/ is https://www.reddit.com/r/example.rss and JSON would be https://www.reddit.com/r/example.json
* There are also RSS and JSON feeds for private feeds, private profile pages, and various parts of one's inbox that are available at: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/feeds/

=== Basic Reddit Content Exporter (Reddit to JSON, runs in-browser) ===

I ({{template:danq}}) have implemented a block of Javascript that you can use to export all of your Reddit comments, posts, gildings, upvoted-things etc. as a huge block of JSON. It runs in your browser to <strike>exploit</strike> make use of your Reddit cookie rather than using a modhash. As a result, it's best for one-off bulk exports rather than ongoing-PESOS: however, it could easily be adapted. It can also be used to export ''other people's'' data, but it'll only get that which is visible to the user you're logged-in as (e.g. it won't get their posts in subreddits you're not a member of, it won't get their upvotes unless they've opted-in to sharing that data, etc.).

Get it at '''https://gist.github.com/Dan-Q/1129e91db2c74cdd0c057b477702bfca'''. Instructions are at the top.
