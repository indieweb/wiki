Many silos offer [[RSS]] feeds for different kinds of content, but the details are not always easy to find. This page lists examples for some silos. Feel free to add more.

[[RSS#Projects | Projects]] on the RSS page links to other tools that off alternate means of re-enabling RSS feeds that silos may have shut down.

=== [[deviantArt]] === 

http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=gallery%3AUSERNAME.

"gallery:" becomes "gallery%3A" due to the URL encoding; only replace the USERNAME with the deviantArt username.

=== [[Flickr]] ===
To get the feed of a single person use:
https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?lang=en-us&format=rss_200&id=USERID.

Unfortunately, the USERID is not the username, and to get the actual ID you either need to need to use the Flickr API or visit a 3rd party service, like http://idgettr.com/.
At least you can specify set IDs as well to follow, the details are at https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/.

There is also a way to get the feed of everyone you follow:
https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_friends.gne?lang=en-us&format=rss_200&id=USERID
but in this case, USERID should be your own ID.

There is a documentation on this at https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/.

=== [[Instagram]] ===
Only through 3rd party [http://websta.me], but it works.
