=== Dan Lyke ===
{{danlyke}}'s site flutterby.com has an RSS 1.0 (RDF) feed at http://www.flutterby.com/main.rdf 

=== Jason Garber ===
{{jgarber}} publishes auto-discoverable RSS 2.0 feeds using [[FrancisCMS]] on [https://sixtwothree.org sixtwothree.org] since 2016-01-14 for each content type:
* https://sixtwothree.org/posts.rss
* https://sixtwothree.org/links.rss
* https://sixtwothree.org/photos.rss

=== Known ===
All [[Known]] sites provide an RSS 2.0 feed for any page or feed by adding ?_t=rss to the URL. e.g. 
* {{benwerd}} on http://werd.io/?_t=rss

=== Malcolm Blaney ===
[[User:Unicyclic.com_mal|Malcolm]]'s site unicyclic.com provides RSS feeds for new posts and comments. It also supports [[rssCloud]] to register for updates. Any feed will only show updates for the last 24 hours, with the expectation being that subscribers and aggregators will store historical content if they want to. A period of 24 hours was chosen so that feed items could be edited by the author and re-syndicated.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}}'s [[WordPress]] [http://www.boffosocko.com site] provides the standard RSS feeds for both posts and comments. In late 2016, I added and [http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/18/rss-feeds-a-follow-up-on-my-indieweb-commitment-2017/ documented] some additional human readable feeds for common indieweb post types as well. These are also done so that feed readers scraping the site will be able to offer these options to potential subscribers. I did this particularly as with increasing varieties of content and content types on my site, I don't expect that everyone will necessarily want the "firehose" feed, but may prefer to read subsections of content by post types, categories, or tags. I was also able to add links to RSS feeds from other sites I own as well to make my personal homepage a more central hub for my content.
