<dfn>River4</dfn> is an [[RSS]] aggregator written by [http://scripting.com Dave Winer]. The project is written in node.js and open source[https://github.com/scripting/river4]. In contrast to other styles of feed reader, it produces a "River of News" characterized by[http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html]:

== Features ==
* entries have a title, summary, and link.
* rivers group articles from the same source together
* no "unread" counts, just a vertically arranged list of feeds sorted reverse chronologically

River4 stores data on the user's local system or on Amazon S3, decoupling the reader web app from the server/datastore. Another feature of River4 is that multiple rivers, or groups of RSS feeds, can be presented on the same web site through a tab interface.

The specification  for the river format is at [http://riverjs.org/ RiverJS.org]
