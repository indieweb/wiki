* [https://boffosocko.com/2021/12/20/55799844/ 2021-12-20] {{chrisaldrich}} used a Rocketbook notebook in conjunction with [[IFTTT]] and [[Micropub]] to publish an [[article]] to his website.

* As described in [https://boffosocko.com/2021/12/20/55799844/ Handwriting my Website with a Digital Amanuensis] 
<blockquote>The bottom of each page of the [Rocketbook notebook] has seven different faint icon images which are meant to allow the app to determine where to send the digital copy of the notes. One can send them via email or to a variety of storage or sharing services. I could imagine having different recipes set up to allow one to publish their notes to different websites based on the icon X-ed out. Given the [[micropub]] possibilities, one could also use the icons as a means of differentiating [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post kinds]] (for example, indicating that a particular post is a [[note]], an [[article]], or a [[bookmark]]). Another alternate idea would be to use the icons as a means of selecting which services to [[:Category:syndication|syndicate]] your content to (for example, the diamond could mean syndicate this post to Micro.blog, the bell could mean Mastodon, and the clover syndicates the post to Twitter).</blockquote>
