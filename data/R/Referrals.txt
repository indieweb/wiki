referrals are a form of [[advertising]] where people share links to products and services they recommend. Often companies will provide financial incentives for referrals in the form of discounts, commissions, and free products.

== IndieWeb Examples
* {{toby3d}} has a [https://toby3d.me/en/referrals/ /referrals] page
* {{aciccarello}} is considering adding a /referrals page for services that he already uses

== Silo Examples ==
* Instagram influencers sharing "swipe up for link" recommendations

== Benefits ==
* Referrals tend to be seen as a more trustworthy form of advertising due to trust in the people referring products
* Referral links don't rely on user data for targeting

== Criticism ==
* Some blogs with titles like "10 products for X" provide little value and are only focused on monetization
* Referral incentives may sway a person's judgement
* Product referrals may have been minimally vetted
