'''<dfn>Raspberry Pi</dfn>''' is an inexpensive computer board popular among hobbyists.

IndieWeb community members hosting their sites on a Raspberry Pi device!

{{j4y_funabashi}} is hosting his site j4y.co on a Raspberry Pi since 2016-03-20!

I was using my raspberry pi as a local version of my site anyway and I started wondering how easy it would be to use that instead of my hosting provider (who could turn evil / lose my data)
After a bit of research I found that it would be relatively simple, all I had to do was:

* login to my router
* forward port 80
* point my domain at my external IP address.

So now all my data is stored on a pi in my house, which is periodically backed up to an external hard drive (also planning to backup offsite to s3) which feels great!

If anyone needs help setting this up for themselves I would be glad to help you figure it out (though I am certainly not an expert!)
