'''<dfn>Rust</dfn>''' is an open source system [[programming language]] by [[Mozilla]], with one or more libraries that support various IndieWeb [[building blocks]].

== Microformats Library ==

Two libraries for the [https://crates.io/crates/microformats parser] and [https://crates.io/crates/microformats-types types] allow for browser-grade parsing of HTML to render Microformat documents. It has an optional extension to rewrite the HTML as it's parsed to identity specific Microformat properties in JSON to a particular element, making debugging a bit easier. It also uses this to provide a sample specification validation server so you can visually see what elements conform to the expectation of a [[h-card]], [[h-entry]] and other elements.

== IndieWeb Utility Library ==
The objectives of [https://crates.io/crates/indieweb the Rust library] is to provide conforming implementations of the following:

* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[Webmention]]
* [[Micropub]] and supported [[Micropub-extensions|extensions]]
* [[Microsub]]
* [[WebSub]]

as well as the following [[algorithms]]:

* [[representative h-card]] parsing
* [[authorship]] parsing
* [[original post discovery]]

The project at https://git.sr.ht/~jacky/indieweb-rust/ also provide examples of the use of the library by implementing:

* A sample [[IndieAuth]] client that can be run locally,
* A [[Webmention]] server that has a demonstrative implementation of [[Vouch]],
* A [[WebSub]] and [[Microsub]] server and client demonstration of how they can be used together, implementing a in-memory [[reader]]
* A [[Micropub]] server using an SQLite database to handle searching and structure of [[microformats]] data
