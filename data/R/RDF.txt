{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDF</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Resource Description Format, an early-ish part of XML-related technology, that was pitched as the Semantic Web, used in [[Trackback]] and [[RSS]] 1.0 (but dropped by [[Pingback]] and RSS 2.0 respectively), later rebranded as Linked Data, experimentally published in the past, but not used by any indieweb use-cases in practice. 

[[Microformats]] began in part as a reaction against the verbosity of RDF and extra technical layers. RDF developers eventually took some tips from Microformats in turn, and created [[RDFa]] and [[JSON-LD]].

== Criticisms ==
=== complexity without benefit ===
The additional conceptual and implementation complexity costs of learning/coding RDF do not provide equivalent (or any in practice?) marginal benefit (certainly not to individual developers who have limited time/maintenance resources for their own websites):

=== syllogisms not useful ===

=== provokes emotional ranting ===
For some reason, RDF and Semantic Web in general provoke strong negative emotional reactions from at least some developers:
