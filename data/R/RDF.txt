{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDF</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Resource Description Format, an early-ish part of XML-related technology, that was pitched as the Semantic Web, used in [[Trackback]] and [[RSS]] 1.0 (but dropped by [[Pingback]] and RSS 2.0 respectively), later rebranded as Linked Data, experimentally published in the past, but not used by any indieweb use-cases in practice. 

[[Microformats]] began in part as a reaction against the verbosity of RDF and extra technical layers. RDF developers eventually took some tips from Microformats in turn, and created [[RDFa]] and [[JSON-LD]].

== Example Uses ==
=== FOAF ===
FOAF (Friend of a Friend) is (was?) one of the more frequently used RDF vocabularies/formats, in many ways a reinvention of the [[vCard]] vocabulary (used in [[hCard]] [[microformats]] and [[h-card]] [[microformats2]]).

From this wiki (from IndieWeb community experience), FOAF was also:
* [[2011/undiscussed|undiscussed at the original IndieWebCamp 2011]]
* [[events/2014-10-15-hwc-lisbon/|briefly mentioned at HWC 2014-10-15 in Lisbon]]
* [[2014/indie-contacts|mentioned in the Indie Contacts session at IndieWebCamp 2014]]
* an example of the [[sidefile-antipattern]]
* indexed by the now defunct [[social_graph#Google_Social_Graph_API|Google Social Graph API]]
* an example of [[past standards efforts]]
* noted as "dead" in the [[2019/sots#Dead|IndieWeb Summit 2019 State of the Suite (of Protocols) session]]

The general concept of a "friend of a friend" affording some trust (at least to leave comments) is used in the [[Vouch]] protocol.

== Criticisms ==
=== complexity without benefit ===
The additional conceptual and implementation complexity costs of learning/coding RDF do not provide equivalent (or any in practice?) marginal benefit (certainly not to individual developers who have limited time/maintenance resources for their own websites): 
* From: http://microformats.org/wiki/triples <blockquote>The larger problem is that triples are more than just complicated, they are unnecessarily complicated.</blockquote>

=== syllogisms not useful ===
* syllogisms critique http://www.shirky.com/writings/herecomeseverybody/semantic_syllogism.html

=== provokes emotional ranting ===
For some reason, RDF and Semantic Web in general provoke strong negative emotional reactions from at least some developers:

** "To be honest, I haven't yet seen a convincing case for the Semantic Web.  Of course this could be because I'm some kind of unimaginative subliterate ... but ... (and I'm only putting this out here!) ... could it be that it doesn't solve a lot of problems people actually have?" [https://www.facebook.com/YungTseTech @YungTseTech] May 7, 2019

* Criticism: '''Difficult to use and poor DX''': From the [[AT Protocol]] FAQ: [https://atproto.com/guides/faq#why-create-lexicon-instead-of-using-json-ld-or-rdf Why create Lexicon instead of using JSON-LD or RDF?] <blockquote><p>RDF is intended for extremely general cases in which the systems share very little infrastructure. It’s conceptually elegant but difficult to use, often adding a lot of syntax which devs don't understand. … </p><p>We looked very closely at using RDF but just didn't love the DX or the tooling it offered.</p></blockquote>
* To-do: incorporate "Criticism" in See Also section into Criticism section with new subheads as needed.
