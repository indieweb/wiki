{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDF</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Resource Description Format, an early-ish part of XML-related technology, that was pitched as the Semantic Web, used in [[Trackback]] and [[RSS]] 1.0 (but dropped by [[Pingback]] and RSS 2.0 respectively), later rebranded as Linked Data, experimentally published in the past, but not used by any indieweb use-cases in practice. 

[[Microformats]] began in part as a reaction against the verbosity of RDF and extra technical layers. RDF developers eventually took some tips from Microformats in turn, and created [[RDFa]] and [[JSON-LD]].
