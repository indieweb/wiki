{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDF</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Resource Description Format, an early-ish part of the XML development efforts that became known as the Semantic Web, and later Linked Data. [[Microformats]] began in part as a reaction against the verbosity of RDF and extra technical layers. RDF developers eventually took some tips from Microformats in turn, and created [[RDFa]] and [[JSON-LD]]. These newer formats come across to the untrained eye as less academically obsessive.
