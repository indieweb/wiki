{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDF</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Resource Description Format, an early-ish part of XML-related technology, that was pitched as the Semantic Web, used in [[Trackback]] and [[RSS]] 1.0 (but dropped by [[Pingback]] and RSS 2.0 respectively), later rebranded as Linked Data, experimentally published in the past, but not used by any indieweb use-cases in practice. 

[[Microformats]] began in part as a reaction against the verbosity of RDF and extra technical layers. RDF developers eventually took some tips from Microformats in turn, and created [[RDFa]] and [[JSON-LD]].

== Criticisms ==
=== complexity without benefit ===
The additional conceptual and implementation complexity costs of learning/coding RDF do not provide equivalent (or any in practice?) marginal benefit (certainly not to individual developers who have limited time/maintenance resources for their own websites):

=== syllogisms not useful ===

=== provokes emotional ranting ===
For some reason, RDF and Semantic Web in general provoke strong negative emotional reactions from at least some developers:

** "To be honest, I haven't yet seen a convincing case for the Semantic Web.  Of course this could be because I'm some kind of unimaginative subliterate ... but ... (and I'm only putting this out here!) ... could it be that it doesn't solve a lot of problems people actually have?" [https://www.facebook.com/YungTseTech @YungTseTech] May 7, 2019
