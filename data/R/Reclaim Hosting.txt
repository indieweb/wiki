'''<dfn>[https://reclaimhosting.com/ Reclaim Hosting]</dfn>''' is a [[web hosting]] company focused on the education sector to provide educators and instutitions an easy way to offer their students domains and web hosting that they own and control.

Their [[tagline]] "Take Control of your Digital Identity" is a fundamental restatement of IndieWeb philosophy.

The company grew out of the [[A Domain of One's Own]] project at University of Mary Washington and is headed by early IndieWeb proponents [http://jimgroom.net/about/ Jim Groom] and [https://blog.timowens.io/ Tim Owens].

== Services ==
Among many standard offerings, they provide [[domain registration]], [[web hosting]], and one click installation of many popular [[CMS]] [[projects]] including [[Known]], [[WordPress]], [[Drupal]], [[Omeka]], and [[MediaWiki]].

== Domains Conferences ==
They sponsor occasional conferences (eg: [http://domains.reclaimhosting.com/ Domains '17]) aimed at academia focused around independent and open source tools for education and the [[A Domain of One's Own]]. Past topics have included:
* The Web as Portfolio
* Digital Identity
* Online Scholarly Presence
* A Digital Humanities Toolkit
* A discussion on how one administers a Domain of One’s Own project in their community.
* Getting to Know cPanel
* What Works?
* What Doesn’t?

== Nota bene ==

<blockquote>"hi tim! honestly, if BitNinja is indiscriminately blacklisting huge swathes of IP blocks like Google Cloud's, that seems extremely aggressive to me. i expect it's also blacklisting many others too, and probably affecting many legitimate users, both automated (like Bridgy) and human. i'd maybe take a look at whether they're really necessary, and if you truly think they are preventing some concrete harm, whether there's another way to avoid it.
IndieWeb in particular expects HTTP requests from other web servers to work (for webmentions, etc) as well as from humans. if BitNinja is aggressively blocking "bots," that often translates to any server, period, which will materialy harm IndieWeb interop.
as concrete examples besides Bridgy, a number of other IndieWeb community members run sites and services on Google Cloud, including @aaronpk (telegraph, watchtower, ownyourgram), @kevinmarks (mention.tech, others), and more." [https://github.com/snarfed @snarfed] September 5, 2019</blockquote>

* As of 6/6/2022, they have no plans to change from BitNinja or take steps to prevent (intermittent) than blocking of large portions of Google Cloud Platform. Their recommended solution is to move from Shared Hosting to [https://reclaim.cloud/ Cloud Hosting]
