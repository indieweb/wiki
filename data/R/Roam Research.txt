'''<dfn>Roam Research</dfn>''' (aka '''<dfn>Roam</dfn>''') is a [[silo]] that functions as a personal [[wiki]], to do list, digital notebook, or [[commonplace book]]. It can either be public or private and thus could be used as the basis for a website, though there isn't a way to map a [[personal domain]] name onto the service.

In early 2020, Roam was free while in beta; in 2021 the company charges $13-15 per month for its service. It is similar to software like [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Evernote]], [[OneNote]] and other products.

== Features ==
Among many common website features, Roam has the ability to:
* [[tag]] or categorize content
* provide [[backlinks]] (or bi-directional links) between pieces of content
* provides a mind map view of links between pieces of content

== Alternatives ==
{{main|commonplace book#Platforms}}

[https://github.com/foambubble/foam Foam] is an open source tool "inspired by Roam Research" built on Visual Studio Code (used to edit the content) and GitHub - including the possibility to publish the content to GitHub pages.
