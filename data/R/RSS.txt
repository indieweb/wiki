https://indieweb.org/RSS

'''<dfn>RSS</dfn>''' is a set of XML [[feed file]] formats of varying degrees of use for syndicating time-stamped content from web sites, and sometimes used to refer more broadly to [[feed file]] formats as a whole including [[Atom]], or even more broadly in vernacular as a synonym for feed file or even feeds or syndication as a concept. <abbr>RSS</abbr> is an acronym that stands for: Rich Site Summary (originally RDF Site Summary, often dubbed Really Simple Syndication)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS]. [[Atom]] is an alternative XML format for [[feeds]].

RSS formats are fairly widely used, from news sites to blogs (both self-hosted and services/silos), through e-commerce or classified sites such as Craigslist, though there have been [[#Shutdowns|shutdown]]s in recent years.

See [[feed file]] for a list of RSS formats and those often lumped in with RSS.

==  IndieWeb examples ==

[[RSS/IndieWeb_examples | IndieWeb Examples]] Many people use RSS to share content from their websites. Some people feel that other forms of feed are more useful.

== Projects ==
In response to social silos turning off or removing access to their RSS Feeds, some groups have created work-arounds or alternate means of re-enabling RSS feeds. Some of these are listed below:
* {{snarfed}}'s [https://github.com/snarfed/granary granary] fetches and converts [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and [[Google+]] data to and from RSS, as well as other formats like [[ActivityStreams]] and [[microformats2]] HTML/JSON.

* https://twitter-atom.appspot.com/
* https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/
* https://instagram-atom.appspot.com/
* https://plusstreamfeed.appspot.com/

== Silo Examples ==
=== [[Flickr]] ===
To get the feed of a single person use:
https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?lang=en-us&format=rss_200&id=USERID.

Unfortunately, the USERID is not the username, and to get the actual ID you either need to need to use the Flickr API or visit a 3rd party service, like http://idgettr.com/.
At least you can specify set IDs as well to follow, the details are at https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/.

There is also a way to get the feed of everyone you follow:
https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_friends.gne?lang=en-us&format=rss_200&id=USERID
but in this case, USERID should be your own ID.

There is a documentation on this at https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/.

=== [[deviantArt]] === 

http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=gallery%3AUSERNAME.

"gallery:" becomes "gallery%3A" due to the URL encoding; only replace the USERNAME with the deviantArt username.

=== [[Tumblr]] === 

http://USERNAME.tumblr.com/rss

===  [[WordPress]] === 

WordPress ( both .com and hosted sites ) nearly always have RSS feeds for the site, for the categories, the tags; even for comments, sitewise and per entry. More details [https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds here].

Examples:
;full site feed
:http://USERNAME.wordpress.com/comments/feed
;full comments feed
:http://USERNAME.wordpress.com/comments/feed
;category feed
:http://USERNAME.wordpress.com/category/CATEGORYNAME/feed
;post specific comments feed
:http://USERNAME.wordpress.com/URL/TO/THE/POST/feed
;post kind feed with single taxonomy (post kind pages are archives)
:https://mywebsite.com/kind/photo/feed
;post kind feed with more than one taxonomy
:https://mywebsite.com/kind/photo,note/feed
;post kind feed with a tag
:https://example.com/feed/?kind=reply&tag=TAGNAME

=== [[Blogspot.com]] ===

=== [[Instagram]] ===

=== [[last.fm]] ===

For other feeds, like loved tracks, see [http://www.last.fm/api/feeds].


== Autodiscovery ==
RSS feeds can be automatically discovered by feed readers if the homepage contains a link to it in its head:

 <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="/feed.xml"/>

The title is important if there are multiple feeds linked, e.g. category and comment feeds.

== Issues ==
=== Problems Consuming RSS ===
There are many known problems consuming RSS feeds. See [[feed#Criticism]] for an extensive listing.

=== Ambiguous Usage ===
Use of the term "RSS" in conversation, whether online or in-person, has been ambiguously and interchangeably used to mean:
* RSS 2.0 in particular (implying all other versions of RSS aren't actually RSS, or are ignorable, or both)
* RSS feed files of any version
* RSS feed files of any version AND Atom feed files of any version
* as a synonym for a feed file of any format

=== Items appearing as new again ===
When the [[GUID]] for an item in an RSS feed changes, old items that have already been read will appear again as new. With a [[podcast]] feed, this means software will try to download episodes you've already listened to again.

{{gRegor}}: I've experienced this several times with podcast feeds. Some of the feeds have 50 episodes in them, so suddenly my podcast software is trying to queue up a lot of episodes I've already heard, and I have to manually remove them.

== Praise ==
Praise for RSS, example uses:

== Criticisms ==
=== Causes Plumbing Misfocus ===
Discussion of RSS in the context of indieweb or openweb etc. typically causes everyone involved in such communication to shift their thinking / conversation to be [[plumbing]]-centric (since RSS is a format, not a user feature), instead of user-centric.

This is at the opportunity cost of discussing actual user-level features, such the features and levels in [[IndieMark]], and against generally agreed upon IndieWeb [[principles]], in particular:
* '''UX and [[design]] are more important than protocols and formats.'''

Solution: refocus the discussion on use-cases.

When someone asks "Why don't you support RSS?" or requests "Please use RSS":

Ask them, "What's the use case you're trying to solve?"

Then document the use-case, and how you're solving it with [[building blocks]] on your own website.

And keep the discussion focused on use-cases, rather than [[plumbing]].

See [[proof of work]] for some techniques to keep discussion focused on [[UX]], use-cases, and other indieweb [[principles]]

=== Feed File Criticisms ===
{{main|feed_file#Criticism}}
RSS variants are all [[feed file]]s, thus all the [[feed_file#Criticism|feed file criticisms]] apply as well.

== Alternative ==
Instead of publishing/consuming RSS:
* Publish [[h-entry]] in your HTML. See https://indieweb.org/ for more
* Consume [[h-entry]], e.g. with a [[microformats2]] parser
* Use a tool like [[unmung]] to convert RSS into h-feed.

When using such alternatives, you should consider RSS or [[Atom]]'s ubiquituous nature. Very few readers support Microformats at this point, compared to the thousands of self-hosted RSS feed readers.

== Shutdowns ==
{{main|feed#Shutdowns}}
This section specifically documents shutdowns or dropping of support for RSS feed files on sites, whether indieweb, corporate, and/or silos.
=== 2015 ===
* {{kartikprabhu}} dropped his RSS (version unknown) feed file [https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/no-rss on 2015-02-10]


More shutdowns are documented in [[feed#Shutdowns|feed shutdowns]].

** "@craigmaloney<br> when you use RSS<br>Your meaning's a mess <br>That's annoying

You really can't tell<br>Plaintext or html <br>That's annoying

Description can be<br>Content or summary <br>That's annoying

And when I click it <br>Browsers show gibberish,<br>That's annoying
