{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RAID</dfn>''' is an acronym for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, a way to protect against disk failure by copying the same data to multiple hard drives.

Note that RAID is not a [[backup]] strategy, all data is  stored locally, and files deleted off one disk are deleted off of all disks.
