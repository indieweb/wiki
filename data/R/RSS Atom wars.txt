The '''<dfn>RSS Atom wars</dfn>''' (or '''syndication wars''') were a toxic [[plumbing]] debate about the merits of using [[Atom]] vs [[RSS]] that dragged in and distracted numerous high level web technologists from 2003-2007 while social [[silos]] (Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, etc.) emerged, rapidly innovated [[UX]], and thus gained popular adoption.

== War timeline ==
Articles during this time period help illustrate the tensions and conflicts:
* 2003-06-28 Aaron Swartz: <cite>[http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000988 Dave Winer said…]</cite> recalls perhaps the origins of the RSS Atom wars.
* 2003-06-29 A polite post by Ben Trott declaring the technical underpinnings for why an alternative to RSS was needed: [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801155433/http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2003/06/why-we-need-ech.html Why We Need Echo] quickly escalates into what would become the RSS/Atom wars:
** The subsequent [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801155433/http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2003/06/why-we-need-ech.html#comments one polite defensive comment]
** And then as of the second comment the patronizing begins, and escalates into full on rudeness, strawmanning, expression of interpersonal dislike, personal attacks, and a darkly prescient prediction: <blockquote>This whole discussion leads to BigCo's stepping in and profiting from the community's weaknesses.</blockquote> They just had no idea that the BigCo's that would step in and profit from this weakness had yet to be founded ([[Facebook]], [[Twitter]]).

* 2003-09-20 Joi Ito: [http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/09/20/if-i-were-micro.html If I were Microsoft...] starts with a vague reference <blockquote>If I were Microsoft I would probably like micro-content and metadata.</blockquote> that is quickly misinterpreted to be about the RSS Atom wars with a reference to both ”RSS or Atom”, followed by arguments over RSS vs Atom vs CDF vs RDF.

* 2004-03-10 Seth Finkelstein: [http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/000558.html RSS/Atom Wars - Peace In Our Time?]: <blockquote><p>How can you route around big media, revolutionize society, create new forms of participatory democracy, solve deeply complicated social problems ... when "we" '''CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON A FORMAT FOR WEB SITE CONTENT SYNDICATION?!'''</p><p>Really. Site syndication is a "little" problem. Nobody is going to literally die over it. Not like access to health care, or poverty, or world wars.</p></blockquote>['''ALL CAPS EMPHASIS''' is from original]
