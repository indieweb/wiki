'''<dfn>#RebootingWebOfTrust</dfn>' are bi-annual Design Workshops for creating whitepapers, specs, and prototyping code for an internet-wide identity layer that puts users in control over their identifiers.

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

    A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
    A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?
