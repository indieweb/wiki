'''<dfn>[http://facebook.github.io/react/ React]</dfn>''' (also called <dfn>ReactJS</dfn>) is an open source client-side JavaScript web [[framework]] created by [[Facebook]]. It's conventionally used to provide an application-like experience on client browsers.

== Summary ==
React is mostly written using the [https://facebook.github.io/jsx/ JSX] superset of javascript, which enables XML-like syntax to be used for creation of components and HTML-tags. That superset is then converted into ordinary javascript by a preprocessor like [https://babeljs.io/ Babel]. That conversion can happen either at runtime or at build time, before eg. a package is published to a package repository like [[npm]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

== Criticism ==
=== abused for content sites ===
Websites that use React often only render on the client-side, which means they are not [[curlable]]. The only HTML in the page on the initial browser load of such sites is typically an empty body and some links to Javascript files. This means that [[microformats]] parsers are unable to see any of the content there. Websites can solve this by adding [[Server-Side Rendering]].

=== harms frontend performance ===
