'''<dfn>[https://react.dev/ React]</dfn>''' (also called <dfn>ReactJS</dfn>) is an open source client-side JavaScript web [[framework]] created by [[Facebook]] and has been used on some indieweb sites. It's conventionally used to provide an application-like experience on client browsers.

== Summary ==
React is mostly written using the [https://facebook.github.io/jsx/ JSX] superset of javascript, which enables XML-like syntax to be used for creation of components and HTML-tags. That superset is then converted into ordinary javascript by a preprocessor like [https://babeljs.io/ Babel]. That conversion can happen either at runtime or at build time, before eg. a package is published to a package repository like [[npm]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
People who use React on their primary personal website:

* {{grantcodes}}
* [[User:Natwelch.com]]

== Criticism ==
=== abused for content sites ===
Websites that use React often only render on the client-side, which means they are not [[curlable]]. The only HTML in the page on the initial browser load of such sites is typically an empty body and some links to Javascript files. This means that [[microformats]] parsers are unable to see any of the content there. Websites can solve this by adding [[Server-Side Rendering]].

=== harms frontend performance ===

We have very talented front-end developers, however, they are not React experts - nor should they need to be. I believe front-end should be built as standards-compliant HTML/CSS with JavaScript used to enrich functionality where necessary and appropriate.</blockquote>

* Criticism: [[GitHub]]'s apparent switch from Web Components to React slowed down their web UI and broke various UI features (back button). thread: https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/111390409414137820
** "We need to talk about GitHub -- and I don't mean co-pilot. No, I mean the basic "does this work on my computer?" and "is it good?" stuff about, you know, a collaborative UI on top of git.Helpfully for GitHub's competitors, recent dogma has demanded that it walk away from the (totally functional, accessible) Web Components infrastructure that led it to be a market success, and replace it with...React? Sure? Fine? As long as the UI is still good? Ok.Whatever.Except that it isn't." [https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff @slightlyoff] November 11, 2023
