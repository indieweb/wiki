{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDFa</dfn>''' is a way of embedding [[RDF]] in HTML that has maybe one or a few publishers on the indieweb, but no known consuming use-cases, perhaps due to being unnecessarily more verbose than [[Microformats]] as demonstrated by the example documented at [http://www.kevinmarks.com/microformatschema.html kevinmarks.com/microformatschema.html].

RDFa adds several attributes to standard HTML: <code>typeof</code> to specify an RDF resource type, <code>vocab</code> to specify the schema containing the type, and (much more plentifully) <code>property</code> to specify the field names described by markup nodes. Microformats use the already existing <code>class</code> attribute for all these purposes, following common [[Semantic HTML]] practices.
