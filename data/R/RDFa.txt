{{stub}}

'''<dfn>RDFa</dfn>''' is a way of embedding [[RDF]] in HTML, but still more verbose than [[Microformats]]. (See example below.)

RDFa adds several attributes to standard HTML: <code>typeof</code> to specify an RDF resource type, <code>vocab</code> to specify the schema containing the type, and (much more plentifully) <code>property</code> to specify the field names described by markup nodes. Microformats use the already existing <code>class</code> for all these purposes (except <code>vocab</code> which it largely elects not to bother with).
