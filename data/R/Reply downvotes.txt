'''<dfn>Reply downvotes</dfn>''' is an experimental [[Twitter]] feature introduced in 2022 that shows up as a down arrow ⇩ on [[replies]] to a tweet, allowing users to one-click indicate that a reply is not adding to the conversation.

(needs screenshot of UI)

== Description ==
When introducing the feature to users, Twitter shows an in-page content pop-up that says:

<blockquote><p>Introducing<br/>Reply downvotes</p><p>Tap to downvote<br/>See a reply that isn’t adding to the conversation? Let us know by downvoting.</p><p>Downvotes are private<br/>Your votes aren’t public and won’t be shared with the Tweet author or others on the timeline.</p><p>Help make Twitter better<br/>Your feedback helps us prioritize higher quality content for you — and everyone on Twitter.</p></blockquote>
