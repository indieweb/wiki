'''<dfn>[https://www.reading.am Reading.am]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] with [[bookmark]] functionality for [[read]] posts about content on the web, primarily geared toward indicating "what you are reading right now." 

<blockquote>Not what you like. Not what you find interesting. Just what you're reading.</blockquote>

The service provides [https://www.reading.am/settings/hooks hooks] as well as an RSS feed for syndicating content from the service to multiple other [[silo|silos]]. The service also has some [https://www.reading.am/settings/extras reasonable data portability] with bookmarklets, browser extensions, posting via email, and [[export]] via HTML, JSON, and CSV. 

Reading.am also supports [[listen|listening]] posts as well for .mp3 files and a form of [[watch]] post for pages (like YouTube) with obvious video content.
