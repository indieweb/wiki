== About ==

IndieWebCamp is a gathering of web [[creators]] building &amp; sharing open web technologies to advance the state of the indie web. We get together for a weekend to discuss how we can empower people to own their identities and data, then spend a day hacking &amp; creating.

The [[2011|first IndieWebCamp]] was held in Portland, Oregon, in 2011. Subsequently, IndieWebCamps have been held in Brighton (England), Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
