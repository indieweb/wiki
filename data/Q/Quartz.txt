'''<dfn>[http://qz.com/ Quartz]</dfn>''' is a news site run by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_(publication) Atlantic Media]. Its mobile app announces stories in the form of a conversation: users "chat" with the app in order to find out more about stories they're interested in.

In November 2016, {{benwerd}} announced that he was going to implement this style of publishing for his personal website.
