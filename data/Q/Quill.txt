* Brainstorming: I wonder if Quill could prompt you when you write more than two paragraphs with a yellow note or something that said something like: It looks like you're writing an article, make sure your first paragraph summarizing the point you're making, and consider adding a title. could be a whole separate feature or script for textarea inputs for posting.
