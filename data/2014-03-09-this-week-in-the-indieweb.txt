=== Evolving IndieWeb ===

* [http://davidjohnmead.com/2014/03/04/updating-to-indieweb/ David John mead is “updating my blog, enabling #posse, #indieauth, #xfn and #microformats.”]

=== Interesting posts ===

* [http://microformats.org/2014/03/05/getting-started-with-microformats2 Getting started with Microformats 2] - Barnaby Walters does a great job of introducing microformats2 in this blog post.
* [http://timkastelle.org/blog/2014/03/you-should-start-a-blog-right-now/ You should start a blog right now] - Tim Kastelle uses lots of resources to explain why you should start blogging right now.
* [http://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/2014/03/06/embeddable-posts-in-idno/ Embeddable posts in idno] - Marcus Povey has written an Idno plugin that enables you to embed idno posts in other blog posts. Much like you can embed other content (tweets, for example) from across the web.
* [http://notenoughneon.com/p/201403062000-query-microformats-like-xpath Query microformats like xpath] - the canonical microformats2 data structure is a dictionary/hash-like object. Emma Kuo’s function makes it slightly easier to find deeply nested elements.
* [http://dangillmor.com/2014/03/08/learning-about-and-deploying-indieweb-tools/ Learning about, and deploying IndieWeb tools] - Dan Gillmor attended IndieWebCamp SF and got his blog set-up to send posts to Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. He's also got twitter replies and retweets to appear as comments against the original blog post.
* [https://medium.com/p/fd121c286cc - Learning to code? First of all, take your cloud back to you by learning to run a web app] - Jose Alcántara argues that we should be promoting the idea of people running their own web apps. Not only do you see benefits sooner than you would if you were trying to learn to code, but it's a hands on way in to learning to code.
