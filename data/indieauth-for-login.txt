'''<dfn>[[IndieAuth]] for login</dfn>''' is a user flow and protocol for web applications to implement user  login via an authorization server. The user chooses an authorization server by linking to it from their home page.

== Authentication Flow ==

# User enters their personal web address in the login form of the web application and clicks "Log in"
# Web application discovers the ''authorization endpoint'' by fetching the user's homepage
# Web application redirects the user's browser to the authorization endpoint
# Authorization endpoint verifies the user, e.g. by logging in
# Authorization endpoint redirects the browser back to the web application, including a code
# Web application verifies the code directly with the authorization endpoint
# User is logged into the web application

== How to Specify an Authorization Endpoint ==
Applications will check the URL entered as the identity for a link tag with a rel value of "authorization_endpoint". You can place this code on your home page to delegate to a specific authorization endpoint of your choosing.

<pre>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="http://indieauth.example.org/"&gt;</pre>
