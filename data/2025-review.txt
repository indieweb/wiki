'''<dfn>2025-review</dfn>''' is a [[year in review]] of indieweb and indiewebcamp accomplishments for all of 2025, as well as indieweb-related news in 2025. 

THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. Please help by adding to the below sections, and adding whole sections from previous review pages. See '''[[:Category:Year in review]]'''.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Blog what you got done on your personal indieweb site in 2025, or any other kind of personal year in review, and add a link here! Roughly in date order (earliest first) by first year in review post made (i.e. if an author made more than one). See [[2024-review#IndieWeb_Examples|last year’s year in review posts]] for examples!

== IndieWebCampers ==
[[2014-review#This_Is_A_Movement|2014's grid of everyone]] who went to an IndieWebCamp looked great - let's make another one for 2025.

Grid of all the people who attended *any* 2025 IndieWebCamp from the Guest_List pages, with their names and domain names underneath their photos - everything linked to their domain. 

'''IN PROGRESS'''. Please add yourself if you participated in an IndieWebCamp in 2025, and feel free to add all others from any IndieWebCamp 2025 Guest List as well!

Please also help with ordering alphabetically by fullname - helps to avoid duplicates!
