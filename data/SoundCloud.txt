'''<dfn>[http://soundcloud.com/ SoundCloud]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] for hosting/sharing/commenting on sounds and music.

It allows embedding of hosted content through the use of iframes.

== IndieWeb uses ==
acegiak.net embeds songs created by others that are on SoundCloud as a way of linking to the content without claiming ownership.

[[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] posts audio to SoundCloud and embeds it on waterpigs.co.uk, e.g. http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4VZBsx/

== Criticism ==
=== Screening and termination by BigContent ===
* 2014-07-01 [http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2014/07/soundcloud-continues-push-boundaries-privacy-policies-enables-universal-screen-monitor-terminate-accounts/ Soundcloud continues to push boundaries of privacy policies; enables Universal to screen, monitor, and terminate accounts] by Valerie Lee

=== Flash still required on desktop ===
Despite having an HTML5 version of the player, the desktop version still requires [[Flash]] in order to play audio. You can apparently get around this with [[User Agent]] spoofing: [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-11-09#t1447106444762]

=== Commentary lock-in ===

When the SoundCloud player is embedded in other posts on other Silos or the web, all comments / likes / etc. are not shown. All the community building effort is locked-in to the SoundCloud site itself. A way to export / relay all commentary for a given track or playlist into Indieweb would be highly desirable. This is important data being produced by individuals that represents valuable information about a given track, and there is currently no way to share this on the open web other than copy and pasting all the text from soundcloud.com, with very poor formatting. A [[bridgy]] feature request was filed: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/587
