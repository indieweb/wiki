{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Navigation</dfn>''' refers to the UI, [[UX]] and markup allowing people to move around a website. On indieweb sites this often consists of:

* top-level [[post]] type links e.g. notes, articles
* previous/next [[pagination]] between consecutive chronologically ordered posts
* the use of [[tags]] to navigate to similar content

== Why ==
So users can easily discover more of your content from your content, preferably contextually relevant, e.g. in time (next/previous), by topic (tags), by type of [[posts]] (e.g. just notes, just articles, just events, just likes).

== How ==
As with any [[UX]] there are a number of approaches. Best to check the IndieWeb Examples provided in each level.

== Levels ==
Levels of navigation support have emerged from implementations in the wild and are part of [[IndieMark]].

In approximate order of frequency and difficulty (more frequent / easier to implement first)

=== Level 1 ===
Level 1: no requirements.

=== Level 2 ===
Level 2: simple linear previous/next navigation across all posts by time order

==== IndieWeb Examples ====
===== Tantek =====
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] on tantek.com to display a previous/next navigation using unicode symbols (←→) on all post permalink pages since 2010-01-01 ([http://tantek.com/2010/032/t7/inventions-to-tweet-from-site explicitly documented 2010-02-01]). Original navigation UI: <br>

=== Level 3 ===
Level 3: time period based archive pages.

=== Level 4 ===
Level 4: [[tag]] based archive pages (paginated by time or amount) of your own content

* [[User:cweiske.de]] uses tag-based and chronological prev/next links [[Image:2014-08-13 cweiske nav.png|thumb]]

=== Future levels ===
Possible futures: (brainstorms, don't know of anyone doing these)
* geo (e.g. city/state/country specific) based archive pages
* mentions of a person (person tags)
