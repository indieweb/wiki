{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/TR/jf2/ jf2]</dfn>''' is a working prototype of a simpler JSON serialization of [[microformats2]] intended to be easier to consume than the standard Microformats JSON representation.

This example of jf2 contains an additional "wm-property" value that indicates the property that contains the primary relation of the webmention. In the example above, this is the "in-reply-to" property, but may also be the "like-of" or "repost-of" property.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} publishes a jf2 feed of his home page and other top-level feeds since 2017-11-25. The jf2 feed is generated by running the HTML of the generated page through [[XRay]] to output the jf2 format.

* https://aaronparecki.com/primary.jf2
* https://aaronparecki.com/replies.jf2
* https://aaronparecki.com/checkins.jf2

=== Grant Richmond ===
{{grantcodes}} is creating a collection of jf2 format post examples at https://grantcodes.github.io/jf2-examples/

=== Kaushal Modi ===
{{kaushalmodi}} publishes jf2 feeds of his home page and other top-level feeds since 2018-04. The jf2 feed is generated using Hugo ([https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-theme-refined/blob/02437d19c3ca585d742a59d4e551bb489214e7da/layouts/_default/list.jf2feed.json Template for generating the jf2 feed]). Similarly jf2 posts are also generated for each post ([https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-theme-refined/blob/02437d19c3ca585d742a59d4e551bb489214e7da/layouts/_default/single.jf2post.json Template for generating the jf2 post]).

* jf2 feed on home page: https://scripter.co/jf2feed.json
* jf2 feed for all posts in 'emacs' category (example): https://scripter.co/categories/emacs/jf2feed.json
* Example of jf2 post: https://scripter.co/fragmentions/jf2post.json

== Implementations ==
=== webmention.io ===
[[webmention.io]] can return a list of mentions of a URL in jf2 format. For example, https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?target=http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/07/digital-memories

=== XRay ===
[[XRay]] parses a number of different formats into a normalized jf2 format. For example:

* [https://xray.p3k.io/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Faaronparecki.com%2F2017%2F10%2F04%2F7%2Fhwcpdx a note]
* [https://xray.p3k.io/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Faaronparecki.com%2F2017%2F10%2F28%2F12%2F a checkin]

=== socialstreams ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} has set up a stream service at http://stream.thatmustbe.us that can convert MF2 to JF2 and back again.  Code can be found on [https://github.com/dissolve/socialstream GitHub]

=== Post Kinds for WordPress ===
{{gwg}} began converting his parsing code within the Post Kinds plugin to returnn jf2 and will likely be reimplementing additional code within same to use a mix of jf2 and mf2 as a way of ensuring better consistency and cross-compatibility. This is a work in progress.
