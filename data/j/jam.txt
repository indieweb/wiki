'''<dfn>jam</dfn>''' is an active type of [[post]] used to share a song that you are recently enjoying. Inspired by the site [[This Is My Jam]].

== Why ==
You should post a jam if you want to share a song that is particularly meaningful to you now.

== How to ==
=== How to markup ===
There is no standard or convention for how to markup a jam post. See below IndieWeb Examples for various approaches, make up your own similarly, and add yourself to the list.

There's a brainstorming proposal to use:

Content of post starts with:
* ‚ô´
* white space
* link/embed of music video/audio

__TOC__ 
=== How to determine ===
There is no standard or convention for how to determine if a post is a jam post. However, based on the brainstorming proposal:

If content starts with "‚ô´" and next thing (after ignoring whitespace) is a link to (or embedding e.g. iframe of) a music video/audio, then it's a jam post.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In order of first use of post type.

{{rrix}} publishes Jams through [https://indiewebcamp.com/User:Notes.whatthefuck.computer#Arcology Arcology] since [http://notes.whatthefuck.computer/jam.html 2016-04-16] by tagging [[Last.fm]] scrape data that he wants to publish with 'JAM', and publishing the site.

- Artist and title included in text.
- Does not use "‚ô´".
- Links to Youtube search for the artist and title since that probably works best worldwide.

{{adactio}} posts jams using [[ACME]] notes [https://adactio.com/notes/10874 since at least 2016-06-25], e.g. 
* https://adactio.com/notes/10874 (also a multijam)

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} posts jams using the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds] plugin for [[WordPress]] beginning on [http://boffosocko.com/2016/11/28/hall-oates-rich-girl/ 11/28/16]. I'm using the ‚ô´ prefix along with the artist and song title followed by an embed that will preferably play the song inline. My typical workflow is to use a [[PESOS]] set up which scrapes my Last.fm account (via RSS) for "loved" songs and posts to WordPress via an [[IFTTT]] applet. Despite the points of failure, this is quick and easy and can also easily be replaced/supplemented with a bookmarket for Post Kinds which uses the following pattern: <code>mypersonalsite.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?kind=jam&kindurl=@url</code> where '@url' is replaced by a link to the song for quicker posting.

{{doubleloop}} posts jams using the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds] plugin for WordPress.   

* Output is an h-entry, with a p-jam-of property which is an h-cite where I put the track name, album title, and artist name, along with a url to the corresponding [https://musicbrainz.org/ musicbrainz] page for the track.  
* In the content I'll put an embed to the video online, e.g. at youtube.

== Silo Examples ==
=== This Is My Jam ===
[[This Is My Jam]] of course, which inspired the post type.

Note that when it syndicates a This Is My Jam "jam" to Twitter (only if you ask / set it up to, opt-in), by default (can opt out) it includes a ‚ô´ musical note emoji just before the permashortlink to the Jam. E.g.
* https://twitter.com/t_silos/status/633910221056933889

== Brainstorming ==
For now, just publish your jam as a [[note]] that starts with a link to the (music) video or audio that you are jamming.

=== Podcast Jams ===
Possible improvement: markup the media file itself in your post as a download to make it part of your [[podcast]] - which could also allow for a distributed version of the "Listen to your friends" feature on This Is My Jam.

=== Jam type indicator ===
Simple/dumb proposal for indicating that a post is a "jam" post:
* start text content of post with ‚ô´ (musical note emoji) - inspired by This Is My Jam syndication behavior.
** it could also be used for a [[listen]] post - though those would likely have the more passive "listened to..." prefix text.

Trying this:
* {{t}} - see example permalinks above. [[selfdogfood]]

=== Markup and content ===
Consider marking up your jams as:
* a simple [[note]] h-entry
Then follow this content pattern, start content with:
* ‚ô´
* white space
* link/embed of music video/audio

Trying this:
* {{t}} - see example permalinks above. [[selfdogfood]]

== FAQ ==
=== Why ‚ô´ ===
Q: Why is the "‚ô´" symbol used instead of: üéµüé∂‚ô©‚ô¨‚ô™‚ô´ ùÑûùÑ¢ùÑ° ?

A: Because [[This Is My Jam]] already set a design precedent with their cross-postings to Twitter which use "‚ô´"[https://twitter.com/t_silos/status/646859054862761984]
