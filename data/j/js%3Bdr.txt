Commentary threads:
* [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9247871 Hacker News] <blockquote>I surf the web with NoScript (a FireFox extension to block java script on a per-domain basis, the sake of security). That also enforces "js; dr". Some pages show absolutely no content unless you allow JS from their domain, and perhaps others. I often don't bother; just back button out of there and go somewhere else.</blockquote>
* [https://www.reddit.com/comments/2ys5nk Reddit] <blockquote>I am seeing more and more single-page apps that are nothing more than documents, blogs or articles for which relying on JavaScript is not appropriate. Often this breaks down one way or another (back button, stuck "loading" screen, bad formatting).</blockquote>

** ... lots of individual tweets, threads, follow-ups

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} lost the 1999 version of his website, and archive.org only has the front page because many pages were hidden behind Javascript popup window links.

== Dead To History Examples ==
Examples of js;dr sites that failed to be archived in the [[Internet Archive]], subsequently [[site-deaths|died]], and thus all their content is dead to history.

=== Readability ===
[[Readability]] was js;dr:

<blockquote>[https://twitter.com/m_ott/status/820714299895218176 In case you ever wondered how data loss thanks to ‚ÄúJavaScript required‚Äù looks like‚Ä¶ <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2PDTIoXgAIqpK7.jpg" style="max-width:100%" alt="screenshot of archive.org snapshot of Readability site missing content"/>]</blockquote>
(Screenshot showing Readability with "Loading Readlists..." but no actual content due to js;dr).


== Web Content Examples ==
Examples of primarily content-based sites that are js;dr, in other words, have no real excuse other than poor engineering (or paying for poor engineering)

=== Huffington Post ===
Huffington Post articles are js;dr as noted https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/651165250666938369

[https://twitter.com/mmasnick/status/651164931396468736 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQlnByNVAAUNW7n.png]

=== Pacific Standard ===
If you load the [http://www.psmag.com/ Pacific Standard] without JS, you get a blank page.

=== The Mill ===
http://www.themillsf.com/ is a San Francisco based cafe and bakery that serves pizza on Monday nights.

* Solution: create your own indie [[venue]], and in the link to their own home page, add caveats like "WARNING: Unreadable on some browsers due to Javascript. See js;dr for more."

=== Open Switch ===
* http://www.openswitch.net/

What should be a very simple content-based website is rendered by Javascript instead. The initial view shows a loading icon which then renders the page after a few seconds.

=== Security Trap ===
Articles on securitytrap.com, e.g.:
* http://www.securitytrap.com/mail/bugtraq/2004/Oct/0287.html (found via https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=30609 related to [[curl]] function in [[PHP]])
ironically are empty without JS enabled: <blockquote>This site requires JavaScript and Cookies to be enabled. Please change your browser settings or upgrade your browser.</blockquote>

As predicted in the js;dr post[http://tantek.com/2015/069/t1/js-dr-requires-javascript-dead] - that securitytrap.com article is dead to history - the archive.org copy is empty of any content:
* http://web.archive.org/web/20080401235506/http://www.securitytrap.com/mail/bugtraq/2004/Oct/0287.html

=== Webwewant Mozilla ===
2014-05-04 @seanparsons: ‚Äú[https://twitter.com/seanparsons/status/462993907585134592 One that doesn't require Javascript]‚Äù

2016-06-10 @anseljh: ‚Äú[https://twitter.com/anseljh/status/741391388122710016 The web I want doesn't need JavaScript to render content, @Mozilla.]‚Äù

[https://twitter.com/anseljh/status/741391388122710016 <img style="width:100%" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CknziVhWYAAVXQP.jpg" alt="Screenshot of https://webwewant.mozilla.org/en/" />]

Shows webwewant.mozilla.org loaded without Javascript, and a mostly blank screen.

=== Webmaker ===
https://webmaker.org displays no content without Javascript, as the entire content of the page is loaded from Javascript.

[[File:webmaker-jsdr.png|600px]]

=== Apple Podcasts Connect Help ===
Apple's [https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390 Podcasts Connect Help documentation] is js;dr for no good reason. Just content with a tree navigation sidebar, totally doable in HTML+CSS.

However at least they tell you in dozens of languages that:<blockquote>To see this page, you must enable JavaScript.</blockquote>

[[File:2017-11-03-itunes-podcast-docs-jsdr.png]]

Except that one third from the bottom, looks like someone was slacking: <blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing JavaScript.</blockquote>

=== Adobe Creative Cloud Pricing ===
[[File:2017-12-31-adobe-creative-cloud-pricing.png]]

=== Other ===
* ... add other js;dr content-centric examples here, along with suggested workarounds

If it's hosting of someone else's content, add it to the '''Silo Examples''' section below.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Blogspot ===
Google's [[Blogspot]] weblog hosting [[silo]]'s new (2014 and later?) templates tend to be js;dr, completely unnecessary and undesirable for a content-centric service. E.g. as tweeted: https://twitter.com/parkr/status/651142997564755968

[https://twitter.com/parkr/status/651142997564755968 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQlTGygVEAAImSG.png]

=== Dropbox file URLs ===
[[Dropbox]] file URLs require loading scripts across multiple domains just to view a simple JPEG:

[[File:2017-03-24-dropbox-js-dr-jpg.png]]

=== Google Photos ===
[[Google Photos]] photo post permalinks are [[js;dr]] when they should at a minimum actually display the photo:

[[File:2017-06-16-google-photos-js-dr.png]]

== Web App Examples ==
=== Google Maps ===
If you load [[Google Maps]] without JS, you get a cheeky error message:

[[File:googlemapsjsdr.png|700px]]

== The New Flash ==
Other (perhaps "artistic") examples which in the 1990s/2000s would have been built and deployed with Flash/SWF, and yet now depend on JS and perhaps other technologies designed to replace many old Flash use-cases.
=== networkeffect io ===
The site networkeffect.io when browsed without JS on, says: <blockquote>To view this website, please enable JavaScript in your browser.</blockquote>
If you do enable JS, and your browser supports whatever JS their site has, you might see a screen like:

[https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/651482137464541184 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQqHjTOUEAAkt3q.png]

Thus elevating WebGL to one kind of "New Flash". (As discovered from https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/651482137464541184 )

At a minimum the site should have a static text description, with perhaps a static image screenshot of what the WebGL would render by default.

== Unsorted Examples ==
Rando js;dr sites that no one has bothered to further define or document whatever they are or do.
