'''<dfn>js;dr</dfn>''' is [[JavaScript]] required; Didn’t Read. 
<blockquote><p>Pages that are empty without JS: dead to history (archive-org), unreliable for search results (despite any search engine claims of JS support, check it yourself), and thus ignorable. No need to waste time reading or responding.</p><p>Also known as, if it’s not curlable, it’s not on the web.</p></blockquote>
* From: https://tantek.com/2015/069/t1/js-dr-requires-javascript-dead

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} lost the 1999 version of his website, and archive.org only has the front page because many pages were hidden behind Javascript popup window links.
* [[Smallest Federated Wiki]] ([[project|software]]). Not sure how inherent its js;dr is; maybe possible to write a non-js;dr theme/client?

__TOC__
== Dead To History Examples ==
Examples of js;dr sites that failed to be archived in the [[Internet Archive]], subsequently [[site-deaths|died]], and thus all their content is dead to history.
=== Readability ===
[[Readability]] was js;dr:

<blockquote>[https://twitter.com/m_ott/status/820714299895218176 In case you ever wondered how data loss thanks to “JavaScript required” looks like… <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2PDTIoXgAIqpK7.jpg" style="max-width:50%" alt="screenshot of archive.org snapshot of Readability site missing content"/>]</blockquote>
(Screenshot showing Readability with "Loading Readlists..." but no actual content due to js;dr).

== Web Content Examples ==
Examples of primarily content-based sites that are js;dr, in other words, have no real excuse other than poor engineering (or paying for poor engineering)

=== Huffington Post ===
Huffington Post articles are js;dr as noted https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/651165250666938369

[https://twitter.com/mmasnick/status/651164931396468736 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQlnByNVAAUNW7n.png]

=== The Mill ===
https://www.themillsf.com/ is a San Francisco based cafe and bakery that serves pizza on Monday nights.

* Solution: create your own indie [[venue]], and in the link to their own home page, add caveats like "WARNING: Unreadable on some browsers due to Javascript. See js;dr for more."

=== Open Switch ===
* https://www.openswitch.net/

What should be a very simple content-based website is rendered by Javascript instead. The initial view shows a loading icon which then renders the page after a few seconds.

=== Security Trap ===
Articles on securitytrap.com, e.g.:
* http://www.securitytrap.com/mail/bugtraq/2004/Oct/0287.html (found via https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=30609 related to [[curl]] function in [[PHP]])
ironically are empty without JS enabled: <blockquote>This site requires JavaScript and Cookies to be enabled. Please change your browser settings or upgrade your browser.</blockquote>

As predicted in the js;dr post[http://tantek.com/2015/069/t1/js-dr-requires-javascript-dead] - that securitytrap.com article is '''dead to history''' - the archive.org copy is empty of any content:
* http://web.archive.org/web/20080401235506/http://www.securitytrap.com/mail/bugtraq/2004/Oct/0287.html

=== Webwewant Mozilla ===
2014-05-04 @seanparsons: “[https://twitter.com/seanparsons/status/462993907585134592 One that doesn't require Javascript]”

2016-06-10 @anseljh: “[https://twitter.com/anseljh/status/741391388122710016 The web I want doesn't need JavaScript to render content, @Mozilla.]”

[https://twitter.com/anseljh/status/741391388122710016 <img style="width:100%" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CknziVhWYAAVXQP.jpg" alt="Screenshot of https://webwewant.mozilla.org/en/" />]

Shows webwewant.mozilla.org loaded without Javascript, and a mostly blank screen.


2019-06-21 Webwewant.mozilla.org now (since when) redirects to mozilla.org

=== Webmaker ===
https://webmaker.org displays no content without Javascript, as the entire content of the page is loaded from Javascript.

[[File:webmaker-jsdr.png|600px]]

=== Apple Podcasts Connect Help ===
Apple's [https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390 Podcasts Connect Help documentation] is js;dr for no good reason. Just content with a tree navigation sidebar, totally doable in HTML+CSS.

However at least they tell you in dozens of languages that:<blockquote>To see this page, you must enable JavaScript.</blockquote>

[[File:2017-11-03-itunes-podcast-docs-jsdr.png]]

Except that one third from the bottom, looks like someone was slacking: <blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing JavaScript.</blockquote>

=== Adobe Creative Cloud Pricing ===
[[File:2017-12-31-adobe-creative-cloud-pricing.png]]

=== Other ===
* ... add other js;dr content-centric examples here, along with suggested workarounds

If it's hosting of someone else's content, add it to the '''Silo Examples''' section below.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Blogspot ===
Google's [[Blogspot]] weblog hosting [[silo]]'s new (2014 and later?) templates tend to be js;dr, completely unnecessary and undesirable for a content-centric service. E.g. as tweeted: https://twitter.com/parkr/status/651142997564755968

[https://twitter.com/parkr/status/651142997564755968 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQlTGygVEAAImSG.png]

=== Dropbox file URLs ===
[[Dropbox]] file URLs require loading scripts across multiple domains just to view a simple JPEG:

[[File:2017-03-24-dropbox-js-dr-jpg.png]]

=== Google Photos ===
[[Google Photos]] photo post permalinks are [[js;dr]] when they should at a minimum actually display the photo:

[[File:2017-06-16-google-photos-js-dr.png]]

=== WT Social ===
WT.social appears to be 100% js;dr, e.g. https://wt.social/wt/indieweb:

[[File:2019-11-20-wt-social-jsdr.png]]
Only default visible text: <blockquote>Loading... Please enable Javascript</blockquote>

News (or commentary upon) and social network profiles should be serving HTML by default, not depending on JS.

== Web App Examples ==
=== Google Maps ===
If you load [[Google Maps]] without JS, you get a cheeky error message:

[[File:googlemapsjsdr.png|700px]]

== The New Flash ==
Other (perhaps "artistic") examples which in the 1990s/2000s would have been built and deployed with Flash/SWF, and yet now depend on JS and perhaps other technologies designed to replace many old Flash use-cases.
=== networkeffect io ===
The site networkeffect.io when browsed without JS on, says: <blockquote>To view this website, please enable JavaScript in your browser.</blockquote>
If you do enable JS, and your browser supports whatever JS their site has, you might see a screen like:

[https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/651482137464541184 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQqHjTOUEAAkt3q.png]

Thus elevating WebGL to one kind of "New Flash". (As discovered from https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/651482137464541184 )

At a minimum the site should have a static text description, with perhaps a static image screenshot of what the WebGL would render by default.

== Unsorted Examples ==
Rando js;dr sites that no one has bothered to further define or document whatever they are or do.
* [http://wiki.c2.com/ WikiWikiWeb] (the first wiki) since [http://forage.ward.fed.wiki.org/view/migrating-wiki 2015] (link also js;dr; summary at bottom of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb#History). There's some discussion about it (including workaround) in a [https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/18 Github issue].

== In Print ==
This book will last longer than your javascript:

I often don't bother; just back button out of there and go somewhere else.</blockquote>

* [[Pleroma]] appears to be js;dr, bad enough to result in blank Internet Archive pages e.g. http://web.archive.org/web/20190210051200/https://pleroma.site/notice/2967381 (even with JS) is blank compared to the original https://pleroma.site/notice/2967381

* Example: 2019-07-12 https://www.profgalloway.com/facebook-tyranny <blockquote>If you're seeing this message, that means JavaScript has been disabled on your browser, please enable JS to make this app work.</blockquote> Presumably a blog post, unreadable / text unavailable due to the site / “app”'s unnecessary dependence on JS.
* Example: https://live.ineos159challenge.com/ <blockquote>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</blockquote>
* Example: https://www.mixily.com/ <blockquote>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</blockquote> Y THO? Not even static documentation about what it is? And why bother?
* Example: https://neal.fun/size-of-space/ <blockquote>You need to enable JavaScript to see the goods</blockquote> while it could have easily had at least the nice static image background, and descriptive text, and sequence of images with names and image scales (dimensions). Beautiful site, could have a very reasonable non-JS experience. Maybe even fully non-JS using scrolling and CSS, transitions & transforms.
