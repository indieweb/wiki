'''<dfn>cloud</dfn>''' within the context of the indieweb refers to "cloud computing", computing services which provide:
* on-demand self-service
* broad network access
* resource pooling
* rapid elasticity
* measured service
according to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Characteristics|The National Institute of Standards and Technology's definition of cloud computing] (expansion on each the above points provided at link)

== Cloud things ==
You might also be looking for:
* [[CloudFlare]]
* [[Cloudfront]]
* [[iCloud]]

== Building block vs apps ==
Sometimes these on-demand/self-service/elastic/measured cloud services are used for computing building blocks such as storage, computation, and server bandwidth.
* Examples: Amazon S3, EC2. Akamai.

The term "cloud" is also used to refer to such services which are applications themselves such as [[email]], [[blogging]], etc. which are almost always [[silos]] as well:
* Examples: [[gmail]] (barely cloud-like in that its storage capacity is slowly growing), [[Blogger]], [[Wordpress.com]]

== Relation to IndieWeb ==
There are a number of indieweb community members who are putting specific effort into moving away from cloud [[silos]] and rebuilding their applications on top of cloud (or even just [[web hosting]]) building blocks, from providers they can swap in and out and switching between at their desire.

=== just means internet or server ===
There many intentional and unintentional misuses of the word "cloud" in reference to "cloud computing" which do not meet the definition or criteria above in one or more ways. As such the following phrases can typically be substituted:

;"in the cloud"
:= on the internet
;"personal cloud"
:= personal (virtual) server

=== marketing and branding ===
As "cloud" is a more recent (and shorter/catchier) term than "server" or "internet" or "virtual host", there are also now commercial services which use "cloud" in the name of their service which do not actually provide cloud computing services.
