{{stub}}

'''<dfn>activities</dfn>''' in the [[ActivityStreams]] sense represent actions associated with [[posts]], are the content unit of ActivityStreams, and a needlessly more complex (requiring more objects and relations) way to represent [[posts]]. In practice activities are an unnecessary abstraction that can be more simply replaced by [[posts]], [[webmentions]], and HTTP based [[CRUD]].
