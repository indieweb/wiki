'''<dfn>Lemmy</dfn>''' is open source bookmarking and commenting software that supports [[ActivityPub]] so multiple instances can in essence provide a distributed version of [[Reddit]], and it supports at least sending [[Webmention]]s as well.

== IndieWeb Friendly ==
* [[Webmention]] support, as evidenced by this Lemmy post: https://defed.lemmy.tf/post/154469 sending a Webmention to the post: [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/10/20/indieweb-talk/ The IndieWeb Movement: Owning Your Data and Being the Change You Want to See in the Web], and showing up as a mention in that postâ€™s Interactions section.
** There is also an issue for improving the Webmention support: https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1982

== Mobile Apps ==
There are several open-source native [[mobile]] apps available for Lemmy:

* Mlem for iOS. (Beta.) [https://github.com/mormaer/Mlem Github], [https://testflight.apple.com/join/xQfmkJhc Apple TestFlight].
* Jerboa for Android. [https://github.com/dessalines/jerboa GitHub], [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jerboa Google Play]. See GitHub link for additional app stores.
