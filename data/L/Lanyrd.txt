== Downtime ==
=== Downtime 2018-01 ===
Numerous people have reported Lanyrd to be down during January 2018. It has been down for over a week. It has now been added to [[site-deaths]].

* The site came back in read-only mode on the morning of 2018-1-27, with no indication of how long it would remain online. There is no explicit available data export mechanism though users can save pages as HTML or back them up to the Internet Archive or via other manual means.

=== Downtime 2016-09 ===
Lanyrd appears to have been down for at least part of the weekend of 2016-09-04 per https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/status/772432792529539072 <blockquote>Lanyrd disappearing all weekend has prompted me to work on adding speaking stuff to my own site. Amazing how much data I didn’t ‘own’.</blockquote>
