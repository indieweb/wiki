'''<dfn>Lwa</dfn>''' is a in-progress social [[reader]] by {{jackyalcine}} that aims to provide a people-centric approach to the social Web. It's comprised of a [[PWA]] for the Web browser, a proxy server for handling requests from [[Micropub]] and [[Microsub]] as well (for handling [[Web sign-in]], [[post type discovery]] and [[reply|a reply proxying bridge]]). 

== Experiments ==
=== Composable Editor ===
The composable [[Micropub]] editor provided in Lwa is meant to be the ''advanced'' mode of the editing experience; for those who want to craft a particular item down to the property. This is a set of [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components Web Components] optimized for use within Lwa.

Source code (pending) is at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lwa-composer

== Goals ==

* Checking if a [[reaction]] was made to a particular post
* Inline [[reaction]] views from source and syndicated sources (configurable, requiring auth)
* [[Web sign-in]]
