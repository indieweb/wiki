'''<dfn>Lwa</dfn>''' is a in-progress social [[reader]] by {{jackyalcine}} at https://lwa.black.af that aims to provide an adaptive approach to rendering social feeds.

== Features ==

=== Composer ===
The composer is the part of the experience that allows people to create [[posts]] while examining their timelines. It'll be explicit designed for composing [[notes]], [[photos]], [[videos]] and [[bookmarks]]. Avoiding super-long form text (like [[articles]]) as that's not in the scope of the project.

==== Auto Suggestion ====
In order to aid users with composing, [[autosuggest]] support is built into the experience. A list of [[h-card]] information will be shown as the user types from

* their [[nickname-cache|nickname cache]],
* a list of [[h-card]]s from the current post being replied to (if any)
* a list of [[h-card]]s from the current channel being viewed

No sort of weighting will be used as the order above will rely on the the [[nickname-cache]] to inform what names should be shown the closest to the top.

=== Post Rendering ===
In combination with using the information from Microsub servers, Lwa will extend posts from their source MF2 to properly display
* [[like]]
* [[reply]]
* [[note]]
* [[photo]]
* [[video]]
* [[repost]]
* [[rsvp]]
* [[event]]

=== Subscription Support ===
Provides an endpoint that can be used for to [[follow]] people via [[rel-subscribe]].

=== [[WebSub]] support ===

=== Silo Rendering ===
Provides logic to render content from
* [[Twitter]]
* [[ActivityPub]]-centric sites like [[Pleroma]], [[Mastodon]] and [[PixelFed]]
* [[GitHub]]
