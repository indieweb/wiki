=== Composer ===
The composer is the part of the experience that allows people to create [[posts]] while examining their timelines.

* [[like]]
* [[reply]]
* [[note]]
* [[photo]]
* [[video]]
* [[repost]]
* [[rsvp]]
* [[event]]

=== Subscription Support ===
Provides an endpoint that can be used for to [[follow]] people via [[rel-subscribe]].

=== [[WebSub]] support ===

=== Native Silo Rendering ===
Provides logic to natively render content from
* [[Twitter]]
* [[ActivityPub]]-centric sites like [[Pleroma]], [[Mastodon]] and [[PixelFed]]
