Loqi will respond to certain commands and queries entered in the chat.

Questions can optionally include a question mark at the end.

=== Wiki ===
; what is xyz, what are xyzs, what is an xyz, what was xyz
: Looks up "xyz" on the wiki and responds with the first sentence of the page that includes a [[dfn|dfn element]].
; what is xyz,
; xyz is A Long and Boring Definition
:  Adds [[dfn|dfn element]]
; xyz is _____
: After a "what is xyz" prompt, saying "xyz is ___" will create a new stub wiki page with the definition.
; xyz is <nowiki>http(s)://____, _____</nowiki>
: If the definition starts with an URL, followed by a comma, [[Kaja]] will afterwards edit the page to link the <code><nowiki><dfn></nowiki></code> to the URL

; when is X
: Looks up "X" on the wiki, and if it's an event, responds with the date and location of the event

: Convert between unix timestamps and readable dates. Try giving him other date formats too.

: <Loqi> Okay, I blocked "dahstar" from all IndieWeb Twitter searches

== Ideas ==
Brainstorms and feature requests for Loqi!

; who uses xyz
: This question could respond with a link to [[xyz#IndieWeb_Examples]].
: Alternative syntax: "anyone here use xyz", "who supports xyz"

; why xyz
: This question could respond with a link to [[xyz#Why]].
: Alternative syntax: "why should I use xyz", "why should I support xyz"

; report updates from an XML feed
: [[User:tommorris.org]] [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-15/line/1408095816551 Suggested on IRC] that updates to relevant Wikipedia articles might be useful
: enwp.org/IndieWebCamp, enwp.org/IndieWeb, enwp.org/webmention, enwp.org/microformats

; limit the number of RT notifications for a given post.
: Posts mentioning indieweb that are retweeted many times can be very distracting. 
: http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-09-19#t1411110119165

;!seen ircnickname
:Responds with last time Loqi saw ircnickname do something in the channel (say something, enter/leave etc.)

; where is xyz?
: Finds the person's website on [[irc-people]] and looks for the latest post in their stream that contains location, and says "xyz last posted from {location} at {date / date and time} {url}"

;optional ! if line is directed at Loqi
: "Loqi: tell tantek..." would work the same as "!tell tantek"

; Allow linking <nowiki><dfn></nowiki> in definitions
: e.g. by saying "_____ is https://example.com, ....."

; Report page creations differently
: A link to the main page is often more useful than the diff shown currently

; Warn (or even reject / require confirmation) if you try to !tell someone who has never joined the channel
: "I have not seen that nickname in this channel, are you sure you want to try leaving a message for them?"
: (same !tell as before, i.e. copy paste, or "yes Loqi", or "yes")
: "Ok, I'll tell them that when, or if they show up here."

; Multiple nicknames for karma
: {{strugee}} uses a different nickname on Freenode than he does on W3C IRC, and would feel far cooler if he could "link" these nicknames so their karma was the same.

; Only deliver a message when user is seen in the past 2 months
: When a non-regular visitor of the IRC channel says something, they often get spammed with a lot of "can you attend X next week" from months ago.
: When someone attempts to send a message: check if the user was online if the past 2 (or 1 or 3?) months, and if not, warn the user and don't take the message, but urge them to e-mail / look at their domain to know how to contact.

; PM with reminder of the messages in a channel
: When a person never says something in a specific channel, but there is a message lurking, the person will not receive the message despite being active in other channels.
: Send a PM to a person who says something in an IndieWeb channel, when there is a message in another channel. Only "there is a message for you in #indieweb-x", not the actual message.

; Notifications via Webmention
: Send a notification (probably a homepage-webmention?) when someone mentions you in chat and/or sends a !tell

More to link-up and come up with equivalent responses that make sense:
* Hey Loqi, show me photos of my UI sketches
* Hey Loqi, tell aaronpk I want to code Loqi features
* Hey Loqi, how does a [https://duckduckgo.com/html/?type=list&q=PHP+array PHP array] compare to a [https://duckduckgo.com/html/?type=list&q=JS+array JS array]?
** [http://php.net/manual/en/function.array.php PHP array] vs [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array JS array]
* Hey Loqi, play this week in indieweb podcast
* Hey Loqi, create a new itches section, for next HWC
* Hey Loqi, play https://youtu.be/ufBLI6bB9sg for aaronpk

== Bugs ==
* fragmention: Loqi strips out the fragmention link from tweets. e.g.: http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-11-30#t1448927404974
* bug: loqi's "When is" is case-sensitive. Only returns the link with lowercase "when is..."
* bug: don't ignore lone stopwords, e.g. "what is about?"
* "what is..." for h-event pages does not return the name or summary.
* bug: !cancel should work with (#6198) and #6198 variants (e.g. !cancel #6198) since Loqi says "(#6198)" literally when he confirms the timer was created: https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-10-24/1508862956980000
