:  Adds [[dfn|dfn element]]
; xyz is _____
: After a "what is xyz" prompt, saying "xyz is ___" will create a new stub wiki page with the definition.
: To create a redirect, after asking for a page, say "xyz is /abd". Loqi creates "abc" as a redirect.
; xyz is <nowiki>http(s)://____, _____</nowiki>
: If the definition starts with an URL, followed by a comma, [[Kaja]] will afterwards edit the page to link the <code><nowiki><dfn></nowiki></code> to the URL

=== Anti-Spam ===
We've seen a wave of IRC spam on Freenode over the last few months, so Loqi now has some anti-spam techniques.

* if you say more uppercase than lowercase characters other than the URL, and if you joined in the last 5 minutes, then you get kicked
* if you say the same URL 5 times within a minute, you get kicked

If you're registered on [[chat-names]] then these rules do not run. Additionally, if you're registered on [[chat-names]], then you can use the <code>!kick</code> command:

* You can say <code>!kick foobar</code> to kick that person from the room, but only if they joined less than 5 minutes ago

== Ideas ==
Please add brainstorms and feature requests to Loqi's [https://github.com/aaronpk/Loqi/issues issue tracker on GitHub].
