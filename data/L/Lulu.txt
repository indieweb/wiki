'''<dfn>[https://lulu.com Lulu]</dfn>''' is a print-on-demand [[book]] service that could be used to print a physical copy of their website, as a back up or for [[longevity]].

Anecdotally mentioned in chat, at least one person is planning on using this service to print (a portion of) their website as a physical book.

== Advantages ==

* Provides an easy-to-use interface to configure printing options
* Useful for people who do not have printers at home or who do not have a printer that meets their book printing specifications (which is likely if you want a hardback book, for example)
* You can order one copy of a book rather than having to buy in bulk

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{jamesgoca}} has created a printed version of his blog which was printed using Lulu
* {{addyourself}}
