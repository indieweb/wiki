'''<dfn>[https://lulu.com Lulu]</dfn>''' is a print-on-demand [[book]] service that could be used to print a physical copy of their website, as a back up or for [[longevity]].

Anecdotally mentioned in chat, at least one person is planning on using this service to print (a portion of) their website as a physical book.
