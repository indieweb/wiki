[[Category:silo]]

'''<dfn>[http://linkedin.com/ LinkedIn]</dfn>''' is a special-purpose [[silo]] for hosting your professional resume, history, and contacts.

== Why ==
You may want to post (or POSSE) your resume to LinkedIn to find a job.

== How to export your data ==

# Right hand menu / Privacy & Settings - Manage
# Getting an archive of your data - Change
# Fast file (''from memory... this part is unavailable now that I've done it'')

Then they send you email when it's ready.

The result is a "Rich Media" directory and a bunch of CSV files:

== Issues ==
__TOC__
Issues are problems due to perhaps ignorance (rather than malice) that we optimistically hope could/would be fixed.

=== Lack of rel-me ===
LinkedIn has a way to add your "Blog" URL to your LinkedIn profile, however, it has multiple problems:
* your LinkedIn profile URL does not actually have curlable hyperlink markup to your blog (JSON only)
* hyperlink itself uses a linkedin redirect to your blog
* hyperlink in the DOM lacks a rel=me

So LinkedIn will not work as an [[IndieAuth]] provider.

== Criticism ==
Criticism applies to bad behaviors that have some amount of malintent / maldesign.

=== Removing Key Features ===

* 2018-01: "We’re removing manually entered contacts data."
* 2016-12: Relationship Section of Profile - No Longer Available

They demoted search-by-location to the point where it was nearly impossible to use, but it seems to be better now. [[User:Madmode.com|Madmode.com]] ([[User talk:Madmode.com|talk]]) 19:38, 5 January 2018 (PST)

=== Creepy emails ===
In order to retain users, LinkedIn now send out emails to tell you that people are looking at your profile, which is kind of creepy. The subject lines are of the form: "(name), people are looking at your LinkedIn profile".

It doesn't quite reach dark pattern levels of evil, but it is playing on your natural anxiety around being watched (especially in an era of PRISM and Edward Snowden etc.)

=== Treats Import as Spam Contacts ===
LinkedIn spams everyone you "import": 
* 2013-03-06 https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/309417266842308608 <blockquote>With three clicks, I (accidentally) asked 1138 people to connect on LinkedIn using their import feature. Goddammit, I hate you LinkedIn.</blockquote>
* 2013-03-06 Matt Haughey: [http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2013/03/linkedin-is-a-virus.html LinkedIn is a Virus] - longer blog post with follow-up analysis
* 2016-03 Evert Pot: [https://evertpot.com/10-years-of-linkedin/ 10 years on LinkedIn] - Blog post stating that it's too valuable to close the account, but full of "creepy practises"

=== Public Profiles Require Login to View ===
As of 2017-??, even with all the public profile settings enabled, profiles require logging in to view. Viewing a public profile URL without being logged in presents a login screen.

=== Public Feed Updates Require Login to View ===
Similarly, likely around the same timeframe, public posts require logging in to view.

E.g.: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:linkedInArticle:6352488579234570240/

and errantly says: "Oops… / This post is not available"

Confirmed that it requires login: https://twitter.com/ndw/status/948883716239224833

Workaround:
* use their "pulse" links instead:
** e.g. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-newwwyear-simon-st-laurent/ (via https://twitter.com/simonstl/status/949315797368918017)

== POSSE to LinkedIn ==
LinkedIn features an API that supports "sharing content on LinkedIn", which can be used for POSSEing. Based on a session at IndieWebCamp Brighton 2016 it had apparently not been attempted; subsequently {{sgreger}} presented a proof-of-concept at the IndieWebCamp.

Useful resources:
* https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/share-on-linkedin
* https://github.com/valpatsk/LinkedIn-OAuth2.0-PHP

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/shares/network-update-social-actions#retrieve-comments-on-shares Backfeeding comments and likes is also possible via the API.]

=== POSSE Examples ===
* sgreger started POSSEing to LinkedIn on 2016-09-25
** original: ???
** POSSE copy: https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/updates?topic=6185750612253175808
