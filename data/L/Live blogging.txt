'''<dfn>Live blogging</dfn>''' is when you write short social posts or status updates in response to an ongoing event as it happens, and something various IndieWeb community members have done on their blogs.

== Why ==

Live blogging lets you capture your thoughts about an event in the time it is happening. You can refer back to the notes you have taken later to see how you felt about a particular event.

You may also choose to live blog to factilitate interactions with other people who care about the event you are following. For instance, live blogging an event such as the Academy Awards might encourage other people you know who are watching the show to share their thoughts with you too.

== How ==

You can live blog by writing short posts on any social platform while an event is still happening. You may choose to write posts on your own site and syndicate them elsewhere using [[POSSE]] so you will own the main copies of each live post you write.

You might choose to use a particular hashtag to group your notes. If you are live blogging on your personal site, you might want to use a dedicated tag or page so all of your notes on a topic appear in a single place.

There are many topics you can discuss through live blogging. Here are a few:

* a conference
* a major news story that has come out
* a sports event with personal significance
* a television show you are watching
* or anything else that you're attending or watching and find interesting

Your live blog may include reactions, quotations, or anything else that comes to mind while an event is happening.
