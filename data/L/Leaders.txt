'''<dfn>Leaders Summits</dfn>''' are half-day events for everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] or was active organizing [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups in the past two years. (Due to the spread-out nature of our community, many attend remotely).

== next ==
The participants in the [[2017/Leaders|2017 Leaders summit]] (before [[2017|IWS]]) decided that more frequent (than yearly) Leaders Summits could be beneficial.

The next IndieWeb Summit will be mid-[[2018]], and it's very likely we'll have a Leaders Summit the morning before the Summit.

If you're [[planning]] an IndieWebCamp between now and the next summit, and want to organize a Leaders Summit beforehand, drop a heads-up here linking to your IndieWebCamp's planning page with details about a proposed Leaders Summit.

=== Issues ===
collect issues here until a specific agenda page for the event is created
* [[Code of Conduct]] One of the pieces missing from it is an ombudsmanish contact/enforcement mechanism or a means of helping to resolve issues. Usually at Camps we mention up front who to contact or converse with privately if someone has an issue? How would that/could that be done in our online space? Or at least doing so in private if someone had difficulty in speaking up. I suspect Gen2+ folks may have even bigger issues for contacting leadership for resolution depending on their level of technical ability. Who would they contact and how? Privately at least?
** [[code-of-conduct-feedback#Contact_Information|Long standing feedback]], donâ€™t let this turn 2 years old!
** [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2017-07-14#t1500069166660000 Chris reminding us in chat.]
** For IWC, specify how CoC should be brought up. Make sure organisers remember to point out contacts. Maybe update [[IndieWebCamps#How_to_organize|IWC: How to organize]] with this?
* What services are essential for running the IndieWeb community resources, and who has access to them?
** Content
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[wiki]] [https://github.com/indieweb/wiki available on GitHub].
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[discuss|chat]] logs [https://github.com/indieweb/indieweb-chat-archive available on GitHub].
** Domain name(s)
*** Who has access to <code><nowiki>indieweb.org</nowiki></code>, can configure the DNS, etc?
*** How can access to these be split amongst several people?
** Communication
*** Who can manage the [[Slack]] server / channels?
*** Who can manage the [[IRC]] channels?
**** It looks like we have several <code>+o</code> people. Are they all listed as Founders or equal on ChanServ?
**** all ops are in US timezones and thus not available on EU mornings (discussed 2017-12-17 due to small spam-wave on Freenode)
**** Is there anything to gain from [https://freenode.net/groupreg registering with Freenode]? (or has this been done already?)
*** Is there any managing we have to do for the [[Matrix]] bridge?
*** How quickly could a new Slack bridge be created if [[Loqi]] goes down? The bridge code is [https://github.com/aaronpk/Slack-IRC-Gateway available on GitHub].
** Official channels
*** Again, who has access, and what are the backups?
*** There is an official [[Twitter]]: [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp]
*** There is an official [[GitHub]]: [https://github.com/indieweb/ IndieWeb]
** For projects we depend on, e.g. the Slack bridge, should they be mirrored to the indieweb GitHub account? That way the community has them even if the original author decides the remove their repository.
** Third parties we depend on? Can more of these be self-hosted?
*** Currently the wiki login only works through [[IndieAuth.com]].
* For IWC organising, is it interesting to state kid friendliness somewhere?

* Redirect [[IRC People]] to something less about chat plumbing?
** I like that we've moved away from linking "IRC" in pages and instead use "discuss". To go along with that, it seems like this page should follow suit. "Chat people" sounds hokey, but maybe something like "Chat community," "Discussion community," or similar. Possible issue: ensure the chat.indieweb.org logs follow the redirect. <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/3473/profile-2016-med.jpg}}  [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 15:11, 2 January 2018 (PST)
* Plan a [[microformats2]] parsing/issues breakout session during IWS day 1 afternoon
** Make sure we have (perhaps pre-slotted?) a mf2 parsing / parsers dev session to do our best to resolve any outstanding issues and brainstorming one way or another (may need to explicitly move any remaining open/ambiguous/unresolved items from these pages to GH issue per mf2 change control), leaving these pages as either historical archives, or subject-specific FAQs

== planning considerations ==
* Location requires good internet for streaming
* Some kind of conference room microphone or professional videoconference setup (Mozilla locations have [[Vidyo]], which has worked well)
** see also: [[remote participation]]
* time: due to the international nature of the community, good times are mornings on the US west coast and evenings in Europe (e.g. [[2017/Leaders]] was at 09:00 PDT (UTC-7) == 16:00 UTC == 18:00 CEST (UTC+2)
