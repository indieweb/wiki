=== Planned packages ===
* 2015-10-07 [https://davidpeach.co.uk David Peach] has begun planning out a package for easy IndieWeb adoption with Laravel 5.1. Will work as a package includeable through composer.
** 2017-02-21 I have since moved back to WordPress after having lost my server. May attempt at a rebuild at some point soon.
** 2018-01-16 I am now considering the re-building of my website, this time with Laravel 5.5, then import my old posts into it. Mostly to get my head back into coding. Will share what I learn as I learn.

* ^^^ <blockquote><p>The comment section of this blog used to be powered by Disqus. At its core, Disqus works pretty well. But I don't like the fact that it pulls in a lot of JavaScript to make it work. It's also not the prettiest UI.</p><p>I've recently replaced Disqus comments with webmentions.</p></blockquote>
