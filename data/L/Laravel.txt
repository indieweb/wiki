** 2017-02-21 I have since moved back to WordPress after having lost my server. May attempt at a rebuild at some point soon.
** 2018-01-16 I am now considering the re-building of my website, this time with Laravel 5.5, then import my old posts into it. Mostly to get my head back into coding. Will share what I learn as I learn.
