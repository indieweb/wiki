=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} has been syndicating posts to his Lobste.rs account [https://lobste.rs/u/jamietanna jamietanna] since 2019-05-22.

He does this manually for posts that he wants to syndicate, and adds the `u-syndication` markup just as a way to share the fact that it has/will be syndicated there (but does not contain a permalink to the posted link, just a link to lobste.rs).
