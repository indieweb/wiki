'''<dfn>LAMP</dfn>''' is a acronym for [[Linux]] + [[Apache]] + [[MySQL]] and (usually) [[PHP]].

Most IndieWeb sites are running on some variant of LAMP stack, though there are common exceptions like:
* [[nginx]] instead of [[Apache]]
* [[file-storage]] instead of any database (per [[database-antipattern]])
* Another programming language (Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc) instead of PHP.
* [[MongoDB]] or [[Postgresql]] instead of MySQL.
