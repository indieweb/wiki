Linux (also sometimes referred to as GNU/Linux) is an operating system kernel and name for a variety of operating system distributions (or distros) that contain Linux.

Linux is [[open source software]] and is considered one of the free major operating systems for desktop computing alongside Windows and macOS.

Linux is also most commonly used on servers, so many IndieWeb sites are [[web hosting|hosted]] on Linux servers. Many people will interact with Linux via [[SSH]].
