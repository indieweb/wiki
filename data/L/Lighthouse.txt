'''<dfn>Lighthouse</dfn>''' is a upcoming [[project|product]] run by {{JackyAlcine}} that provides a hosted low-touch [[Webmention]] service.

== Dashboard ==
Some information that'll be immediately visible:
* send and receive counts over the last week
* in-line previews of the last 5 mentions
* moderation status

== Features ==
=== Endpoint Detection and Checking ===
Lighthouse provides a tool to determine if a site (namely a provided URL) has [[Webmention]] support (exposure of a [[Webmention]] endpoint on the page).

=== Send Previews ===
A diagnostic tool that'll show information about what links on a provided page will receive Webmentions if sent from Lighthouse. The goal is, in this order, to:

* highlight which links were extracted
* determine the confidence of this Webmention being received (against MF2, OpenGraph, JSON-LD, etc)

=== Automatic Sending ===
A few different methods for automatically sending Webmentions on behalf of your site.

* hitting an authorized endpoint for sending Webmentions (following the [https://webmention.net/draft/#sending-webmentions specification] on how to do that).
* subscribing to multiple feeds on a site (using [[WebSub]] or falling back to polling every 5 to 15 minutes)

=== Relaying Webmentions ===
You can use Lighthouse to serve as a 'middleman' for your Webmentions; a place to capture them before they're sent to your server.
