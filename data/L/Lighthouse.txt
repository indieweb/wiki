'''<dfn>Lighthouse</dfn>''' is a [[project|product]] run by {{JackyAlcine}} that provides a hosted low-touch [[Webmention]] service.

== Features ==
=== Endpoint Detection and Checking ===
Lighthouse provides a tool to determine if a site (namely a provided URL) has [[Webmention]] support (exposure of a [[Webmention]] endpoint on the page).

=== Send Previews ===
A diagnostic tool that'll show information about what links on a provided page will receive Webmentions if sent from Lighthouse. The goal is, in this order, to:

* highlight which links were extracted
* determine the confidence of this Webmention being received (against MF2, OpenGraph, JSON-LD, etc)
