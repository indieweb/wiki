'''<dfn>Lighthouse</dfn>''' is a [[Webmention]], [[Microsub]], and [[WebSub]] server built by {{jacky}} to provide a means of handling engagement with other websites.

The source code for the project is available at [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse git.jacky.wtf]. It's written in [[Rust]] and meant to be distributed as a single binary with everything bundled within to make the act of deployment simple.

== Planned Features ==
* Account management facilitated with [[IndieAuth]], supporting [[TicketAuth]]
* Automated checking of endpoint presence on ''canary pages'' (a page that's expected to always have an endpoint visible on it)
* Multi-tenant (many people can sign in and use)

=== [[reader|Reader]] ===
* Customizable by users
** User-defined views via Web Components
*** to power rendering of a feed
*** or that of an item in a feed
*** or a [[hovercard]] (or sub-components within)
** Applicable user-specific stylesheets via CSS variables
* Share UX
** Provides a rendering of the linked content
** [[webactions]]
* Uses [[WebSub]] and [[Webmention]] retrival info to update replies to items as they're broadcasted


=== [[Webmentions]] ===
* In- and out-bound Webmention management
* Caching of parsed microformats and [[JF2]] of inbound Webmentions at the ID level (with post-type hints)
* [[Atom]] and [[h-feed]] URLs for Webmentions per in-bound endpoint (filterable by URL and last-modified-at )
* Separate endpoints for sending and receiving Webmentions
* Automatic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use TOFU]-esuqe Vouch URL usage (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse/issues/10)
* Allow for adjusting what URLs can recieve Webmentions sent to (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse/issues/13)
* Private Webmention sending and fetching + providing a token endpoint to use for private Webmention (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse/issues/11)
* Automatic sending of Webmentions when a feed updates (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse/issues/18)
* Web-based backfeed by using <code>rel=canonical</code> and <code>u-syndication</code> (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse/issues/16)

=== [[Microsub]] ===
* Supporting multiple feed types
** [[h-feed]]
** [[Atom]]
** [[RSS]]
** [[AS2]]

=== [[WebSub]] ===
* Subscription information on a per-URL basis
* Proxying WebSub subscriptions over WebSockets, EventSource and paginated GET (tracking at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse/issues/22)
* Federation support (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/lighthouse/issues/22)

==== [[federation|Federation]] ====
Lighthouse should take in a concept of “external hubs” and allow for users to have Lighthouse act as a meta-subscriber for the external hubs. By listening for the same URLs it sends requests for on external hubs, Lighthouse can pull in those updates and treat them as local ones. The hub that it was fetched from ''should'' be kept for reference.

=== Web Components ===
[https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/argand/issues Argand] is a collection of Web Components that can use the URL of a Webmention endpoint capable of fetching for a target to render into a social feed. That can allow for custom rendering on the site (facepile for likes and RSVP counters).
