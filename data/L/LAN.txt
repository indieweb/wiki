'''<dfn>LAN</dfn>''' is an acronym for Local Area Network, a computer network limited to a small area, often a room, or perhaps the floor of building, often based on a single router or WiFi network name; in-person [[IndieWebCamp]] participants often use the same local area network with their laptops and mobile devices on wifi.
