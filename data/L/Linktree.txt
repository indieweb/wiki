'''<dfn>[https://linktr.ee/ Linktree]</dfn>''' is a '''[[link in bio]]''' service for publishing a flat list of links at a short vanity path (like Twitter and other [[social media]] silos) for what appears to be for the sole purpose of effectively linking to multiple sites from social media profiles like Instagram which only allow one clickable link in a profile.

== Why ==
{{main|link_in_bio#Why}}

The use-cases for the Linktree silo are the same in general as [[link_in_bio#Why|link in bio use-cases]], in particular the ability to share a single link, either in a [[social media]] profile or in a message to someone, which the reader can click to then explore a handful of destinations.

== Why not ==
Make a simple [[homepage]] instead: https://twitter.com/v21/status/1486377898948898823
<blockquote>a "homepage" is like a linktree, except decentralized and also you can design it however you like.</blockquote> [https://v21.io @v21] January 26, 2022

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Make a [[link in bio]] page on your personal site instead!

== Criticism ==
Criticism of the Linktree silo in particular:
=== Bans sex workers ===
* 2022-01-14 [https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmjpk/linktree-banned-removed-inappropriate-use-sex-work Linktree Is Kicking Many Sex Workers Off Its Site] <blockquote>Linktree billed them for the service (which costs $9 a month if you’re using the “pro” subscription version) and then canceled their account without refund.</blockquote>
=== Used to spread misinformation ===
Ironically in contrast to the other criticism:
* 2021-08-06 [https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linktree-link-in-bio-instagram-tiktok-antivax-conspiracy-problem Why antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists love Linktree] / The popular “link in bio” service presents a sneaky way for crackpots to get their ideas out there.

===Leaning into web3 hype===
Has fallen into the [[web3]]/[[NFT]] deep end

}} <q>With this launch, Linktree is providing meaningful features to empower creators in the Web3 space,” Linktree CEO Alex Zaccaria told TechCrunch. “This adds value by extending the core utility of NFTs – verified ownership, monetization, and community. As the number of creators tapping into web3 grows, Linktree provides these creators the tools they need to display their NFTs anywhere they have their Linktree link and to provide exclusive incentives to their community.</q>

===Requires JS===
Links don't work on Linktree pages if JS doesn't load.

=== Outages ===
* 2024-03-24 [https://hachyderm.io/@danderson @danderson]: via [https://hachyderm.io/@danderson/112148383328510354 Mastodon] <blockquote>F in chat for linktr.ee, who let their domain registration expire 2 weeks ago. TLD NS records got pulled today, so once the cached TTLs run down...Still got another month to grab it back before it becomes available for purchase, but still, oof.</blockquote>

== Brainstorming ==
=== linktree page ===
Has anyone has used the brandname recognition of Linktree to their advantage for such links?

E.g. rather than 
* <code>linktr.ee/example.com</code>
you could make a
* <code>example.com/linktree</code>
as a page on your own site or as a redirect your "links" page (like Andy Bell's above) and then use that link in "social media profiles" just because people have been taught to click on something that is called a linktree (or has "linktree" in a short URL)

* {{aciccarello}} With the proliferation of different services, it seems to me that [[link in bio]] is a broadly accepted phrase that isn't tied to one brand.
* [[link in bio#IndieWeb_Examples]] shows <code>/link</code> is the most commonly used path.

===IndieWeb Feature Requests===
* 2022-12-02 [https://linktr.ee/davidaugust @DavidAugust] ([https://www.davidaugust.com/ personal site]) requested [[rel-me]] support: via [https://twitter.com/DavidAugust/status/1598721987920236546 Twitter] <blockquote>@Linktree_ feature request: if you could add rel=me to links on our profiles, or let us add them, it would help machines understand what profiles are ours. <br><br>Like on Mastodon, it would verify our Linktrees links: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification<br><br>More on rel=me: https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me</blockquote>
