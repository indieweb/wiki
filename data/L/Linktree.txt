'''<dfn>[https://linktr.ee/ Linktree]</dfn>''' is a [[link in bio]] service for publishing a flat list of links at a short vanity path (like Twitter and other [[social media]] silos) for what appears to be for the sole purpose of seeming to provide multiple links from social media profiles like Instagram which only allow one clickable link in your profile.

* 2022-01-14 [https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmjpk/linktree-banned-removed-inappropriate-use-sex-work Linktree Is Kicking Many Sex Workers Off Its Site] <blockquote>Linktree billed them for the service (which costs $9 a month if you’re using the “pro” subscription version) and then canceled their account without refund.</blockquote>

== Brainstorming ==
=== linktree page ===
Has anyone has used the brandname recognition of Linktree to their advantage for such links?

E.g. rather than 
* <code>linktr.ee/example.com</code>
you could make a
* <code>example.com/linktree</code>
as a page on your own site or as a redirect your "links" page (like Andy Bell's above) and then use that link in "social media profiles" just because people have been taught to click on something that is called a linktree (or has "linktree" in a short URL)
