{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://linktr.ee/ Linktree]</dfn>''' is a site for publishing a flat list of links at a short vanity path (like Twitter and other [[social media]] silos) for what appears to be for the sole purpose of seeming to provide multiple links from social media profiles like Instagram which only allow one clickable link in your profile.

(needs screenshots, on mobile and on laptop)

== Why ==
Why have a page links styled as buttons with center-aligned text that looks simple / unconfusing on a mobile device (No reason why to use the Linktree [[silo]] in particular)
* collect links around causes for easy sharing on a wide range of social media silos/"platforms"
** e.g. https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/

Why use the Linktree silo in particular:
* Possibly: adding links to your [[social media]] profile that resist scanning by the social media site. For example, [[Instagram]] will remove any account with obvious adult site links but they won't if those links are behind a linktree link.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
