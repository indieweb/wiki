'''<dfn>[https://linktr.ee/ Linktree]</dfn>''' is a [[link in bio]] service for publishing a flat list of links at a short vanity path (like Twitter and other [[social media]] silos) for what appears to be for the sole purpose of seeming to provide multiple links from social media profiles like Instagram which only allow one clickable link in your profile.

{{main|link_in_bio#Why}}

== Why not ==
Make a simple [[homepage]] instead: https://twitter.com/v21/status/1486377898948898823
<blockquote>a "homepage" is like a linktree, except decentralized and also you can design it however you like.</blockquote> [https://v21.io @v21] January 26, 2022

== Criticism ==
=== Bans sex workers ===
* 2022-01-14 [https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmjpk/linktree-banned-removed-inappropriate-use-sex-work Linktree Is Kicking Many Sex Workers Off Its Site] <blockquote>Linktree billed them for the service (which costs $9 a month if you’re using the “pro” subscription version) and then canceled their account without refund.</blockquote>
=== Used to spread misinformation ===
Ironically in contrast to the other criticism:
* 2021-08-06 [https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linktree-link-in-bio-instagram-tiktok-antivax-conspiracy-problem Why antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists love Linktree] / The popular “link in bio” service presents a sneaky way for crackpots to get their ideas out there.

== Brainstorming ==
=== linktree page ===
Has anyone has used the brandname recognition of Linktree to their advantage for such links?

E.g. rather than 
* <code>linktr.ee/example.com</code>
you could make a
* <code>example.com/linktree</code>
as a page on your own site or as a redirect your "links" page (like Andy Bell's above) and then use that link in "social media profiles" just because people have been taught to click on something that is called a linktree (or has "linktree" in a short URL)

* Criticism: you had one job. Links don't work on Linktree pages if JS doesn't load.

** "@Linktree_ feature request: if you could add rel=me to links on our profiles, or let us add them, it would help machines understand what profiles are ours. <br><br>Like on Mastodon, it would verify our Linktrees links: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification<br><br>More on rel=me: https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me" [https://linktr.ee/davidaugust @DavidAugust] December 2, 2022

** "F in chat for linktr.ee, who let their domain registration expire 2 weeks ago. TLD NS records got pulled today, so once the cached TTLs run down...Still got another month to grab it back before it becomes available for purchase, but still, oof."
