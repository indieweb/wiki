'''<dfn>[https://linktr.ee/ Linktree]</dfn>''' is a site for publishing a flat list of links at a short vanity path (like Twitter and other [[social media]] silos) for what appears to be for the sole purpose of seeming to provide multiple links from social media profiles like Instagram which only allow one clickable link in your profile.

(needs screenshots, on mobile and on laptop)

* [[about.me]]
* Possible use-case: adding links to your [[social media]] profile that resist scanning by the social media site. For example, [[Instagram]] will remove any account with obvious adult site links but they won't if those links are behind a linktree link.
* Alternative: carrd.co
* Example uses out side of profile linking: to collect links around causes for easy sharing on a wide range of platforms, https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/
