{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://linktr.ee/ Linktree]</dfn>''' is a site for publishing a flat list of links at a short vanity path (like Twitter and other [[social media]] silos) for what appears to be for the sole purpose of seeming to provide multiple links from social media profiles like Instagram which only allow one clickable link in your profile.

[[File:linktree screenshot.png|300px|link=https://linktr.ee/linktr.ee|alt=Linktree page of linktree company with a summary and featured links]]

== Why ==
Why have a page with a vertical stack of links styled as buttons with center-aligned text that looks simple / unconfusing on a mobile device (No reason why to use the Linktree [[silo]] in particular)?
* collect links around causes for easy sharing on a wide range of social media silos/"platforms"
** e.g. https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/

Why use the Linktree silo in particular:
* Possibly: adding links to your [[social media]] profile that resist scanning by the social media site. For example, [[Instagram]] will remove any account with obvious adult site links but they won't if those links are behind a linktree link.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb Examples of things that look/act like what Linktree does, without actually having to use Linktree.

* Andy Bell: https://andy-bell.co.uk/links/
** actually references Linktree by name in the page description
* {{aciccarello}}: https://www.ciccarello.me/links/
** Adapted mobile-focused style and added QR code to open on phone
** Currently a distinct list but considering listing pinned bookmarks
* {{aaronpk}}: https://aaronpk.tv/links/
** Modified a theme from [https://github.com/MichaelBarney/LinkFree LinkFree]
** Shows a thumbnail of the 3 most recent Instagram posts, linking to the link mentioned in the post
** Shows other related links below
** At the bottom has links to the main website and other profiles

== Brainstorming ==
=== linktree page ===
Has anyone has used the brandname recognition of Linktree to their advantage for such links?

E.g. rather than 
* <code>linktr.ee/example.com</code>
you could make a
* <code>example.com/linktree</code>
as a page on your own site or as a redirect your "links" page (like Andy Bell's above) and then use that link in "social media profiles" just because people have been taught to click on something that is called a linktree (or has "linktree" in a short URL)

WordPress Themes
* There's a old (predating 2010-06-17) [https://wordpress.org/themes/minicard/ MiniCard] WordPress theme by [https://mikejolley.com/about/ Mike Jolley] which visually has a similar look to Linktree which is described as a [[business card site]] for displaying social media sites that had built in vCard/hCard support. 
** An example of the theme can be found in use on [http://enkerli.com/ Alex Enkerli]'s website.
