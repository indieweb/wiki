=== How to PESETAS ===
How to [[PESETAS]] your music [[listen]]s into Last.fm:
* go to https://www.last.fm/settings/applications and connect to other music sites, like [[Spotify]], and you can collect recent (& future) listens in your Last.fm profile. See more: https://support.last.fm/t/spotify-scrobbling/189
** When you click Connect next to "Spotify Scrobbling", last.fm will retrieve ~5 past days of listens from Spotify and use that information to show "Top Artists", "Top Albums", and "Top Tracks" on your public profile

* [https://lastfmstats.com LastFMStats] is a service for visualising scrobbles/listening history of a specific user account, with downloadable graphs and data; could be be used for PESOS. If you have experiencing using this, please help expand this section.

* 2016-09-05: {{davidmead}} found a blog post dated 2016-07-02 about 3rd party [https://github.com/xiffy/lastfmrss open source code] for [http://xiffy.nl/blog/lastfm-rss-feeds Last.FM RSS feeds]. This offers feeds for tracks listened to and loved. Implemented this on [http://davidjohnmead.com/blog/tag/Last.FM/ my own site] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20190405120936/http://davidjohnmead.com/blog/tag/Last.FM/ archived]) using [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpematico/ WPeMatico plugin] to pull in the feed and create a Wordpress post.
** 2023-08-10: David's last.fm page is 404 now and includes the note "On December 2nd 2019 I deleted all my content, and started fresh." He has a "listen" tag which may include newer information: https://davidjohnmead.com/tags/listen/

== Criticism ==
=== 2015-08-18 Release Cut Features ===
2015-08-18: [https://twitter.com/cygnoir/status/633605332703576064 So @lastfm rolled out their redesign today and it removes features that made it great. Yet another case for #indieweb.]

== Alternatives ==
[https://libre.fm/listen.php Libre.fm] is a music community website that aims to provide a free software replacement for [[Last.fm]].
