=== 2015-08-18 Release Cut Features ===
2015-08-18: [https://twitter.com/cygnoir/status/633605332703576064 So @lastfm rolled out their redesign today and it removes features that made it great. Yet another case for #indieweb.]


== PESOS ==
2016-09-05: David John Mead found a blog post dated 2016-07-02 about 3rd party [https://github.com/xiffy/lastfmrss open source code] for [http://xiffy.nl/blog/lastfm-rss-feeds Last.FM RSS feeds]. This offers feeds for tracks listened to and loved. Implemented this on [http://davidjohnmead.com/blog/tag/Last.FM/ my own site] using [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpematico/ WPeMatico plugin] to pull in the feed and create a Wordpress post.

== Alternatives ==
[https://libre.fm/listen.php Libre.fm] is a music community website that aims to provide a free software replacement for [[Last.fm]].
