'''<dfn>[https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org LinuxFest Northwest]</dfn>''' ('''LFNW''') is an annual Spring FLOSS conference in Bellingham, WA.

LinuxFest Northwest is notable for having run for over 25 years, albeit with some difficulties organizationally during the 2020's. It returned with a significant and good chunk of participation but less than some previous years before those dates.

It has featured speakers such as the Board Chair of the Linux Professional Institute Jon Hall - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer).
