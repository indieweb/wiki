'''<dfn>[https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org LinuxFest Northwest]</dfn>''' ('''LFNW''') is an annual Spring FLOSS conference in Bellingham, WA, USA.

LinuxFest Northwest has run for over 25 years, albeit with some difficulties organizationally during the 2020's. It returned with significant and excellent participation but less attendance than some previous years before those dates (See: Wikipedia entry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinuxFest_Northwest).

Some suggestions have been made to move the event to Seattle, but no venue has appeared that is an improvement and also as available as the hosting venue Bellingham Technical College. 

It has featured distinguished Linux figures such as the Board Chair of the Linux Professional Institute Jon Hall https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer) and Donald Becker https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Becker
