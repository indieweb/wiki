* [[User:danielpietzsch.com|Daniel Pietzsch]] is using Letterboxd to post movie reviews, and then syndicates them to his own site at https://danielpietzsch.com/watched/movies/. A custom script (i.e. a Jekyll plugin) uses Letterboxd’s RSS feed to import the info and further page scraping to get infos about the director and whether he marked a film as “Liked”.

** ''"You can auto-publish content from your profile’s [[RSS]] feed (namely new diary entries/reviews and lists) to selected third-party services using a service such as [[IFTTT]]. IFTTT has example applets for X/[[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[WordPress]] and others. Publishing to [[Facebook]] is no longer supported due to past policy changes."''
