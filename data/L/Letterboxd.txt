* [[User:danielpietzsch.com|Daniel Pietzsch]] is using Letterboxd to post movie reviews, and then syndicates them to his own site at https://danielpietzsch.com/watched/movies/. A custom script (i.e. a Jekyll plugin) uses Letterboxd’s RSS feed to import the info and further page scraping to get infos about the director and whether he marked a film as “Liked”.
