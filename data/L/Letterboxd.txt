'''<dfn>[https://letterboxd.com/ Letterboxd]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] for keeping track of films and [[review|reviews]] in what they call a “film diary”, and supports the [[rel-me]] IndieWeb [[building block]].

They also have the ability to create lists including watchlists (aka [[want|wants]]) and [[follow]] your friends.

== IndieWeb Friendly ==
* '''[[rel-me]]'''. Letterboxd supports the [[rel-me]] [[building block]] for the link back to your personal site since at least 2023-12.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{section-stub}}
IndieWeb folks using Letterboxd with some connection to their personal site, e.g. with their personal site on their Letterboxd profile (auto-linked with [[rel-me]]), or [[POSSE]]/[[PESOS]] their film [[review]]s and [[watch]] posts.

* [[User:danielpietzsch.com|Daniel Pietzsch]] is using Letterboxd to post movie reviews, and then syndicates them to his own site at https://danielpietzsch.com/watched/movies/. A custom script (i.e. a Jekyll plugin) uses Letterboxd’s RSS feed to import the info and further page scraping to get infos about the director and whether he marked a film as “Liked”.
* {{benji}} used to [[PESOS]] from letterboxd to his site using [https://github.com/benjifs/letterboxd-import this script]. Now, he posts on his site directly using [[Sparkles]] and every so often uses [https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/ letterboxd's import feature] with a custom [https://benji.dog/letterboxd.csv CSV using the format letterboxd expects] to [[POSSE]] manually.
* {{MD87}} imported all his Letterboxd reviews and lists to his site at [https://chameth.com/films/ /films] and now makes changes/writes new reviews there and manually [[POSSE]]s them to Letterboxd

== How to PESOS ==

* [https://letterboxd.com/about/faq/#auto-publish Letterboxd FAQ: Can I auto-publish my reviews to other sites?]
** ''"You can auto-publish content from your profile’s [[RSS]] feed (namely new diary entries/reviews and lists) to selected third-party services using a service such as [[IFTTT]]. IFTTT has example applets for X/[[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[WordPress]] and others. Publishing to [[Facebook]] is no longer supported due to past policy changes."''

== Issues ==

URLs for existing Letterboxd reviews change if you review a film a second time. With one review it will be found at <code>https://letterboxd.com/USER/film/FILM/</code>, but once you add another that URL will start returning a [[404]] error and you have to use the URL <code>https://letterboxd.com/USER/film/FILM/1/</code> instead. The <code>/1/</code> URL doesn't work if there is a single review, so there is no way to create a permanent URL. This can be problematic if you maintain a [[posts-elsewhere]] section.
