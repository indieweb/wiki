Now that you have a great domain name, and a place that will host your website, we need to set up [[DNS]] in a way that when somebody types your domain name into their browser, they will talk to your website's host. That's the purpose of this section.

'''Prerequisite:''' you need to know the IP address of your website's host. The IP address consists of four numbers, separated by dots, such as 1.2.3.4 or 113.210.1.4. You got that IP address when you set up the server for your site.

== Setting up DNS at hover.com so your domain name points to your website ==

{|class="steps"
| 1.
| When you are logged into hover.com, select "Your Account" and "Domains" from the top-right corner.

| 2.
| Then, select the domain name you wish to configure.

|-
| 3.
| Ignore all the partner advertisements, and click on the "DNS" menu towards to the top right.

|-
| 4.
| Currently, there are four lines listed, two of them of type "A", one of type "MX" and one of type "CNAME".

|-
| 5.
| You can leave the "MX" and "CNAME" lines in place, but we need to change both "A" lines. We will do the same thing for both of those lines:
* Click on the EDIT button
* Leave the "hostname" field alone
* Change the IP Address field to your site's IP address
* Leave the TTL along
* Click "Save changes".

|-
| 6.
| After you have done this for both "A" records, both lines of type "A" should now show your IP address in the Value column.

Done!
