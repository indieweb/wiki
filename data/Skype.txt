'''<dfn>[http://skype.com/ Skype]</dfn>''' is a [[communication]] service that provides text [[chat]], and audio/video calling service via native applications on desktop (Mac, Windows), and [[mobile]] (iOS, Android).

You can purchase "credit" on Skype and use it to make audio calls to telephone numbers.

== Issues ==
=== Lacks skype URL support on Fedora ===
Apparently on Fedora Linux, even when you install the Skype app, click on "skype:" URLs fails to launch the Skype app.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-24#t1408916186709]. This issue is present on the latest versions.

Basically, installing the Skype app does not automatically configure a handler. This would mean you would either have to script or manually add this functionality. And this would differ based on the Window manager.

== Criticism ==
=== Credit deactivation ===
If you don't use your Skype credit for 180 days, it becomes inactive.

"Once it becomes inactive, you can reactivate it whenever you're ready to use it. Simply sign into your account online and follow the option to Reactivate credit." - per email received by [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Ã‡elik]] on 2014-04-29 with subject "Your credit will become inactive in 7 days".
