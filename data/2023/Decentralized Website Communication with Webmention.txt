== Description ==

<blockquote>
Personal websites are a place to call home on the web. You control how your content is published and presented on your website. A common refrain is that personal websites aren't social: often, people will comment elsewhere (email, Twitter). With Webmention, this is no longer the case. You can like, bookmark, and comment on websites that support Webmention on your own site and your comments will show up on their sites.
</blockquote>

This talk covered:

* What is the Webmention protocol?
* How can you start receiving Webmentions on your personal website?
* How can you send your first Webmention?
* Creative possibilities for information exchange on personal websites.
