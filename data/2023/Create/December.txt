gRegor
* mentioned to Al how I use [[granary]] to convert microformats2 into Atom, makes it easier than managing Atom feeds myself. Example with my notes feed: https://gregorlove.com/notes.atom which redirects to granary, which is converting directly from the HTML microformats2 https://gregorlove.com/notes/

{{gwg}} was working on trying to fix Micropub WordPress plugin issues. Pending feedback.
* Updated Location plugin so can filter by location and then only see venues in that area, otherwise venue list is really long.
* WordPress Webmention plugin now stores a copy of the avatar, previously were hotlinked, so older posts have missing avatars with the default generic avatar.
* Fixed markup on homepage

Customizing wiki:
* Example: https://indieweb.org/User:Gregorlove.com/vector.css
