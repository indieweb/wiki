** I have my h-card in the footer to be working - used https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-card/ and it's great - I made changes to my footer that blew away several of the bits of markup I had before
** I got distracted and tried PabloDraw - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PabloDraw - https://picoe.ca/products/pablodraw/ - which is more of a tool for Demoscene image creation but also can be used to create ASCII art
** First Second Third goal is to validate that the markup I have on individual posts for indieweb is correct... and I was able to use https://indiewebify.me/ to update the single post - canonical urls for my blog posts so that they show satisfactory data when run against indiewebify against it.
