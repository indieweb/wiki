If you're interested in hosting a '''<dfn>2023 IndieWeb Pop-up Session</dfn>''', use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

If you instead want to see a session happen or want someone else to host a session on a topic, please bring it up in IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] and see if you can find someone interested to host (and have them add it to the wiki instead of you).

The session planning/development progresses on this page, by trying to get a core group of individuals who advise availability and interest, with sufficient time for others to join as well.

Once you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]]. See our guidance for [[Pop-up Organizing|organizing pop-ups]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for the future.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2023_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.
