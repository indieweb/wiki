If you're interested in hosting a '''<dfn>2023 IndieWeb Pop-up Session</dfn>''', use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

If you instead want to see a session happen or want someone else to host a session on a topic, please bring it up in IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] and see if you can find someone interested to host (and have them add it to the wiki instead of you).

The session planning/development progresses on this page, by trying to get a core group of individuals who advise availability and interest, with sufficient time for others to join as well.

Once you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]]. See our guidance for [[Pop-up Organizing|organizing pop-ups]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for the future.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2023_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.

== Microformats Roundtable ==
Let's work through and discuss some of the open Microformats issue trackers. The proposal is to schedule 60, 90, or 120 minutes at a regular interval, either every month, every other month, or every 3 months, so we can finally address some of the long-standing microformats issues we have in the community. If we choose an alternating schedule, we can have different people from our various timezones each time.

Proposed:
* Name: Microformats Popup: Microformats2 Issues Resolution Session
* Description: (draft, feel free to edit/improve) <blockquote><p>Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.</p><p>Let's discuss how we can close out some outstanding microformats2 issues.</p><p>This is an intermediate session, with a prerequisite of basic knowledge of HTML and microformats. Experience with publishing and/or parsing is a plus. All are welcome.</p><p>More details will be posted over time</p></blockquote>

=== Prerequisites ===

At the [[2020/Pop-ups/Microformats]] session, there were several takeaways that would be good to resolve before trying another session. Specifically,

* perhaps a flow diagram of how a property can advance from proposed > draft > core
* what are the requirements / is the process to iterate on a Proposed property?
* what are the requirements / is the process to iterate on a Draft property?
* explicit lists of steps to follow to add a proposed property (with example "what specific real world use-cases they are solving, preferably with a link to a step-by-step user scenario, e.g. demonstratable using existing non-standard / single-site / single-implementation tools"), and transition a property from proposed to draft to core
* GitHub [[project labels]] to indicate the current state, and next-action(s) for individual proposals
* perhaps a flow diagram of the process for how a whole new microformat is developed and can be advance into a draft proposal and further
** using [[h-app]] as a live example that is actively being supported
** update https://microformats.org/wiki/process#Exploratory_Discussions accordingly
** higher level reasons / discussions of when to explore a new property for an existing microformat vs a new microformat

If we do not at least have a detailed proposal on this to discuss, then any discussion of stabilization will not be successful.

* Make it easy to support OAuth sign-ins on federated platforms like Mastodon and [https://forgejo.org/ Forgejo] alongside IndieAuth
* Advocate for IndieAuth in federated platforms
