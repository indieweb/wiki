'''<dfn>Session scheduling</dfn>''' at [[2023/SD|IndieWebCamp San Diego 2023]]. 

Scheduling took place in the etherpad instead of by Post-it notes on a schedule grid. A lot of information ended up on [[2023/SD/Schedule]] already, but archiving the etherpad here for completeness.

* Archived from https://etherpad.indieweb.org/IndieWebCamp_San_Diego

== Session Proposals ==
Three things: session name, session hashtag, and your name!

=== IndieWeb For Newbies R&D Project ===
* #indienewbies, {{alabut}} 
* Interested:
** James likes this :) 
** Pete :) 
** Joe :) 
** Sara 
** Tantek
** Angelo 
** Isaac 
** {{aciccarello}}
** Pablo
** {{gwg}} this might be useful: Building Blocks maybe?  How about this to start? [[2018/Baltimore/Building_Blocks#Domain_Name]]
** This might be too... https://archive.org/details/myfirstindiewebcamp-iwc-berlin2-2019

=== Joe's Open Graph Protocol WordPress plugin and publishing ===
* #opengraphpublishing, {{artlung}} 
** Tantek is interested (especially in context of the publishing solutions in [[link-preview]]), who else? angelo interested, Isaac interested
** {{gwg}} shows up for OGP and WordPress
** Problem being solved: publishing for external consuming code
** Plugin: OpenGraph Protocol Tools https://wordpress.org/plugins/open-graph-protocol-tools
** {{aciccarello}}: figure out what's actually being used in the wild, and what makes sense to map to what microformats
** Pete suggests this is a way to get interest from people who are familiar with Open Graph but not (yet) IndieWeb; as Joe said, "if you like publishing info via OG, maybe you'll really like IndieWeb"

=== Follow Your Nose replace or fallback for the use-cases that people use WebFinger ===
* #FYND, {{t}}
** Who is interested in this? Joe is interested. Pete likes this. {{gwg}} likes this {{chrisaldrich}}  Isaac is interested
* Tantek: understand the use cases of webfinger
** Figure out a "follow your nose"-style replacement
** e.g. using rel=icon instead of /favicon.ico
** https://indieweb.org/follow_your_nose aka [[follow your nose]]

=== Murmurations ===
* Learn together about Murmurations, and maybe build community bridges between IW and Murmurations, #MurmurationsBridge {{peterkaminski}}
* Interested: {{peterkaminski}},  {{chrisaldrich}}
* Pete knows about it, but not very much
* https://murmurations.network/
* https://etherpad.indieweb.org/MurmurationsBridge

=== Aggregating movie watching and optionally reviews ===
* #movieviewings, {{benji}} 
** Inspired by Breakfast and Coffee (https://breakfastand.coffee)
** Hope to make it work similar to IndieNews, where you can syndicate content from anywhere and it would pop up.
** Sara: I have spent working today in the way to find the common movies and books based on data on the personal sites, so I would be interested in this topic
** Consuming code side of it, what is the point of having this piece of data, and how do we bring it together
** James likes this idea!
** Angelo, interested
** {{aciccarello}} is interested in reviews and possible consuming use cases
** Isaac is interested

=== Informal sandwich protocol===
* Session proposal: IndieWeb Sandwich Protocol (who?)
** Any seconders? {{eggmcmuffin}}
** What would be the IndieWeb Sandwich Protocol? We aggregate the decision making of the best sandwich?
** Yes.

<pre>
James: wants a sandwich.
Loqi: hands James a sandwich.ðŸ¥ªâ˜•
GWG: Do you want egg or just egg?
James: I have had two egg sandwiches today already. And a toasted sandwich.
Sara: I can only offer a vegetable soup, if you are up to it... Not sure if it would survive travell to another side of the continent
James: _thinks about what to say_
James: His index stopped working :facepalm:
    > TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
James: It's working!
Sara: Great! *clap*
James: Updated my index: https://capjamesg.github.io/index/
</pre>
