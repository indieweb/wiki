** James likes this :) - And Pete :) And Joe :) and Sara and Tantek and Angelo and Isaac and {{aciccarello}}


== Notes ==
* Al's thoughts: how to wrap your head about IndieWeb
* Goal: blog an explanation of an indiewebcamp
* What is IndieWeb? 
** What does Loqi / the wiki say?
*** "The IndieWeb is a community of independent & personal websites connected by simple standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain & using it as your primary identity, publishing on your own site (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data [[indieweb]]"
* Why is the indieweb?
** [[why]]
** personal web? artisanal?
** Wikipedia solves for the density problem by structured guidelines about the first sentence in any article
* Obstructions
** "I am not technical enough"
** I am not a developer
** Newbie to advanced?
** How user friendly is the onboarding?
** With Twitter diminishing and Mastodon ascendent more potential interest

* Joe: talked to his cousin about their non-commercial web interests, tried explaining it in a more "normie friendly" way
* Goal is not to dumb down the wiki
* Should ecompass the changing nature of user needs over time, 10 years ago maybe people were leaving FB, later IG, later Twitter
* Aside, Added a redirect from /wiki/indieweb to IndieWeb in Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indieweb&redirect=no

* Joe: finds himself flailing trying to describe IW; would like a single paragraph as an elevator pitch
* Tantek: three points on IW page are solid; challenge is that the reasons people are looking change over time.
** 10 years ago - someone might want to get off FB
** 5 years - get off IG
** this year - get off Twitter
** meta challenge = reasons change over time

* David: "the perception that we're a community of developers is a constant misconception"

* The wiki could have simpler pages but would need to have clearer distinction of beginner friendly pages they should look at

* Tantek: builders that are users (see [[eat your own cooking]])
* Gregor: eat your own cooking (lol)

* Indieweb intro video?
** "what is the indieweb to you?"
** 60 second trailer to feature different people; emotive, narrative, friendly and welcoming
** capture the vibe of the zoom hangout sessions in a way that scales in an async way
** photos on the home page?

* Showcasing a human touch
* artisinal made by a real person

Does the IndieWeb have a blog?
* https://stream.indieweb.org/
** Should it be linked to or discoverable from the home page?

Maybe home page could show a live more recent photo near the top to show that the IndieWeb is people
* most recent HWC photos (e.g. that were in the latest newsletter)
* most recent IWC photo
* Most recent event photo won't always be the most inclusive representation and may give a bad impression 
* Iterate on improving which links are highlighted for new people to check out

* Al: I can't be alone in that "I found my tribe" feeling
* The social motivation for indieweb is something yet to be tapped

* Tantek: putting pictures of people can also backfire; can make the society look more homogeneous or less welcoming than intended
** text is "neutral" in the identity sense, makes it more about the ideas and principles
** ok with discouraging negative people

* Joe:  
** Goal is to be maximally inviting and minimally discouraging
** Sounds like a marketing effort
** Al: I'd call that "storytelling"

Angelo:
* Home page has always been hotly contested
* Can we create a standalone page? That we all can update.
    
Tantek: You can't get it wrong, when it comes to your own blog posts, you own what you say

Tantek: Wordpress can help with hosting, but people go down the road of creating their own blog end up with an island, no broken social
* list the steps to indieweb plugin
* David's offering his help with the #wordpress channel [[discuss#wordpress]]
* wordpress outreach club
* micro.blog has social right out of the box, indieweb features are built in - short answer
