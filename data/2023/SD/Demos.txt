== Chris Aldrich ==
* {{chrisaldrich}}, https://boffosocko.com/
* brought a Smith Corona [[typewriter]] ("the Cadillac of typewriters")
* starting in 2021 wanted to hand-write notes and post to his site
* wanted to be able to '''type''' up notes and post to his site this weekend
* since early days of blogging, people would hand-write notes, post to [[Flickr]], then embed on their site
* sharing his screen
* shows an example of a typewritten index card
* goal for day was to get them sent to his site and automatic [[alt text]]
* first simple test was totally manual
* during second test, we discovered power wasn't working at the venue, so he could continue typing away and make this post
* typed up a description of how he did it: https://boffosocko.com/2023/12/17/typecasting-with-indieweb-building-blocks/
* process: type, take photo of post, open with [[Google Docs]], which automatically [[OCR]]s text
* [[IFTTT]] trigger watches the folder in Drive and takes the text + photo, sends to his site using [[Micropub]]
* Posts it privately so he can edit before making public
* publishing will also syndicate copies to [[Mastodon]], [[Bluesky]], and wherever else
* also created [[typecast]] wiki page with examples
* {{GWG}} made a suggestion for a pneumatic tube setup for the typewritten cards
** {{gRegor}} "that project sounds like it would suck"

== Joe Crawford ==
* {{artlung}}, https://artlung.com/
* has an [[Open Graph]] Plugin that hasn't been updated to support latest version of [[WordPress]]
* updated that, then also wanted to write about yesterday's [[OGP]] session and invisible code
* interested in [[link-preview]]s in [[indiewebify.me]]
* philosophically interested in "How little code can we add to our pages and still have them be functional?"

== Angelo Gladding ==
* {{angelo}}, https://ragt.ag
* worked on getting [[indieweb.rocks]] back online
* validator that you plug in a URL and reads as much as it can about the page
* wanted to get [[metaformats]] support, since recent experimental support added to [[mf2py]]
* some sites don't have [[mf2]] but do have meta tags with relevant information
* one we tested with is https://zeldman.com, which has mf2 but no [[representative h-card]]
* shows https://indieweb.rocks/www.zeldman.com
* metaformats section shows info it parsed and "coerced" into an [[h-entry]]
* working on sites pulled from https://nownownow.com that don't have any mf2 and do have metaformats
* lots more to come in metaformats space!

== Anthony Ciccarello ==
* {{aciccarello}}
* also working on metaformats, experiments to translate them into [[microformats]]
* How are meta tags being used in the wild?
* parsed a bunch of pages, getting a better sense of the use-cases
* some questions in the [https://www.ciccarello.me/blog/2023/12/04/ideas-for-improving-metaformats-parsing/ blog post] he wrote earlier this month
* shows that several of the metaformats are the same on e.g. [[YouTube]] URLs
* YouTube does include video meta tags that could be useful
* OGP also has secure_url, not sure how/if that's being used by sites
* from yesterday's session, talked about [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/116 setting up an OGP validator]
* improve guidance on the IndieWeb wiki and indiewebify.me

== Peter Kaminski ==
* {{peterkaminski}}, https://peterkaminski.wiki
* showed Isaac how to get his site set up with [[Massive Wiki]]
* got a [[Webmention]] sent from Massive Wiki to {{angelo}}
* shows his site info on https://indieweb.rocks
* Notes about day2 on his site: https://peterkaminski.wiki/indiewebcamp_san_diego_2023,_day_2

== Isaac ==
* focused on getting his site set up, https://complicatedstatus.com
* a reference to life is more complicated than what some people say it is
* Peter helped him get Massive Wiki set up

== gRegor Morrill ==
