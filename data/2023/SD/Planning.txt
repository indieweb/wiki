'''<dfn>Planning</dfn>''' for [[2023/SD|IndieWebCamp San Diego 2023]].

== Initial Planning ==
This is an archive of the initial planning for IndieWebCamp San Diego 2023, [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Planning&oldid=91175#San_Diego originally found here].

==== San Diego ====
The First Ever IndieWebCamp [[San Diego]]!

Event has been confirmed for 2023-12-16…17 at the Blackmarket Bakery. https://indieweb.org/2023/SD

Venue: 
* '''Brainstorming for December 2023''' 
** [https://www.blackmarketbakery.com/location/blackmarket-bakery-san-diego-north-park-california/ Blackmarket Bakery] (7am - 4pm) is pretty good. On 30th St. They have a nice fenced in courtyard of good size with several table sizes, shade, power, etc. I believe they have some other locations too dotted around but I can't speak for them. 
*** Note: since they close at 4pm we'd likely need another venue to continue brainstorming or for demos (like with a projector? or we use a laptop with a large screen and share window with Zoom to record it)
**** {{gwg}} has a $40 HDMI projector somewhere
** [https://seasidemarket.com/location/ Seaside Market] in Cardiff is further north (almost a midpoint to Oceanside) - has adjacent [https://www.starbucks.com/store-locator/store/14865/san-elijo-birmingham-cardiff-2081-san-elijo-avenue-a-cardiff-ca-920071735-us Starbucks] and outdoor tables.
** Encinitas is on the Coaster line and has a lot of outdoor venues.
* Maybe not:
** Most of the [https://betterbuzzcoffee.com Better Buzz]'s fit the bill but with smaller outdoor footprint - so more of a fight to get a good table. 
*** chance of "fight to get a good table" means we shouldn't depend on it for an IndieWebCamp — {{t}}
