== Notes ==
Learn together about Murmurations, and maybe build community bridges between IW and Murmurations, 
https://murmurations.network/
* "The initial use case for Murmurations was to facilitate decentralized mapping of purpose-driven and solidarity economy organizations and projects."
* M publishes via JSON with agreed-upon schemas for things like people and places
* M expects heavier-weight, more centralized aggregators than IW?
* Is Anagora similar or related in some way? Esp. from a discovery/hub standpoint
* Is Fediverse similar or related in some way?
* Brid.gy? as a means of bridging the two? 
* talking about formats: microformats, json-ld, schema
* micropub - perhaps a way to do bridging?
* is [[Gemini]] related in some way?
* is https://www.jsonfeed.org/ similar or related in some way?
* how does discovery work in M?
* is Solid similar or related in some way?
* What M projects / tools exist? Are they working more on tech, or the output of the tech?
* Why/how did Murmurations not find out about microformats and indieweb when they started building?

==Next Steps==
* Do some more independent research
* Find out, what is the use case of M? Does that dovetail with what IW provides?
* Contact some M folks?

=== Bridging ===
* Bridge communities and participants
* Create a 1-1, onto map of microformats and other formats with murmurations formats
