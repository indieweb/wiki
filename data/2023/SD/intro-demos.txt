== Joe Crawford ==

== Al Abut ==
* {{alabut}}, https://alabut.com
* A "web dork" for over 20 years now
* A blend of commercial and non-commercial web use
* Moved to SF, worked in startups for years
* Excited about the non-comemercial web, playing with things
* Forgot how much he loves web standards
* Spent time on the CSS working group
* There are things in the air with social / open standards, and people working on the web for fun
* Exciting to see people work on new things on the web
* Primarily bring a design eye; if there are things with which Al can help in terms of making microsites, making things easier, that's what he will dive into
* Here to help!

== Isaac ==
* First introduction to the IndieWeb
* Full-stack web developer, moving to back-end development
* [audio too hard to hear]
* We (all participants) will encourage you to set up a website today and work on it tomorrow!

== Angelo Gladding == 
* {{angelo}}, https://ragt.ag
* Just bought a new domain, says GWG :D
* Currently posting high-frequency code commits to my home page
* Beware of following me in a feed reader as a result
* Plan to take the weekend on long-form writing
** James says "what!" (Sara joins James in showing surprise and encouragement) :D
* Glad to be at his first in-person IndieWeb Camp

== Tantek ==
* {{t}}, https://tantek.com
* Most recent thing I did on my site was blog a brief summary of the [[Data Dialogues]] event at [[Meta Platforms|Meta's]] San Francisco office, which was invitation only but Chatham House rule applied; quote, but no attribution allowed.
* My one hack there was at the end of the presentations I invited people to join me in a group photo which would be published publicly. Most people were happy with being in the photo!
* My little way of nudging a private event to being more transparent; they were quite grateful that someone took the initiative to encourage that.
* In the follow up email to attendees, they included the photo.
* I have a longer blog post to write with my notes from the meeting.
* Lot of things he wants to work on this weekend; site enhancements, library enhancements; figure out alternatives to webfinger that we can use and share with AP implementers
* Q: for Tantek: are you the main POC in the community? Governance structure in the IWC.
** We are roughly anarchistic in that regard; decentralized. Leave it up to every city to organize their own HWC / IWCs. A lot of people volunteer to provide support. Self-determined volunteers. Every city and community decides what is right for them.
** Very much encourage decentralized decision making. That's most sustaintable. The spirit of the IWC. Nobody wants to be in charge; we want to start things and build communities!
* Session idea from Al Abut sparked; a little intimidating about how you get started. 

== David Shanske ==
* {{gwg}}, https://david.shanske.com
* Shows his name tag
* Tend to play with location-based features on my websites when travelling since it is designed for use when taking trips
* https://david.shanske.com/2023/12/14/map/
* Most recent exmaple ^
* Every time I go and do a lot of things in a short period of time, I want to improve my code
* A lot of dots in a small space which means I need to fix my maps
* Came from NY via Fort Lauderdale
* A participant in all IWC WordPress plugins
* Someone asks how many
* Somewhere between 5-10 WordPress plugins

== Peter Kaminski ==
* {{peterkaminski}}, https://peterkaminski.wiki/
* Most recent website update was adding h-card to the home page (with `display:none`, so view source or indiewebify or whatever to see it)
* Most recent project (non-IWC) is Pixie, CLI interface to GPT-4V, released this morning, https://github.com/peterkaminski/pixie
* COVID-cautious, still wearing masks when near people, even outside like at IWC SD :-)
* Long-time Internet and web tech, have known about IndieWeb and Microformats all along, but this is my first IWC
* Have been to lots of BarCamps, including the first ones (special shout out to Recent Changes Camp, the wiki camps)
* Participating in lots of small communities now, and working on intercommunity projects 
** Massive Wiki, Collective Sense Commons, Open Global Mind, MeetingWords, etc.
* Does a lot of internet stuff!

== Chris Aldrich ==
* {{chrisaldrich}}, https://boffosocko.com
* Can't count how many IWCs he has visited now—would have to look up on his site
* First was one he hosted in Los Angeles; group was supportive; took it over from someone else who moved away.
* We are working on the next one. Late summer, maybe??
* Lifted site name from The Muppets Take Manhattan
* Used the early web but didn't have a domain to ~2003
* Used boffosocko.com since ~2008.
* One of the last things he did was a setup for hand-writing posts and publishing the text to his website
** Shows post about how that works that he wrote in 2021: https://boffosocko.com/2021/12/20/handwriting-my-website-with-a-digital-amanuensis/
* Hoping to extend the feature to an old web thing called "[[typecasting]]" that works with analog [[typewriters]]
* In one photo, a click (maybe two), take text from a typewriter, post on site, and make it available to everyone

== Anthony Ciccarello ==
* {{aciccarello}}, https://ciccarello.me
* Got in the IndieWeb through having a blog
* Super active in the IndieWeb Chat
* Active in some JavaScript-focused projects like IndieKit, which he runs on his site
* Has a static-hosted website
* Getting involved with metaformats work with microformats parsers, mostly because IndieKit will use it for link previews, references, etc. Mapping existing meta tags to microformats is ideal for interoperability.
