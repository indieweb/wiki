== Notes ==
* Joschi talks about the things we get from silos, and how they might disrupt things for us.
* Having a domain name unites everyone here, a domain name is like a piece of land on the internet.
* Want to keep data on our own hands. It is not just that social networks are dumb, and you can use it still.
* Publishing something on your website and then having it go our on other places, is that what we call POSSE?
** Yes. There are different views. Sometimes you publish on your own place first, and then push to others (POSSE). And sometimes it has to work the other way around. It is hard to post to Instagram from your own, but it might be possible to retrieve it from there to y our own site (PESOS).
* The start off is almost always a domain and a place to store data.
* Can you have a domain without storage?
** You could register one and start using it for other services, like email, before having a website.
* {{jkphl}} shows an old presentation
** What did websites look like before.
** Then blogs came
** Social networks
** Site deaths
* Independence
** Have your own identity, your own place
* IndieWeb has built ways to manage some of the stuff we are known from silos also to make websites connect to eachother.
* Level 1: identity, own domain.
** Use your own domain as an identity for logging in to other site, IndieAuth.
* IndieWeb building blocks
** HTML is the first block, a way to build the website
** microformats is the second, to make information machine readable, and is used to make websites be able to read eachother and communicate with eachother.
** the presentation includes an example of an h-entry post.
* Showing https://sonja-weckenmann.de/
** A small profile. Links for writing. Great example of a first personal website.
** Using the building blocks, you would want to mark up which text has what meaning. So it becomes more machine readable. “This is my name”, “this is my bio.”
* For a first website, a single profile page is a great exercise, even without thinking about what sort of technology you would want to use.
* Now an example of h-card in the presentation.
* Shows micrometa.jkphl.is to parse jkphl.is
** It has an h-entry on the home page with a nested h-card that is extractable.
** This way HTML can become an API
* Shows how Google is using data that gets extracted. Trying to get publication dates to show. Makes an example of Google displaying ratings for a link (tollwerk on Facebook has a 4.9 with 15 reviews).
* Showing rel-me as an example of what can be done with very little microformats:
** The example in the presentation uses twitter.com, might need updates
* Showing microformats wiki to show the list of h-card properties
* The beauty is when these two super simple blocks together open up to things you did not know existed
* Some other building blocks have made it far, into W3C Recommendations.
* Webmentions:
** You might write a blog post where you mention someone else,
** if the other person also is an IndieWeb website, and accepts Webmentions, you can send a Webmention,
** the Webmention tells the receiver that you have mentioned them and where you have mentioned them, a link
** the receiver can than go and look for microformats on the provided URL to see who mentioned them.
** Example in the presentation where Tom received a Webmention.
** Example of what it looked like on Joschi’s website in 2014.
** jkphl shows the post where a mention from jeremy is showed as a comment
* Slowly it opens the door with technology to something that is self-controlled
