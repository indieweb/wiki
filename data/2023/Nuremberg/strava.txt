== Notes ==
* [[Strava]] is a possible silo
* You need not pull the data from Strava if you are not tracking your data with there app
* Strava is a nice 'hub' to get data to your site, as it has many integrations.
* from where does Strava get the data? is it collected directly by the app or by running gear and then syndicated (oauth) to Strava by garmin/...
PESOS from Strava has advantages. E.g
â€¢ It can process your GPX data
* but you can't get the GPX get out of it
* Strava can track your shoes or gear
** Strava does not let you create shoes via the API, only view them
** Strava does not let you edit shoes via the mobile app, only on the desktop website


Goals?
* first goal: use Strava embed (don't own the content at first)
* then own the data and store it (to reprocess later)
** PESOS?

* Activity in the API https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/#api-models-DetailedActivity

Can our own websites be the proxy-in-the-middle between a sports watch app and Strava?

sports watch -> sports watch app -> oauth into your personal site -> oauth into Strava

see what {{aaronpk}} posts and marks up: https://aaronparecki.com/2023/10
* he seems to mark them up with some h-measure, but not much more
    
Brainstorming
