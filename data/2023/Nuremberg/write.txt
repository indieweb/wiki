== Notes ==
* reasons  why people are here/what  stops them:
** perfectionism
** how to make site more helping towards writing
** lots of "I have this technical issue"

Observation: people don't mind talking about the tech things, but don't like writing/are slow about it

Writing text vs code:  
**code not public
**ease/familarity for workflow
**

is being ignored or widely shared more scary?

Blog posts vs "digital garden"/wiki/... - mental expectation that a blog post with a "release date" is finished vs more fluent things. 
have things marked as "drafts" publicly?

why care about that distinction?

private writing/journaling replaced motivation to put things out there.

Why even publish?
*Writing about things done makes things more real
*Thereapeutic
*technical stuff to share knowledge, get gained knowledge out to others and be able to look it up again yourself
*community aspects/similar topics/contacts
*be somewhat known under "own identity"
*"I made this website with all these cool features, I should use it"
*reference for students
