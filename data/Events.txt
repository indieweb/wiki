'''Welcome to upcoming IndieWeb <dfn>events</dfn>!'''
* ''For indie event [[posts]], see: '''[[event]]'''''
* ''For indie event listings pages, see: '''[[events list]]'''''

== Upcoming ==
Upcoming indie web related events. Feel free to add any indieweb-related events, free or paid, whole camps/conferences, or even individual indieweb related talks at conferences.
<!--
Please try to keep to neutral time tense (e.g "Bill Smith on indie web"). Include as many details about the event as possible, including precise start end times, room number, etc. Move details to the (events/..) wiki page for the event itself. Include the information here to start with with h-event markup.

templates:

one day event:

*<span class="h-event vevent"><span class="dt-start dtstart">YYYY-MM-DD</span>: <span class="p-name summary">[[events/YYYY-MM-DD-event-session-title|Event Session Title]]</span> at <span class="p-location location">event-location</span>. <span class="p-description description">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</span>. <span class="u-url url">http://example.com</span></span>

multiple day event:

*<span class="h-event vevent"><span class="dt-start dtstart">YYYY-MM-DD</span>..<abbr style="border:0" class="dt-end dtend" title="YYYY-MM-EE">EE</abbr>: <span class="p-name summary">[[events/YYYY-MM-DD-event-session-title|Event Session Title]]</span> at <span class="p-location location">event-location</span>. <span class="p-description">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</span>. <span class="u-url url">http://example.com</span></span>

For all IndieWebCamp conferences, please mark as  "big" in the top-level class (either span or div) so that they are  pulled to the front page as the next conference. All events without "big" in the class are assumed to be "small" (i.e. homebrew meetings, etc).

If it's an upcoming IndieWebCamp, use style="background:#FF9" on the h-event element to highlight it!

Soonest first. Edit after the following HTML comment closer:  *****************        -->

==== 2016 ====
Feel free to add tentative, month-level granularity, or potentially IndieWeb related (e.g. open source related) 2016 events here - helps with planning of IndieWebCamps to avoid conflicts.

=== How To Add An Event ===
To add an event to the IndieWeb Events Listing, just edit this page and copy paste one of the event templates in the source into the right most-recent-first spot in the '''Upcoming''' list above!

In addition, for [[Homebrew Website Club]] (HWC) events:
* Add it to [[Template:Homebrew Website Club]]
* Create the event permalink page for it (copy paste from a previous HWC permalink page) if necessary
* Add yourself to the RSVP on that page for the city you’re (co-)organizing
* Update [[next-hwc]], [[Main_Page]], [[Events]], and [[IRC]] /topic (or ask an admin) to link to that next HWC (assuming that is the next one)
And ideally:
* Create an indie [[event]] on your own site for the HWC for your city, ideally with [[invitation]]s to people that have previously participated.
* [[POSSE]] that indie event to one or more applicable event silos/commons of your choice (e.g. [[Calagator]], [[Facebook]])
* Add both those URLs to the section for your city 
* Be sure to have [[Bridgy]] or some other [[backfeed]] setup to receive RSVPs from the silo copy to your indie event.
* Invite folks on the silo/silos you POSSEd to, to the POSSE copy/copies.
