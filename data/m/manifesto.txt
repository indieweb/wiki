A '''<dfn>manifesto</dfn>''' is "a published verbal declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government" according to Wikipedia[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto] - in summary there is no IndieWeb(Camp) manifesto.

== No Manifesto ==
'''There is no "indieweb manifesto" nor "indiewebcamp manifesto".'''

IndieWebCamp does have
* design [[principles]]
* and a [[code-of-conduct]]
but to call either of them a manifesto would be an exaggeration and inaccurate.

== Other Manifestos ==
Separately from indieweb/indiewebcamp, others have created related manifestos:
* [https://yesterweb.org/#appendix-i Yesterweb community manifestos]
* 2014-11-04: [https://userdatamanifesto.org/2.0/ User Data Manifesto 2.0] - Defining basic rights for people to control their own data in the internet age.
* 2014-07-04: The [[ind.ie]] [https://ind.ie/manifesto/ manifesto] - a separate effort developed independently from the indiewebcamp community (i.e. no discussion of its creation on #indiewebcamp [[IRC]], nor on this wiki).
* 2001-05-17: The [http://independentsday.org/x_phase/one/manifesto.php Independents Day Manifesto] - some original inspiration that planted some of the seeds of the IndieWeb movement.

** "Arguably, the most important blog post I ever wrote. A sort of personal manifesto on my site.After I stopped promoting myself as if I were a brand, I needed to put my foot down and declare what I stand for, on the only place that's not going away: my personal website.So, here it is. A personal manifesto, where I touch on these topics: https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/personal-manifesto/#MentalHealth <br>#Sustainability <br>#Technology <br>#SmallWeb <br>#IndieWeb <br>#SocialMedia" [https://sonomu.club/@m2m @m2m] June 22, 2023
