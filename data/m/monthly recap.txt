'''<dfn>monthly recap</dfn>''' is a post that summarizes your posts from the previous (typically Gregorian) month, that some [[silos]] like [[Swarm]] automatically generate for you and allow you to cross-post to other silos.

The key aspect of a monthly recap is the recap, which distinguishes it from monthly [[archives]], though a monthly archive could provide a recap at the top as a summary.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Jonathan LaCour ===
{{cleverdevil}} has automatic monthly recaps on separate pages [https://chat.indieweb.org/2019-01-03#t1546541759062500 since 2019-01-03], e.g.:
* https://cleverdevil.io/summary/2018/11
* https://cleverdevil.io/summary/2018/7

Summaries can be accessed by clicking on a month in the [https://cleverdevil.io/archive archive page].

[https://github.com/cleverdevil/CleverCustomize Plugin for the Known CMS containing the archive/summary code].

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} has automatic monthly recaps on separate pages. A couple of examples are:
* [https://eddiehinkle.com/2019/01/ January 2019]
* [https://eddiehinkle.com/2017/06/ June 2017]

Right now nothing specifically links to the summaries, but they can be access when a user removes the post day, index and post type from a post's permalink. (A post has the permalink of https://eddiehinkle.com/2017/06/30/1/article/ so if you remove 30/1/article, you reach the month summary that contains that post). I also had [[day summary]] and [[year summary]] pages available at the same url structure.

One thing to note is that the map of checkins is actually just a png image, so it is marked up with a u-photo. An eventual text-based summary will be created so someone could follow my monthly recaps rather than my individual posts.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Swarm ===
[[Swarm]] automatically generates a monthly recap and notifies you when it's ready.

[[notification|Notification]] when it's ready (apparently 2 days after the month), on lock screen, and in notifications list in app:

== Brainstorming ==
* show a map with all of the locations (all [[checkin]]s, or all posts with [[location]] for that month)
* most liked photo (or top 3?) of that month
* most responded to post (or top 3) of that month (e.g. [[article]] with the most [[comments]])
