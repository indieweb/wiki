{{stub}}
'''<dfn>monthly recap</dfn>''' is a post that summarizes your posts from the previous (typically Gregorian) month, that some [[silos]] like [[Swarm]] automatically generate for you and allow you to cross-post to other silos.

The key aspect of a monthly recap is the recap, which distinguishes it from monthly [[archives]], though a monthly archive could provide a recap at the top as a summary.
