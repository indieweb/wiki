'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page microformats]</dfn>''' are extensions to [[HTML]] for marking up [[people]], organizations, [[event|events]], [[locations]], [[article|blog posts]], products, [[review|reviews]], [[resumé|resumés]], [[recipe|recipes]] etc. Sites use microformats to publish a standard API that is consumed and used by search engines, aggregators, and other tools.

[http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2 microformats2] (aka mf2) is the latest stable and interoperable version of [[microformats]]. Most [[tools#Other_Tools|parsers and tools]] should support backwards compatibility for prior versions of microformats.


== Why ==
You should publish the microformats that themselves have reasons why to use that resonate with you, e.g.:
* [[h-card#Why|Why h-card]]
** [[in-reply-to#Why|Why in-reply-to]]
* [[h-entry#Why|Why h-entry]]
* [[XFN#Why|Why XFN]]
__TOC__

== IndieWeb Use ==
The IndieWeb makes heavy use of:

* [[h-card]] to mark up profiles and authors in published posts, then consumed by code (e.g. [[reply-context]]s, [[reader]]s) for [[authorship]] and more.
* [[h-entry]] to markup [[posts]], [[replies]], etc., then consumed by code for displaying, summarizing, replying.
* [[in-reply-to]] to markup links from [[replies]] to original posts, then consumed by code for [[displaying comments]], comment threads, etc.
* [[XFN]] for relationships, and identity consolidation (rel=me), consumed by code for [[IndieAuth]] etc.

== Implementations ==

There is a [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2#Parsers fuller list of implementations] on the microformats wiki. Here are some used by the indieweb community:

* [http://indiewebify.me/ indiewebify me] - a step by step markup guide and validator
* [http://unmung.com unmung] - a feed to mf2 transalator, and an mf2 parser based on [[mf2py]]
* [http://pin13.net/mf2/ pin13.net] - Aaron's PHP-based parser.

=== Are microformats an API ===
Q: Are microformats an API?

A: No, microformats are more like the information returned from an API.

HTTP GET of a particular URL of a website can be an API. microformats in the resulting HTML  provide the information you might otherwise get from a bespoke API.

Thus combining HTTP, good site URL design, and microformats, your site can be your API. No separate XML/RDF/JSON/??? API endpoints needed. At least for readonly. For a write "API", see [[micropub]].

A: Actually, yes, microformats are the simplest way of providing a read-only API, also known as "your website is your API".


=== Why not APIs ===
{{main|API}}
Q: Why not APIs instead of microformats?

A: See [[API]], in short:
# secondary URLs
# secondary formats
# API key
# TOS requirements
# Unique snowflakes
# Complexity
# Fragility
