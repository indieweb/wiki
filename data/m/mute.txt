{{stub}}

'''<dfn>mute</dfn>''' is the ability to hide [[posts]] in your [[reader]] that have specific words, or from particular publishers, optionally with an automatic expiration, after which newer posts are visible again.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None currently.

== Silo Examples ==
[[silos]] that have a "mute" feature for hiding posts from people so you don't have to see what they post, without having to unfollow them.

Some silos also have the ability to mute whole words or phrases, independent of publisher, with an optional expiration, after which you start seeing new posts with those words again.

=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] - added in 2007?
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] lets a user remove content from their news feed in several ways, all accessible right from a singular post:

# '''Hide post'''. This allows the user to permanently hide a specific [[post]].
# '''Snooze <i>Author</i> for 30 days'''. This allows the user to temporarily hide posts from a specific [[author]].
# '''Hide all from <i>Author</i>'''. This allows the user to permanently hide posts from an author the user isn’t [[following]] themselves. The post was put on their timeline by the [[Facebook Algorithm]] because a [[friend]] interacted with it or [[share|shared]] it.
# '''Unfollow <i>Author</i>'''. This allows the user to permanently hide posts from an author the user is following. This isn’t “hiding” or “muting” so much as actively unfollowing a feed the user themself previously choose to follow.

Some form of muting has reportedly been available since 2010(?).
