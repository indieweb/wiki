=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] lets a user remove content from their news feed in several ways, all accessible right from a singular post:

# '''Hide post'''. This allows the user to permanently hide a specific [[post]].
# '''Snooze <i>Author</i> for 30 days'''. This allows the user to temporarily hide posts from a specific [[author]].
# '''Hide all from <i>Author</i>'''. This allows the user to permanently hide posts from an author the user isn’t [[following]] themselves. The post was put on their timeline by the [[Facebook Algorithm]] because a [[friend]] interacted with it or [[share|shared]] it.
# '''Unfollow <i>Author</i>'''. This allows the user to permanently hide posts from an author the user is following. This isn’t “hiding” or “muting” so much as actively unfollowing a feed the user themself previously choose to follow.

Some form of muting has reportedly been available since 2010(?).
