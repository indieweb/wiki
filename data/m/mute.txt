{{stub}}

'''<dfn>mute</dfn>''' is the ability to hide [[posts]] in your [[reader]] that have specific words, or from particular publishers, sometimes only a specific type or format, optionally with an automatic expiration, after which newer posts are visible again.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None currently.

== Silo Examples ==
Some [[silos]] have a "mute" feature for hiding posts from people so you don't have to see what they post, without having to unfollow them.
* Some let you mute some types of posts (reposts, e.g. Twitter retweets) per person
* Some let you mute ephemeral vs normal posts (Instagram [[story|stories]], posts, or both) per person.

Some silos also have the ability to mute whole words or phrases, independent of publisher, with an optional expiration, after which you start seeing new posts with those words again.

=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] - added in 2007? (needs citations, screenshots)

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] lets a user remove content from their news feed in several ways, all accessible right from a singular post:

[[File:facebook-post-actions.png|right]]

# '''Hide post'''. This allows the user to permanently hide a specific [[post]].
# '''Snooze <i>Author</i> for 30 days'''. This allows the user to temporarily hide posts from a specific [[author]].
# '''Hide all from <i>Author</i>'''. This allows the user to permanently hide posts from an author the user isn’t [[following]] themselves. The post was put on their timeline by the [[Facebook Algorithm]] because a [[friend]] interacted with it or [[share|shared]] it.
# '''Unfollow <i>Author</i>'''. This allows the user to permanently hide posts from an author the user is following. This isn’t “hiding” or “muting” so much as actively unfollowing a feed the user themself previously choose to follow.

Some form of muting has reportedly been available since 2010(?).

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] - added in 2014 [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171399 more info]

* Mute Tweets that contain particular words, phrases, usernames, emojis, or hashtags [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175032 more info]
* Mute a conversation [https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options more info]
* Mute retweets per account: has an option to “not show retweets” from someone you follow (needs screenshot), which you can enable/disable using the "..." button/menu from their profile page. This is essentially a “mute retweets” feature even though they don’t call it that.

=== Instagram ===
On the iOS app when viewing someone’s profile that you’re following, you can:
* tap on the [ Following  v ] button 
* it reveals a slide up menu from the bottom of the screen which has a "Mute    >" item, 
* tapping "Mute" slides left a submenu of "Posts" and "Stories", 
* each item has a toggle switch to its right, which you can set independently.

=== Strava ===
On the iOS app when viewing someone’s profile that you’re following, you can:
* tap on the [ Following  v ] button 
* it reveals a slide up menu from the bottom of the screen which has a "Mute    ( )" item with radio button and explanatory text:
** "Hide their activities and posts from your feed. Strava won’t let them know they’re muted."
* tapping the item toggles the radio button; checked (white check on a filled in orange background) means you won’t see their activities/posts on your home "Following" feed

== Past Examples ==
=== Quiet Time ===
[https://github.com/kylewm/quiettime Quiet Time] by {{kylewm}} was a an open source tool and service for temporarily muting someone on Twitter. It lived at quiettime.xyz.

=== Flaminga ===
[https://web.archive.org/web/20140401235401/http://madebycori.com/flaminga/ Flaminga] was (site went down ~2014-12) an in-development Twitter client that proposed some elegant solutions to spam and abuse on Twitter.

* Shared mute lists. Subscribe to a friend's mute list
* Mute tweets from a muted user's followers
* Mute tweets that mention you along with a muted third party 
* Mute brand new users (configurable 1 day to 1 year)
* Mute users who post too many repeated links, or who are muted by others

== Brainstorming ==
=== Alternative to multiple feeds ===
Mute seems like a much more user-friendly way to provide control to readers of sites over what kinds of content they see from that site in their [[reader]]s, as compared to having to either choose from or change their minds about which [[feed]]s of a site to follow / subscribe to.

Use-case: you want to subscribe to / follow someone’s personal site updates, but there’s either too much there (they post too often), or you’re uninterested in some of their updates in particular, and want a way to only get the updates you want.
