'''<dfn>mood</dfn>''' is sometimes expressed explicitly in or about a [[post]], by the post [[author]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Ashton McAllan ===
{{acegiak}} has a basic implementation on acegiak.net which can display a mood name and a percentile mood value but currently lacks a smooth ui for entering mood value. She is developing the [https://github.com/acegiak/moodkind Moodkind] wordpress plugin to add this mood tracking functionality to the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] for wordpress.
Example post:
* https://acegiak.net/2016/03/18/feeling-productive/

=== Aaron Parecki ===
At [[2019/Austin|IndieWebCamp Austin 2019]], {{aaronpk}} added [[photo]]/[[emoji]] support to his website to add some mood/sentiment-based analysis to his posts. By adding specific emoji to his post, he can change the image in his [[h-card]] to provide a more context-based photo for each post he makes.

=== Ana Rodrigues ===

{{ana-r}} has a small and manual implementation of showing: "Mood, thinking, doing, listening" at the end of blog posts. Currently these are set manually in the frontmatter of posts.

* Example post: https://ohhelloana.blog/mood-doing-thinking-listening/

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Facebook]] - "... feeling ..."
* [[LiveJournal]] - different [[icons]]/avatars per post to express mood
* [https://jawbone.com/up/developer/endpoints/mood Jawbone Up] - 8 icons from slumped to excited that you drag between to set your mood
<blockquote>Mood type. 1 = Amazing, 2 = Pumped UP, 3 = Energized, 8= Good, 4 = Meh, 5 = Dragging, 6 = Exhausted, 7 = Totally Done. NOTE: mood number 8 is out of sequence</blockquote>

==== Gyroscope ====
[https://gyrosco.pe/ Gyroscope] offers two ways to log moods in their Pro version of their app. Unlike normal mood logging rather than choosing a single mood from a list, they put the emotions on cards and have you swipe right or left if you are feeling it. Then it combines your selected emotions to give you a picture of your overall mood. (need screenshot examples)

* the first is called Impatient mode. If claims it takes less than 10 seconds and has the following mood options listed to select from with emojis: Happy, Sad, Annoyed, Friendly, Healthy, Miserable, Nervous, Strong, Productive, Afraid, Angry.

It presents the following options: Peaceful, Miserable, Confused, Annoyed, Inspired, Romantic, Loving, Strong, Healthy, Hostile, Caffiennated, Tense, Amused, Sleepy, Afraid, Exhausted, Social, Adventurous, Celebrating, Appreciated, Cheerful, Lonely, Friendly, Happy, Sad, Carefree, Nervous, Sage, Dissapointed, Discouraged, Energized, Tired, Late, Hungry, Drunk, Productive, Fashionable, Sick, Angry
