== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Ashton McAllan ===
{{acegiak}} has a basic implementation on acegiak.net which can display a mood name and a percentile mood value but currently lacks a smooth ui for entering mood value. She is developing the [https://github.com/acegiak/moodkind Moodkind] wordpress plugin to add this mood tracking functionality to the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] for wordpress.
Example post:

* [[LiveJournal]] - different [[icons]]/avatars per post to express mood
