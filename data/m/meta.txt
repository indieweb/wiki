'''<dfn>meta tags</dfn>''' are lines of code that describe information about a page such as its title, how social networks should render an embedded snippet of the page, and where a browser can find links to other resources needed to load a page.

== Use Cases ==

There are meta tags for a range of use cases, including:

* Defining how sites that want to embed a link to your site (i.e. Slack or Twitter) should do so.
* Telling a browser where to find the fonts, JavaScript, and CSS necessary to render a page.
* Adding a license for a page.
* Linking to the author of a page via rel=me.
* Defining icons for mobile devices to use if someone adds your site to their home screen.
* Telling search engines whether they can and how they should crawl your website.
* Specifying alternate feeds for a page such as an [[RSS]], [[Atom]], or [[JSON Feed]].
* and more...

== Meta Tags in the IndieWeb Community ==

The following IndieWeb specifications make use of meta tags in some way:

* [[IndieAuth]], to specify an authorization and a token endpoint.
* [[Webmention]], to specify a webmention endpoint.
* [[Micropub]], to specify the endpoint of your Micropub server.
* [[Microsub]], to specify where a tool can find your Microsub server.
* [[WebSub]], to inform hubs where they should go to subscribe to your content.
