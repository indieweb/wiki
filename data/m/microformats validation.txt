'''<dfn>microformats validation</dfn>''' is the process of inspecting a JSON document that purports to contain microformats2 JSON to see if it complies with the specification for the format, and potentially with the known vocabularies... 

{{cleverdevil}} is working on an attempt to make this easier [https://github.com/cleverdevil/microformats2 https://github.com/cleverdevil/microformats2 ] using [[JSON Schema]].

* {{martijnvdven}} has a [[JSON Schema]] for a JSON [[microformats2]] object [https://gist.github.com/Zegnat/65ed9a9fb0546fb8c4aa0c0b790b8a40 available as a Gist].
