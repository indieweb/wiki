'''<dfn>Maps</dfn>''' are representations of the real world that are often used to display the [[location]] of a post, especially for [[checkin]]s, and sometimes an aspect of [[archive]] pages, showing locations (or animating [[travel]]) during the month or other time period. There are many services that can be used to put a map on your site, like [[OpenStreetMap]] and [[Google Maps]]. 

The term '''map''' is also used for other representations of relationships between things. See e.g. [[indiemap]], [[social_web_map]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(this section needs expansion with headings for people, and links + images of specific examples!)

There are several IndieWeb sites that display and show interesting things with maps!

* {{adactio}} has a map of his travels
* {{gwg}} has a map view of his [[archives]] showing where he posted from
* {{jgmac1106}} uses a gpx file, an owncloud app, and an iframe to embed maps on their website
** [https://jgregorymcverry.com/myrunningtrail|My Running Trail].
* Max Dietrich uses Leaflet to display routes of [https://mxd.codes/activities activities] with OpenStreetMap.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Abstract US maps for data ===
Why:
* '''Privacy / blurring.''' Abstract maps allow a coarser presentation of data that may be more suitable for publishing publicly, instead of cartesian maps that provide precise location data.
* '''Simpler display, focus on non-geo data.''' When the data to display is more important than precise geographical relationships among the data, an abstract map helps by removing the "noise" of extraneous geographical details which would otherwise distract from the data being presented. Abstract subway maps are another example of this.

Use-cases:
* Coarse geographic "heatmaps" of your checkins per state
* Coarse geographic posts [[archive]]
