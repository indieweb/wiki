'''<dfn>Maps</dfn>''' are representations of the real world. There are many services that can be used to put a map on your site, like [[OpenStreetMap]] and [[Google Maps]]. Commonly used to display the [[location]] of a post, especially for [[checkin]]s.

The term '''map''' is also used for other representations of relationships between things. See e.g. [[indiemap]], [[social_web_map]].
