'''<dfn>[https://github.com/dshanske/mf2_s mf2_s]</dfn>''' is a starter [[WordPress]] theme from {{gwg}} which supports [[microformats]]. 

It is a fork of the popular [https://underscores.me Underscores] starter theme which is primarily meant for developers to use as a base for building custom themes. It is under active development with the hopes it will form the basis of future themes. Because it is a "starter theme" meant for developers, average users will likely find that it doesn't meet their needs without changing it significantly.
