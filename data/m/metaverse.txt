The '''<dfn>metaverse</dfn>''' is a concept of a virtual 3D world introduced in Neal Stephenson‚Äôs ‚ÄúSnow Crash‚Äù book, later adopted by the Second Life startup/service, and recently an area of interest on the web, and a topic of discussion at the [https://events.indieweb.org/2021/10/indieweb-create-day-ZKw5v2nFDu6f 2021-10-09 IndieWeb Create Day].

Early implementations on the internet so far (as of 2021) are either silos (e.g. Second Live, Roblox, Fortnite) or attempt to create scarcity in some other fashion (e.g. Decentraland). An "Indie" metaverse would instead be built like the web: anybody can set up their own space, and link it with other people's spaces, without a central entity or other form of scarcity.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Website equivalent of VR ===
{{schmarty}}: a VR equivalent of a website could be a virtual space/scene, or several such spaces/scenes connected by portals, all under your control. webmention and microformats are just plumbing. webmention in particular could be used to create connections or responses between spaces.

** "Since there seems to be growing confusion on this: I have nothing to do with anything that FB is up to involving the Metaverse, other than the obvious fact that they're using a term I coined in Snow Crash. There has been zero communication between me and FB & no biz relationship." [http://nealstephenson.com/ @nealstephenson] October 29, 2021
