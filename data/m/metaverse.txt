The '''<dfn>metaverse</dfn>''' is a concept of a virtual 3D world introduced in Neal Stephenson’s “Snow Crash” book, later adopted by the Second Life startup/service, and recently an area of interest on the web, and a topic of discussion at the [https://events.indieweb.org/2021/10/indieweb-create-day-ZKw5v2nFDu6f 2021-10-09 IndieWeb Create Day].

Early implementations on the internet so far (as of 2021) are either silos (e.g. Second Live, Roblox, Fortnite) or attempt to create scarcity in some other fashion (e.g. Decentraland). An "Indie" metaverse would instead be built like the web: anybody can set up their own space, and link it with other people's spaces, without a central entity or other form of scarcity.
