{{stub}}

'''<dfn>modularity</dfn>''' is one of the IndieWeb [[principles]], sometimes expressed as “Build platform agnostic platforms”, that advocates designing and building modular code and services composed of pieces that can be swapped to reduce dependencies on a particular device, language, API, storage model, or platform.

Modularity increases the chance that at least ''some'' of it can and will be re-used, improved, which you can then reincorporate. AKA [[building-blocks]]. AKA "small pieces loosely joined".
