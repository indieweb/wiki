'''<dfn>multi-factor authentication</dfn>''' (commonly <dfn>two-factor authentication</dfn>, abbreviated <dfn>2FA</dfn> or <dfn>TFA</dfn>) is an authentication process that requires at least a second component to a standard authentication method. Typically the second component is something user possesses, like a [[TOTP]] application or a hardware key (often USB).
