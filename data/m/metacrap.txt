** "When you add content that's not visual, like `aria-label`, always be asking: how will this be maintained?<br><br>I increasingly see sites with non-sensical `aria-label` attributes, because the context changed, but the attribute was not updated." [http://hidde.blog @hdv] August 6, 2020

* Wikipedia used to have an article on metacrap, which has subsequently been changed into a barely applicable redirect. See https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metacrap&oldid=830562352 for the latest actual Wikipedia metacrap article content, and consider if the issues noted there can be resolved with citations.
