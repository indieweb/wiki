'''<dfn>Multi-site Indieweb</dfn>''' is a hybrid approach to Indieweb in which a wide range of people have two (or more) indieweb enabled platforms for a multitude of reasons.


== Brainstorming ==
* Surely there's a better nomenclature for this concept and it will surely grow as generation 2+ join the movement and begin experimenting. What are other (better?) potential names for this idea?
* Is it a good/bad idea? What are the pros/cons?

== Reasoning ==
People may have one or more reasons for using multiple IndieWeb enabled platforms in tandem, some of which may or may not include:
* Dogfooding one project (usually evolving), while simultaneously enjoying the immediate benefits of other (potentially more robust projects) while also testing out alternate UX/UI configurations.
* Having a broader array of posting options and functionalities, while still owning their content
* Personal implementation of some features can be daunting (particularly for [[Generations]] 2+) and the overriding value of the IndieWeb philosophy has them doing what they can to be a part of the movement
* They got carried away with [https://indieweb.org/own_all_the_things owning all the things]
* They highlight different parts of their online identity through their different sites. Examples: 
** One site highlights their personal life, another one highlights their professional one, and another for their very obscure hobby etc.
* there are people who run [https://indieweb.org/static_site_generator static site generators] and don't need a complete rebuild of their website for a single note posting.

== Indieweb Examples ==
=== Kevin Marks ===
{{kevinmarks}} has both [http://kevinmarks.com kevinmarks.com] and a [http://known.kevinmarks.com/ Known site]

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} uses [[WordPress]] on his [http://www.boffosocko.com primary site], but utilizes [[Known]] for shorter form content, particularly for status updates and mobile workflows on a [http://stream.boffosocko.com secondary site]. The WordPress site was one of his first and was primarily longer form content. While it was relatively indieweb-able with plugins, in the early days Known provided a lot more bug-free indieweb experience, particularly for syndicating short form content out to a variety of social silos. With some additional [http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/18/rss-feeds-a-follow-up-on-my-indieweb-commitment-2017/ recent development] on his WordPress site for better separation of content and additional methods of subscription so that readers/followers weren't inundated with content they might not necessarily want to read, more content is being generated from WordPress, but he still prefers to use Known in particular for short form replies which send better formed webmentions due to some quirks in his WordPress theme and associated plugins.

=== Jeremy Cherfas ===
{{jeremycherfas}} has multiple sites with various levels of [[IndieMark]] on various platforms. He's a self-professed member of Generation 2 or possibly 3. At the moment I have project-specific sites running under WordPress ([http://www.fornacalia.com fornacalia] for bread making, [http://eatthispodcast.com Eat This Podcast] for podcasting, and the [http://agro.biodiver.se Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog], a kind of news-aggregator where a colleague now provides most of the content and I manage the site). None of the WP websites is currently IndieWeb enabled. Two of the sites have Twitter users as well. All this is historical and predates me learning about IndieWeb, and [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/putting-my-house-in-order-phase-1 I am still not sure how best to integrate everything], or even whether that would be worthwhile.

=== Scott Kingery ===
Scott Kingery primarily uses [[WordPress]] but in February 2017 [https://twitter.com/TechLifeWeb/status/828744978188922880 began toying] with [[Known]].

=== Pelle Wessman  ===
{{voxpelli}} has both [https://voxpelli.com/ voxpelli.com] and [https://kodfabrik.se/ kodfabrik.se], both static pages. The first one is newer and the home of his personal blog. The later one is older and home to his freelance/professional profile and, for legacy reasons, his e-mail and his online identity.

=== Martijn van der Ven  ===
{{martijnvdven}} separates his blog on [https://licit.li/ licit.li] from his online identity on [https://vanderven.se/martijn/ vanderven.se/martijn/]. The latter has expressed his identity for over 10 years and that will never been taken over by a blog or other type of website.

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [https://aaronparecki.com aaronparecki.com] as his primary site, but also has [https://w7apk.com w7apk.com] for his ham radio projects, and [https://percolator.today percolator.today] for his [[microcast]].

=== Aaron Davis ===
{{mrkrndvs}} uses [https://readwriterespond.com Read Write Respond] as a place to record longer posts and reflections, [https://collect.readwriterespond.com Read Write Collect] to collect together disparate parts of the web in the one place and [https://wikity.readwriterespond.com Read Write Wikity] to organically grow ideas.

=== Patrick Rhone ===
<blockquote>Some may ask, why two websites? I’ve had a lot of time to think about what I felt my approach to a blog would be given what I know and love about social media and how a blog that combined the short form, link sharing, and longer form may look like. It was easier for me to start that fresh than trying to redesign/relaunch my existing website to accommodate that. Sometimes, it’s easier to build a new house than to rehab an old one. I also had some time to think about the original intent of the TLD. Commercial = .com, Organization = .org, Network = .net. So, my other website is for commercial purposes. This one is to build a network.</blockquote> -via http://www.patrickrhone.net/site-notes/
