'''<dfn>math</dfn>''' is hard, for real, for most people beyond arithmetic, like not understanding relative sizes of fractions ([https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76144/why-no-one-wanted-aws-third-pound-burger thinking ⅓ is less than ¼]), so when [[blogging]] or writing [[microcopy]], keep any use of math relatively simple if possible, especially in any [[UI]]s that you create for others.
