'''<dfn>math</dfn>''' is hard, for real, for most people beyond whole number arithmetic, like not understanding relative sizes of fractions ([https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76144/why-no-one-wanted-aws-third-pound-burger thinking ⅓ is less than ¼]) or mistakes when calculating minutes &amp; days durations across hours or months, so when [[blogging]], writing [[microcopy]], or designing a [[user interface]], keep any use of math relatively simple and instead directly present visually clear durations and relative sizes.
