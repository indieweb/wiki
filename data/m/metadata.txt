<dfn>Metadata</dfn>, specifically "descriptive metadata",  is an umbrella term for all the different ways data (content) can be marked up or organized to facilitate machine-readability. In the context of the IndieWeb, personal sites use metadata to locate interesting information in each other's HTML markup (e.g., author name, post title, etc.).

* This page/content should be moved somewhere with less confusing framing
<blockquote>
tantek: danlyke, kylewm I think the framing of "metadata" leads people down a
         confusing and unhelpful path.

== Discussion ==

<blockquote>
<p>
kylewm: is there any sort of comparison that explains the relationship
between mf, microdata, schema.org, AS1/2, JSON-LD, RDFa, turtle, n3,
etc.? I have a lot of trouble understanding e.g., which things are
syntax and which are vocabularies and which are the same or successors to each other  [09:36]
</p><p>
tommorris: kylewm: schema.org is a vocabulary. microformats used to be
syntax+vocab, now those have been separated in mf2. JSON-LD is a
layer of RDFing translation on top of JSON (think of it like an
'RDF stylesheet'!)
</p><p>
tommorris: kylewm: Notation3 is an RDF syntax that's human readable. RDFa is
RDF in HTML.
</p><p>
tommorris: kylewm: microdata is Hixie's reimplementation of RDFa's use cases
but without RDFa's RDFisms.
</p><p>
tommorris: kylewm: turtle and N3 are so similar you can just treat them as
one. there are a few minor differences but just treat N3 as a
superset of Turtle
</p><p>
tommorris: kylewm: ActivityStreams 1 is based on Atom. AS2 is based on JSON
(and/or JSON-LD and/or a few other things to be determined)
