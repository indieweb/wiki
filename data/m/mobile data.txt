This page about '''mobile data providers''' that outlines alternative methods of getting on the web that meet the following criteria:

* Does not require a physical wired connection
* Does not require phone & sms plans to have data plans
* Allows user to be mobile with data

=== Verizon MiFi ===

* {{beesbuzz.biz}}: I received a free access point and a month of service from a Google I/O promotion back in 2011. Bandwidth was decent where there was coverage; there were a surprising number of gaps in San Francisco (where I lived at the time). Renewing the plan beyond the promotional period would have been way too expensive for the utility I was getting out of it. I still have the access point around here somewhere.

=== Freedom Pop ===

Freedom Pop is a discount mobile provider which offers "freemium" mobile plans. {{beesbuzz.biz}} has been an occasional user in the past, while attempting to use this to get away from traditional phone service. General findings:

* The billing is purposefully confusing, and "free" isn't really free; for unused accounts they sneak random small charges onto peoples' credit cards with various nonsensical explanations for why it's "required"
* Coverage is spotty at best, and even in major metro areas it experiences frequent dropouts and low availability
* The available devices are always a few generations behind, and the hardware appears to be poorly-refurbished returns to discount cellular providers
* If a device is unused for too long it will be shut off, and getting it reactivated is an onerous process
