A '''<dfn>microblog</dfn>''' is a short post that may be published in a [[silo]] or on a person's own site, in which case it is often [[syndicated]] to a [[silo]].

A microblog is also a collection of microblog posts, mirroring the confusion between blog and blog post

In the original [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing Kickstarter pitch]  for what became [[micro.blog]], Manton Reese, who built Micro.blog, used the more generic term microblog. He said: 

"Microblog posts are _short_ with [inline links](http://snippets.today) and styles like a long post. But you can publish them both to your own site and a social network."

The [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/microblog Cambridge Dictionary] defines microblog as:

"a blog in the form of a short message for anyone to read, sent especially from a mobile phone:|

"''Microblogs, for example on Twitter, can be for anything from "what I'm doing now" to coverage of serious political events.''"

While it disclaims responsibility for the examples it offers, the Cambridge Dictionary makes it clear that "microblog" is a generic form of expression, while Micro.blog is one specific application, among others, that permits people to microblog.

Micro.blog thus bears the same relationship to microblog as Kleenex does to facial tissue, Hoover to vacuum cleaner and Bic to ballpoint pen.
