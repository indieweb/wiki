<span class="p-summary">An IndieWeb '''<dfn>mascot</dfn>''' could offer a visual representation of the community, and create [[fun]] & welcoming visual explanations; a mushroom (<dfn>üçÑ</dfn>) has been proposed for the IndieWeb mascot.</span>

{{tracydurnell}} drew up some initial [https://tracydurnell.com/2021/10/09/indieweb-create-day-mushroom-mascot-illustrated/ mushroom mascot illustrations] at IndieWeb Create Day 2021-10-09 (Open to suggestions and ideas of activities for a mushroom to do!), which had a positive reception by participants. There was also a suggestion to consider dropping a mushroom emoji üçÑ into social media profiles to indicate IndieWeb presence, solidarity, support.

Previously, at the [https://etherpad.indieweb.org/hwc-2021-04-21 2021-04-21 Homebrew Website Club - Americas], there was some discussion of the value of a mascot for the Indie Web. Documenting and continuing to add thoughts here. Please vote for your preference, and/or add thoughts and comments! -- {{tracydurnell}} 2021-05-05 

== Brand Notes == 
* the IndieWeb represents multiple different elements at once: the community using the Indie Web, the tools that provide the infrastructure for the Indie Web, and the [[principles|philosophy]] of the Indie Web
* visually, an Indie Web Camp [[logo]] already exists, featuring warm colors and geometric elements

== Mascot Ideas ==
At the [https://etherpad.indieweb.org/hwc-2021-04-21 2021-04-21 Homebrew Website Club - Americas], mushrooms and bees rose to the top as preferred mascot options. 

=== Mushrooms ===
Metaphorically: 
* mushrooms and mycelium are apt for the connective nature of the Indie Web - mycelium form vast networks under the forest floor, and although only the mushrooms are visible, the fungus organism spreads much farther and is vital ecologically

==== Benefits ====
* mushrooms have a great diversity in appearance, which complements the [[plurality]] principle and is anti-[[monoculture]]
* mushrooms are fruiting bodies, e.g. the fruits of our labors

Visually: 
* mushrooms can be cute! 
* mushrooms come in many shapes for visual variety
* mushrooms come in many colors, including red, orange, and yellow, to complement the existing Indie Web Camp [[logo]]
* üçÑ has an emoji

==== Considerations ====
* avoid drug and phallic associations in design

==== Mushroom emoji meanings ====
From a handful of references:
* https://emojis.wiki/mushroom/
* https://hotemoji.com/mushroom-emoji.html
* http://hyemoji.com/Mushroom

A few meanings that seem positive or relatively harmless, in order of frequency/prominence in references:
* exciting, regain energy, e.g. power up mushroom in the Super Mario Bros (regain power over your online identity & data)
* psychedelic, something for the imagination, feel like a bit out of your mind (perhaps an encouragement to imagine & see things differently than the world of [[silos]])
* nature, together with üå≤ Evergreen Tree or üçÄ clover emoji to illustrate the forest (towards a sustainable web community)
* autumn/fall season, used with üçÇüçÅ fall leaves
* dark, damp places

Unfortunate possible meanings:
* something poisonous

=== Bees ===
==== Benefits ====
Metaphorically: 
* honeybees work together to build something bigger - lots of individuals pitching in
* connects with the metaphor of a [[digital garden]]
** bees are essential to a thriving ecosystem
* honeycomb could visually represent [[building blocks]]
* honey [[longevity|lasts forever]] and is also [[eat_what_you_cook|delicious]] ;) 

Visually:
* bees can be cute!
* honeybees are yellow and black, and can be visually represented with stylized shapes, to complement the style of the existing Indie Web Camp [[logo]]
* could also use hexagon shape of honeycomb to continue geometric theme
* Also has an emoji üêù

==== Considerations ====
* bee mascots and logos may be relatively common (e.g. Swarm)
* it should be a friendly bee, not a threatening wasp

=== Other Mascot Ideas ===
* [[Loqi]] - dinosaur - Loqi is not unique to the Indie Web however
* cats - Very Internet and also cute
** Cats are curious, an attribute present in the community
** Cats like to explore, just as many of our community members love to explore the net to find new websites
** Cats are whimsical (expressing the "have fun!" principle)
* hermit crabs and turtles - carry their home around on their backs
* A leaf?

* earlier similar conceptual metaphor of web/internet growth as "fungal": https://twitter.com/Caterina/status/4852023167
** "@kevinmarks @plasticbaguk Things on the internet grow fungally, not virally. The metaphor is completely wrong." [http://www.caterina.net @Caterina] October 14, 2009
