<span class="p-summary">An IndieWeb '''<dfn>mascot</dfn>''' could offer a visual representation of the community & philosophy to create welcoming visual explanations for those new to the IndieWeb.</span> Also, mascots can be [[fun]].

At the [https://etherpad.indieweb.org/hwc-2021-04-21 2021-04-21 Homebrew Website Club - Americas], there was some discussion of the value of a mascot for the Indie Web. Documenting and continuing to add thoughts here. Please vote for your preference, and/or add thoughts and comments! -- {{tracydurnell}} 2021-05-05 

== Brand Notes == 
* the IndieWeb represents multiple different elements at once: the community using the Indie Web, the tools that provide the infrastructure for the Indie Web, and the [[principles|philosophy]] of the Indie Web
* visually, an Indie Web Camp [[logo]] already exists, featuring warm colors and geometric elements

== Mascot Ideas ==


=== Mushrooms ===
==== Benefits ====
Metaphorically: 
* mushrooms and mycelium are apt for the connective nature of the Indie Web - mycelium form vast networks under the forest floor, and although only the mushrooms are visible, the fungus organism spreads much farther and is vital ecologically
* mushrooms have a great diversity in appearance, which complements both the [[plurality]] principle and 
* mushrooms are fruiting bodies, e.g. the fruits of our labors

Visually: 
* mushrooms can be cute! 
* mushrooms come in many shapes for visual variety
* mushrooms come in many colors, including red, orange, and yellow, to complement the existing Indie Web Camp [[logo]]
* üçÑ has an emoji

==== Considerations ====
* avoid drug and phallic associations in design

=== Bees ===
==== Benefits ====
Metaphorically: 
* honeybees work together to build something bigger - lots of individuals pitching in
* connects with the metaphor of a [[digital garden]]
* honeycomb could visually represent [[building blocks]]
* honey [[longevity|lasts forever]] and is also [[eat_what_you_cook|delicious]] ;) 

Visually:
* bees can be cute!
* honeybees are yellow and black, and can be visually represented with stylized shapes, to complement the style of the existing Indie Web Camp [[logo]]
* could also use hexagon shape of honeycomb to continue geometric theme 

==== Considerations ====
* bee mascots and logos may be relatively common (e.g. Swarm)
* it should be a friendly bee, not a threatening wasp
