{{stub}}
'''<dfn>midnight</dfn>''' is 00:00, roughly approximate (depending on [[timezone]]) to the middle of the night, when the sun is at its lowest point below the horizon. [[exercise|Exercise]] trackers often automatically end tracking activity for a day at midnight, and start a new day, and may break a walk that spans midnight into 2 days. (citation? [[Strava]] has no problems with this and does not break activities like that).
