'''<dfn>Media check-in</dfn>''' is a somewhat controversial concept that refers to a type of virtual check-in post, where the "location" is an item of consumable media such as a book, audio, video, or realtime media such as a radio or TV broadcast.

== Criticism ==
=== Dilutes the meaning of checkin ===
[[checkin]]s referred specifically to explicitly notifying your friends (sometimes followers) that you were at a <em>physical location, typically a [[venue]]</em>, as pioneered by [[Dodgeball]] and then [[Foursquare]] (and copied by [[Brightkite]], [[Gowalla]], [[Yelp]], [[Facebook]], and maybe others like [[Loopt]]).

The notion of a "media check-in" is completely artificial, has always felt like a forced concept / someting marketingy/brand-y/virtual to distract people from actual physical checkins. As such the use of the term "checkin" as referring to something virtual dilutes the meaning of the term.

=== Just a bookmark ===
Whether "checking into" a book, a page in a book, a movie, they are actually all just "[[bookmark]]s", especially in the example of "reading progress" mentioned above - which is a literal use of physical bookmarks.

There is no need for a different post type to express this concept.
