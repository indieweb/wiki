'''<dfn>Media check-in</dfn>''' is a somewhat controversial concept invented by [[silos]] that refers to a <em>virtual</em> check-in post, where the "location" is an item of consumable media such as a book, audio, video, or realtime stream like a radio or TV broadcast, and the check-in indicates your current attention rather than location.

== Why ==
A media check-in is one way to answer the question “What are you doing?”, a past silo writing prompt.

More recently, some media streaming services have implemented "<dfn>[[Wikipedia:Social viewing]]</dfn>" features (AKA <dfn>Watch Party</dfn> or <dfn>Group Watch</dfn>) which may provide a use-case for posting a “media check-in” on your own site, perhaps with whoever else happens to be watching the same show at the same time.

== Why not ==
Like a typical [[check-in]], a media check-in implies an active <em>current</em> presence.

Thus posts about having completed (even recently) consuming a piece of media are not really check-ins (perhaps they could be check-outs if you recently finished or left something).

Instead, if you want to capture having consumed an item of media, use the following posts:
* [[listen]] — when finished listening to a song, [[podcast]], or other audio item
* [[read]] - when having finished a book, or chapter there of, sometimes used for having starting reading a book as well
* [[watch]] - after viewing a film, movie, TV show etc.

== Criticism ==
=== Dilutes the meaning of checkin ===
[[checkin]]s referred specifically to explicitly notifying your friends (sometimes followers) that you were at a <em>physical location, typically a [[venue]]</em>, as pioneered by [[Dodgeball]] and then [[Foursquare]] (and copied by [[Brightkite]], [[Gowalla]], [[Yelp]], [[Facebook]], and maybe others like [[Loopt]]).

The notion of a "media check-in" is completely artificial, has always felt like a forced concept / someting marketingy/brand-y/virtual to distract people from actual physical checkins. As such the use of the term "checkin" as referring to something virtual dilutes the meaning of the term.

=== Just a bookmark ===
Whether "checking into" a book, a page in a book, a movie, they are actually all just "[[bookmark]]s", especially in the example of "reading progress" mentioned above - which is a literal use of physical bookmarks.

There is no need for a different post type to express this concept.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Before adding yourself here, check to see if your example is actually a post about a real-time current state, or if it is about something you have finished.

For posts about having consumed an item of media, instead see and add your example to e.g.:
* [[listen#IndieWeb_Example]]
* [[read#IndieWeb_Example]]
* [[watch#IndieWeb_Example]]

E.g. 
* <span id="gRegor_Morrill">gRegor Morrill</span>: See [[read#gRegor_Morrill|my example]] on the [[read]] page.
* <span id="benji">benji</span>: See [https://benji.dog/watched watched], [https://benji.dog/read read], [https://benji.dog/listens listens]

=== Add yourself! ===
If you have an actual real-time media check-in post, not just a completion of consuming a piece of media, then {{addyourself}}!
