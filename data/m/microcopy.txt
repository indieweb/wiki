{{stub}}

'''<dfn>microcopy</dfn>''' is small bits of text, a word, phrase, maybe a sentence, typically in a UI, designed to very quickly and simply communicate something about the UI without going into a lengthy glaze-over explanation. Due to its brevity, microcopy is often harder to write, and is considered a specific writing skill.
