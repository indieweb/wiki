{{stub}}

'''<dfn>microcopy</dfn>''' is small bits of text, a word, phrase, maybe a sentence, typically in a UI, designed to very quickly and simply communicate something about the UI without going into a lengthy glaze-over explanation or use obtuse terminology. Due to its brevity, microcopy is often harder to write, and is considered a specific writing skill.

== Good Examples ==
=== United Wifi ===
United Airlines has onboard wifi which sometimes encounters errors, in this case, the error message displayed provided a good general summary, followed with an apologetic description, and possible mitigations.

== Bad Examples ==
=== MacOS DVD Player ===
For what should be an amazingly simple task (playing DVDs), the [[Apple]] MacOS DVD Player app has some very bad microcopy in its error messages. e.g.

<blockquote>DVD Player encountered a system error <br/>Error: -69889</blockquote>
* Why is it claiming a passive victim role? "DVD Player '''encountered'''"
* Why is it blaming the mythical "system"? "'''system''' error"
* Why is it providing a completely meaningless error number? -69889
** perhaps only useful for a web search, which brings up an apple discussion thread:
*** https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1319259?start=0&tstart=0
** but still, is that a reasonable user expectation for error messages? something to enter into a Google Search etc. to then sleuth for on the web?
