    '''<dfn>manual until it hurts</dfn>''' is an indieweb principle of resisting automation until you have done it enough times to  really understand it,  and know that it is worth doing.

== Brainstorming ==

{{tantek}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-04-05#t1522946439115700 proposes this rough equation]: manual as long as the cost to doing so has a greater benefit than the reduced cost of doing it automatically minus the cost of setting up / maintaining automation.
