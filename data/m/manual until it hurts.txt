    '''<dfn>manual until it hurts</dfn>''' is an indieweb principle of resisting automation until you have done it enough times to  really understand it,  and know that it is worth doing.

== Brainstorming ==

{{tantek}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-04-05#t1522946439115700 proposes this rough equation]: manual as long as the cost to doing so has a greater benefit than the reduced cost of doing it automatically minus the cost of setting up / maintaining automation.

[https://www.arush.io/archives/author/amanda/ @Amanda Hi and thanks for stopping by. My name is Amanda Rush, and I'm building a homepage like it's 1999. I'm doing this for a number of reasons. First, I want to own all my content and have control over it, and to that end I am constantly updating this site so that it contains as much of my data as possible from any silo I may have an account on. I decided to start doing this when I finally got tired of all the curated timeline nonsense and the social media design element that encourages us to be horrible to each other online for clicks. I'm not saying you have to join me but of course I'd love it if you jumped ship and joined the indieweb with me. In the meantime, enjoy my content.] December 23, 2019
