'''<dfn>marketing</dfn>''' is , from a positive perspective, the work you can do to make it super easy for others (bloggers, journalists, etc) to write about your site, specific [[posts]], [[projects]], events, [[services]], and even products, by doing things like creating easy to re-use icons for yourself and your site, [[featured]] images for posts, copy pasteable links, logos, and short/medium/long descriptions of your things, and easy to find guides.
