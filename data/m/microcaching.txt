'''<dfn>microcaching</dfn>''' is a technique of caching web server responses for a very short period of time (seconds) to reduce the effects of the [[thundering herd]] problem, while also avoiding some of the pitfalls of correctly invalidating caches.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* This server has a 30-second microcache as of 2024-02-19
