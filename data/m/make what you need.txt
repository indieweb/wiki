{{stub}}
'''<dfn>Make what you need</dfn>''' is an IndieWeb [[principle]] that helps [[creator]]s focus on creating & publishing things prioritized by what they need & want for their own personal site.

Make tools for yourself first, not for all of your friends or ”everyone“. If you design tools for some hypothetical user, they may not actually exist; if you make tools for yourself, you actually do exist. 

By making something that satisfies your needs, and is backwards compatible for others, e.g. by practicing [[POSSE]], you benefit immediately, without having to convince anyone else. If and when others join, you all benefit.

== Metaphors ==
The following metaphors may also be help explain this principle, depending on which resonate the most with folks:
=== Cook What You Want ===
Cook what you want is the counterpart (preceding) to eat what you cook, and a metaphor for focusing your IndieWeb efforts on your own wants & needs first. 

=== Scratch Your Own Itch ===
[[scratch your own itch|Scratch your own itch]] was the previous expression of this principle, but as a metaphor.
