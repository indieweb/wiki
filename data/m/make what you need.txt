{{stub}}
'''<dfn>Make what you need</dfn>''' is an IndieWeb [[principle]] that helps [[creator]]s focus on creating & publishing things prioritized by what they need & want for their own personal site.

Make tools for yourself first, not for all of your friends or ”everyone“. If you design tools for some hypothetical user, they may not actually exist; if you make tools for yourself, you actually do exist. 

By making something that satisfies your needs, and is backwards compatible for others, e.g. by practicing [[POSSE]], you benefit immediately, without having to convince anyone else. If and when others join, you all benefit.
