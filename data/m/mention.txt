{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>mention</dfn>''' is a [[post]] which links to another post without explicitly being in response to it. In contrast, a [[reply]], [[like]], or [[repost]] are explicit responses to a post.

'''See also''': [[webmention]], the plumbing used to notify posts that they’ve been linked to

A mention is not really a “type” of post from the publisher’s perspective (i.e. there is no “mention” UI), as any sort of post which can link can implicitly be a mention, ''as well'' as potentially being in response to another post.

For example, [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4WVNHg/ this post] is an explicit [[reply]] to [https://mapkyca.com/2014/this-game-looks-fascinating-how-accurate-are-the-physics-involved this post], and at the same time an implicit mention of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkDOOsGg-9I this URL].

Mentions typically don’t fit into comment/reply threads and therefore are often displayed separately, or in a more compact manner.

Unlike a [[like]], a mention is not implicitly emotionally positive — a link is not always an endorsement.

== IndieWeb examples displaying mentions to posts ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
Aaron displays mentions to posts on aaronparecki.com in an “other mentions” section below likes, reposts and comments, as well as giving the mention count in feed views ([http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/06/01/2/indieweb example]).

=== Barnaby Walters ===
Barnaby displays mentions to posts on waterpigs.co.uk inline chronologically with other responses, but in a more compact form that explicit comments, and displays mention counts in feed views ([http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4T3FSd/ example]).

== Other Examples ==

=== Mastodon ===
Examples of [[Mastodon]] doing completion support (instance-local and federated-wide):

Noted above, @AreOh is ''local'' to the instance that @jalcine is on. However, everything else below are people that @jalcine follows.
== Mention Versus Reply ==
A webmention get sent when you link to another website. A [[reply]] is a specific post that requires markup on the link to indicate that someone is publishing a reply rather than a generic mention.

A key difference is the overall goal of the post. If the purpose of al the content is to reply to content somewhere else on the web then use [[reply]]. 

If the intent is to use a link in an article where the reply is in support of the purpose of the post, rather than the purpose of the post itself use a mention
