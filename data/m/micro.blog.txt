'''<dfn>[http://micro.blog micro.blog]</dfn>''' is an indie microblogging platform started by [http://www.manton.org/ Manton Reece], which supports [[microformats|microformats2]], [[Webmention]], and [[Micropub]].

== Overview ==
The [[Jekyll]]-based platform supports posting of [[notes]] (up to 280 characters). [[photos|Photos]] can be posted to the service (using Micropub) or pulled in via [[RSS]].

The project was launched in beta on 2017-04-23 following a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing Kickstarter campaign] beginning in January 2017 in which 3,080 backers pledged $86,696. The project was originally called [http://www.manton.org/2016/07/pre-announcing-snippets-today.html Snippets.today].

Once can bring their own [[projects|project]] and [[personal-domain]] to the service and post to it via RSS or purchase a hosted microblog for $5/month with a free 10-day trial.

__TOC__
== Indieweb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} uses micro.blog/aaronpk to automatically syndicate his main aaronparecki.com website feed
* {{t}} uses micro.blog/t to automatically syndicate his main tantek.com website feed file (updates.atom)
* {{chrisaldrich}} - experimenting with a [https://c.micro.blog hosted site] (during beta roll-out at least to see how well it supports IndieWeb)
** I've mapped over my [[personal-domain]] using CNAME as described [http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/ here].
** It includes the RSS feed of my [[Known]] site which feeds those status updates into the system. People who reply on them within micro.blog send [[webmention|webmentions]] back to the original post in a straightforward manner. WordPress RSS feeds work similarly.
* {{jeremycherfas}} uses micro.blog/jeremycherfas to syndicate portions of https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/ feed and posts from https://jeremycherfas.net 
* {{colinwalker}} uses micro.blog/colinwalker to syndicate multiple feeds from the self-hosted WordPress blog https://colinwalker.blog 
* {{cleverdevil}} uses micro.blog/cleverdevil to syndicate several of the feeds from his self-hosted Known site https://cleverdevil.io.
** I've also been working with the JSON Feed community to see if additional content types can be represented - https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues/51
* {{eli_oat}} uses micro.blog/eli to syndicate content from his self-hosted website, https://eli.li
* {{matthiasott}} uses micro.blog/matthiasott to syndicate the microblog JSON feed from his website, https://matthiasott.com/microblog
* {{addyourself}}

== Getting Help ==
Discussion directly centered around the project as well as help/support, and reporting bugs can be found on [https://microblogging.slack.com multiple micro.blog specific Slack channels]. Bugs can also be reported on [https://github.com/microdotblog/issues/ Github].

== Personal domain ==
One can map over their [[personal-domain]] using CNAME as described [http://help.micro.blog/2015/custom-domains/ here]. This will allow you to own the URLs relating to the service; doing so will make it possible for you to move to other platforms in the future if you wish.

== Themes ==
A variety of [[mf2]] compatible themes are included with paid subscriptions that use the hosted service. At launch none would pass the [[Indiewebify.me]] tests as they didn't include h-card or h-entry, but they're improving support over time. They do have h-feed and h-entry as of 2017-05-02.

=== Avatars ===
Avatars on the service use [[Gravatar]] as described in the [http://help.micro.blog/2015/profile-photos/ help pages].

=== Rel-me ===
The hosted version of Micro.blog supports [[rel-me]] fields for one's primary website as well as for [[Twitter]] and [[GitHub]]. Putting your hosted micro.blog URL into your Twitter and GitHub account "Web Site" fields on their respective account settings pages and putting your usernames into the micro.blog fields at http://micro.blog/account/apps and saving will allow one to easily and quickly [http://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=micro.blog log into the Indieweb wiki] using [[IndieAuth]].

As of early July 2017 micro.blog supports [[rel-me]] with Instagram as well as support for micropub client [[OwnYourGram]].

=== Website Verification for non-hosted blogs ===
Details for verifying one's non-hosted site can be found at http://help.micro.blog/2017/web-site-verification/

== Syndication ==
=== from micro.blog ===
micro.blog supports [[POSSE]] to [http://help.micro.blog/2016/cross-posting-twitter/ Twitter] with a paid account and also supports other services for free via [http://help.micro.blog/2015/cross-posting-ifttt/ IFTTT].

=== to micro.blog ===
The service allows one to configure multiple [[RSS]] feeds to syndicate content into the service.

== Apps ==
=== Micropub ===
Because micro.blog supports [[Micropub]] a variety of [[Micropub/Clients|clients]], including [[Quill]] can be used to post to the platform.

At launch, the app wasn't in the App Store yet, but one can [https://micro.blog/beta add oneself to the beta list] to receive an invite via Apple's TestFlight.

=== MarsEdit ===
Paid users of the service can use [http://help.micro.blog/2015/using-marsedit/ MarsEdit] to post to the service.

=== MacOS Desktop Client ===
[http://matthewroach.me/ Matthew Roach] has built a [http://matthewroach.me/micro-blog-desktop/ MacOS desktop client] on the electron framework using the micro.blog API. A request has been made for it to support micropub. Currently you can follow your timeline, see you mentions and favorites and reply to posts.

=== Android ===

Various projects can easily support posting into the ecosystem. Some being seen in the early days of the service (with posts/details/code about custom set ups) include:

=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] is one of the more common platforms in use with micro.blog, including by its founder [http://www.manton.org/ Manton Reece] who self-hosts and uses a slightly modified version of the Twenty Twelve theme.

==== Code / Plugins ====

=== Known ===
[[Known]] can be used almost out of the box to self-host a microblog and easily syndicate content from status updates directly into micro.blog via RSS (typically with a URL of the form http://knownexample.com/content/statusupdates/?_t=rss). Other post types can by syndicated as well.

== Criticism ==
While the service includes a lot of value and is easy to configure and use, it has the following disadvantages:
* It doesn't support posting a much broader variety of post types beyond [[notes]] or [[photos]]
* It isn't (yet?) open source to allow users to add their own functionality if they wish
* Self-hosting isn't available, though one can map their own [[personal-domain]] to it.
* Outbound webmentions are fully supported but only incoming webmentions from sites which have registered on the platform using their sending base URL.
* Data export isn't supported at launch, although is expected to be supported shortly
* There doesn't seem to be a simple way to natively post replies (either with the hosted or non-hosted versions) in a way which allows the user to thread replies properly and still own the content of the reply.

== FAQ ==

=== Is there a self-hosted version of micro.blog? ===
'''Q:''' Is there a self-hosted version of micro.blog? [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-14#t1484391374044000]

'''A:''' Not currently. You can map your domain to micro.blog or run your blog on your own domain and syndicate to micro.blog via [[RSS]]. The micro.blog platform is not currently open source, although maybe eventually will be. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-14#t1484404128247000]

=== Is Micro.blog an example of an [[reader|integrated reader]]? ===
'''Q:''' Is Micro.blog an example of an [[reader|integrated reader]]? (Also: Can you follow external feeds on micro.blog?) - Asked in #indiechat, so not logged.

'''A:''' Micro.blog's reader only displays content from other micro.blog users. To read a feed via micro.blog, the publisher of that feed must create a user account on micro.blog and syndicate their content there.
* Potentially confusing wording on the micro.blog [http://micro.blog/about about page] on 2017-06-21 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170621173422/http://micro.blog/about archive.org copy]): <blockquote>Integrated timeline from blogs<br />Browse posts from friends, powered by RSS and indie microblogs.</blockquote>
* However, the [http://micro.blog/discover discover page] appears to only allow users to find other users on the site.
