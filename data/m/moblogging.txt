    '''<dfn>moblogging</dfn>''' is a historical portmanteau of "[[mobile]]" & "[[blogging]]" from the early 2000s, using a mobile device (typically a mobile feature phone with built-in camera) to write, capture, and post [[note]]s, [[photo]]s, and even [[video]] to your blog, that people successfully did despite predating [[Twitter]] and mobile native smartphone apps in general!

== Mobile photo video reaction ==
