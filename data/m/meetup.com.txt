'''<dfn>[http://meetup.com Meetup.com]</dfn>''' is an [[event]] silo for creating and/or finding small gatherings in your local community who share your interests, sometimes used by some [[Homebrew Website Club]] cities to organize local HWC meetups, [https://www.wired.com/story/why-wework-is-buying-meetup/ acquired in 2017] by [[WeWork]].

== POSSE to Meetup ==
* As of [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/02/17/meetup-bridgy-support/ 2020-02-16] [[Bridgy]] offers [https://brid.gy/about#meetup-rsvp Bridgy publish functionality] for syndicating [[RSVP]]s for [[event]]s on Meetup from one's website to Meetup.

== Features ==
(this section is a stub, please expand it if you're a user of meetup.com)
* create [[group]]s
* create [[event]]s in groups
* join groups
* [[RSVP]] and/or post [[comment]]s to events
* API: https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/
* ...

== Criticism ==

* They are quite expensive; once a meetup group reaches a certain size they charge money to the group organizers, and the prices are a lot for the features they offer.
* Ever since [[WeWork]] bought them out they've been trying to find more ways of monetization, for example [https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges?mpId=9038 charging $2/RSVP] or charging for API access.


== Alternatives ==

* https://gettogether.community/ -- open source/federated meetup clone
