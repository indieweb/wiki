=== Discovery of nearby events ===
When logged in, the homepage displays nearby events based on your selected location and proximity. Location could be changed by searching a city name or postal code. Proximity could be changed to 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, or "any distance." Selecting a date in the calendar on the right side would filter events for that date only.

== Criticism ==

* They are quite expensive; once a meetup group reaches a certain size they charge money to the group organizers, and the prices are a lot for the features they offer.
* Ever since [[WeWork]] bought them out they've been trying to find more ways of monetization, for example [https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges?mpId=9038 charging $2/RSVP] or charging for API access.


== Alternatives ==

Hosted services:

* [[Meetable]] - an open source, self-hostable IndieWeb [[friendly]] platform that is also used for [[IndieWebCamp]]s and [[Homebrew Website Club]] events.
