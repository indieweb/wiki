'''<dfn>[http://meetup.com Meetup.com]</dfn>''' is an [[event]] silo for creating and/or finding small gatherings in your local community who share your interests, sometimes used by some [[Homebrew Website Club]] cities to organize local HWC meetups, [https://www.wired.com/story/why-wework-is-buying-meetup/ acquired in 2017] by [[WeWork]].

=== Discovery of nearby events ===
When logged in, the homepage displays nearby events based on your selected location and proximity. Location could be changed by searching a city name or postal code. Proximity could be changed to 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, or "any distance." Selecting a date in the calendar on the right side would filter events for that date only.

== Criticism ==

* They are quite expensive; once a meetup group reaches a certain size they charge money to the group organizers, and the prices are a lot for the features they offer.
* Ever since [[WeWork]] bought them out they've been trying to find more ways of monetization, for example [https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges?mpId=9038 charging $2/RSVP] or charging for API access.
* Several [[accessibility]] concerns have been raised with the platform as a whole. In November 2022, seemingly to try and counteract these issues, Meetup added an accessibility overlay to the site. Overlays are highly controversial and broadly seen as an anti-pattern by accessibility specialists, so this was met with strong condemnation. After initially removing the overlay due to the backlash, they quietly reinstated it a day later.
** "Welp, time to reconsider @Meetup as a platform for accessibility / disability meet-ups. I have no interest using a platform that knows so little about the community it regularly serves." [https://twitter.com/aardrian/status/1592146089310052354 @aardrian]
** Wordpress Accessibility Meetup look to move away from the platform in response: [https://wptavern.com/meetup-com-raises-concerns-with-new-accessibility-overlay Meetup.com raises concerns with new accessibility overlay]
