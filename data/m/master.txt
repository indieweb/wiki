'''<dfn>master</dfn>''' is an archaic term that became a convention with the introduction of git where it had problematic origins, that typically referred to the primary or main branch of a git repository; in the context of IndieWeb there are ongoing efforts to rename the term in various GitHub repositories usually to “main”.
