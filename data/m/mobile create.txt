'''<dfn>mobile create</dfn>''' is the act and UI for creating a new post on or from a mobile device, which is both more common and more challenging than using a laptop to [[create]] posts.

== Challenges ==
Mobile note creation is particularly challenging for various reasons:
* less reliable network (thus possible loss of user data if depending on JS / AJAX)
* smaller displays (less space to see what you're typing)
* touch keyboards (clumsier / less accurate than physical tactile keyboard)
