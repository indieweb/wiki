'''<dfn>most people</dfn>''' is a “[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word weasel word]” phrase  (also <dfn>some people</dfn> or <dfn>a lot of people</dfn>) that attempts to make a point by appealing to an abstract authority and sometimes statements with it are a softer version of the [[antipatterns#mass_adoption|mass adoption antipattern]]; instead of worrying about “most people”, focus on [[making what you need]] and using it.
