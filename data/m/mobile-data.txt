=== Freedom Pop ===

Freedom Pop is a discount mobile provider which offers "freemium" mobile plans. {{beesbuzz.biz}} has been an occasional user in the past, while attempting to use this to get away from traditional phone service. General findings:

* The billing is purposefully confusing, and "free" isn't really free; for unused accounts they sneak random small charges onto peoples' credit cards with various nonsensical explanations for why it's "required"
* Coverage is spotty at best, and even in major metro areas it experiences frequent dropouts and low availability
* The available devices are always a few generations behind, and the hardware appears to be poorly-refurbished returns to discount cellular providers
* If a device is unused for too long it will be shut off, and getting it reactivated is an onerous process
