'''<dfn>media fragment</dfn>''' is a way of linking to a part of a longer media file. There is a W3C spec for this at https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/.

== Why ==
=== Why link to ===
You should use a media fragment to link to a specific time index (or segment) of a media file if thatâ€™s the part you consider relevant, important, or want to make a comment about, [[like]], [[repost]], [[tag-of|tag]], [[bookmark]], etc.

Similarly, if you are referencing an audio or video post, you should use a media fragment to link to a specific time index or segment.

=== Why handle media fragments ===
You should support handling media fragments on permalinks to your media (e.g. [[audio]], [[video]]) posts so that links to them from others (see above) will playback for the listener/viewer what was intended by the author of the link.

=== How to handle media fragments ===
You can handle media fragments on your HTML page audio/video post permalinks, so others can use media fragments on your post URLs, by following [https://github.com/aaronpk/clone-media-fragment the instructions here].

[http://jonudell.net/ Jon Udell] has done some experimentation for Hypothes.is to create HTML5 Audio, HTML5 Video, and Youtube Clippers for making media fragments easier. Links to his tool and details on the process can be found at [https://blog.jonudell.net/2018/03/10/open-web-annotation-of-audio-and-video/ Open web annotation of audio and video].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(stub to be expanded with subsections for each)

IndieWeb examples of sites and post permalinks that support media fragments:

* {{aaronpk}}
* {{schmarty}}

== Implementations ==
There is some support in browsers (Firefox, Webkit, Chrome) for temporal media fragments (start,end) on direct media file URLs.

* Example: [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/02/17/9/video.mp4#t=10,20 https://aaronparecki.com/2017/02/17/9/video.mp4#t=10,20] starts at 10 seconds and stops at 20

Additionally, {{aaronpk}} and {{schmarty}} have a bit of Javascript on their websites which copies the media fragment from the HTML page to the inline media player, so you can use media fragments on their post URLs. See "How to" above for more details.
* [https://github.com/aaronpk/clone-media-fragment/blob/master/clone-media-fragment.js Open source JavaScript to do this automatically]

== Brainstorming ==
=== Spatial for area tags ===
Is there some way to use [https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#naming-space spatial media fragments] (image fragments?) to figure out another iteration of [[area-tag]]s?
