A '''<dfn>movie</dfn>''' is long form audio video content that IndieWeb sites write posts about, sometimes [[watch]] posts, and also the monthly topic of the [[IndieWeb Movie Club]].

== How to ==
=== How to link to ===
Different community members link to different sites to reference movies, such as [[Wikipedia]], [[IMDb]], and [[JustWatch]].

'''Consider spoilers!''' One consideration when linking to pages about movies are spoilers at the destination.
* Example: Wikipedia pages about movies usually have a plot summary with spoilers

Some movie publishers (production studios) have their own websites with permalinks to their movies (usually without spoilers). 
* [https://movies.disney.com/ Disney movies], e.g. [https://movies.disney.com/tron TRON]
* ... add more examples of publishers with movie permalinks

== IndieWeb Examples ==
For examples of linking to movies, see [[watch#IndieWeb_Examples]] which has plenty of examples of IndieWeb sites linking to movies.

If you actually publish and host your own movies on your own domain / personal site (in contrast to a silo like [[YouTube]]), add yourself below!
