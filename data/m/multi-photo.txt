{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>multi-photo</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>carousel</dfn> on [[Instagram]]) is a [[photo]] post with multiple adjacent photos, either in a series, or tiled / arranged in some layout.

Not a multi-photo post:
* photos interspersed with narrative text, use an [[article]] instead.
* one or more photos with one or more videos, use a [[collection]] post
* multiple photos paired with their own captions, use a [[collection]] post
* someone else’s photos, use a [[repost]] instead, or at least wrap it in an [[h-cite]].
See [[#Instead_use|Instead use]] for more on posts similar to multi-photo posts.

== Why ==
If you have multiple photos that are one or more of:
* from a single event
* tell a story together
* parts of the same thing
they make sense to publish together in a single post. It makes more sense to both viewers, and to you as the writer of a caption that describes them all, to post multiple such related photos together as a multi-photo post.

== Instead use ==
There are many posts that have multiple photos or other images in them, despite that, they are not necessarily "multi-photo" posts, they are often something else.

=== article ===
If your photos are interspersed with text, especially narrative text, you're writing an article that happens to contain photos. Your post as a whole is not just a "multi-photo" post.
* Use [[article]] instead

Examples:
* https://snarfed.org/2003-11-20_were_not_in_kansas_any_more

=== collection ===
If your photos are specifically delimited by their own captions (or person-tags), e.g. photo1, caption1, photo2, caption2, etc. then you're essentially posting a collection of entire photo posts, since each photo(n) + caption(n) pairing is its own photo post.
* Use [[collection]] instead. Post each photo(n) + caption(n) as its own singular photo post at its own permalink, and include them all in a single [[collection]] post.

If your one or more photos are in a set with one or more videos, then you need to use a collection to distinguish separate photos vs poster images for the videos.
* Use [[collection]] instead. Post each photo or video (with optional poster-image photo) as its own singular post at its own permalink, and include them all in a single [[collection]] post.

=== repost or cite ===
Especially for the above two cases, if you're posting photos which are not yours you should either
* Use [[repost]] to repost the permalink where the author of the photo published it themselves.
* OR if the author has no original, then cite (using [[h-cite]]) the photo as part of your post.
Otherwise if you just use <code>u-photo</code> directly yourself to embed someone else's photos or artwork, since you're the author of your post you're implying they're <em>your</em> photos, that you photographed them or drew them which is kind of like plagiarism.

== How ==
=== How to publish ===
Like a photo post, but with multiple "u-photo" images.

(needs a minimal h-entry multiple u-photo markup example!)

=== How to POSSE ===
* [[Twitter]]
** Supports up to 4 photos on their multi-photo posts, and you can use [[Bridgy]] Publish or [[silo.pub]] to POSSE to Twitter (numerous IndieWeb folks do)
** If you have more than 4 photos in your multi-photo post, you can try POSSEing them to Twitter four at a time in a [[tweetstorm]], e.g.
*** {{kartikprabhu}} original 6 photo multi-photo: https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/ithaca-winter
*** Tweetstorm with all 6 across two tweets: https://twitter.com/kartik_prabhu/status/965020396927029248
* [[Facebook]]
** no known examples of POSSEing a multi-photo to a Facebook multi-photo post, though it should be theoretically possible.
* [[Flickr]]
** no known examples of POSSEing a multi-photo to Flickr, though it should be theoretically possible by POSSEing a multi-photo to a Flickr Album, which is similar to a [[collection]]
* [[Instagram]]
** only manual POSSEing to Instagram is possible, yet a few folks do regularly manually POSSE multi-photo posts to Instagram. See '''[[Instagram#POSSE]]''' for details. Examples:
** {{t}} [http://tantek.com/2017/090/t3/pretty-tiles-sky-sunrise since 2017-03-31] (2 photos)
*** manual POSSE to Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/BST1yEHlJ1J/
*** see also 2017-03-28 manual POSSE of photos from four original posts (3 photo posts, 1 multi-photo) to one Instagram post, yet omitting one of the photos from the IG multi-photo
**** original posts: http://tantek.com/t4nZ1 http://tantek.com/t4nZ2 http://tantek.com/t4nZ3 http://tantek.com/t4nZ4
**** Instagram POSSE: https://www.instagram.com/p/BSJ9wPjAHTF/
*** before that, {{t}} was manually PESOSing multi-photos from Instagram

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Sorted by earliest multi-photo posts first.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] to publish multi-photo posts [http://tantek.com/2015/352/t1/building-lights-clouds-heels-cab since 2015-352] which are [[note]] posts with embedded images at the start. He does the following:
# Uses [[Swarm]] iOS client to post photos at their locations (checkin [[venue]]s) soon after he takes them ([http://tantek.com/2017/089/t1/swarmapp-mobile-photo-posting since 2017-03-30], instead of Instagram 2015-352…2017-085). 
# Writes & posts a [[note]] on his own site that starts with a direct width960 .jpg URL of the photo image, then a space/linebreak, then direct original resolution of the .jpg URL, then at least one more .jpg width960 URL + .jpg original resolution URL, then caption.
# That "note" is auto-upgraded by [[CASSIS]]'s <code>auto_link</code> function into a multi-photo post by putting the <code>u-photo</code> class name on the [[auto-embed]] <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> of the JPG, since it's the first URL in the "note", and auto-linking it with the subsequent URL, then including any immediately subsequent JPG+URL pairs into additional <code>u-photo</code> embeds.
# Falcon automatically uses [[Bridgy]] Publish to [[POSSE]] the multi-photo as a photo post to both [[Twitter]] (first 4 photos per their limit), [[Facebook]] (only the first photo per limit), and [[Flickr]] (same one photo limitation), saving the resulting syndication URLs in storage.
# Uses [[Instagram]] iOS client to copy caption from original post, and manually choose and post same photos in the same order as in original post.
# Manually copy new [[Instagram]] multi-photo post permalink into original post as a syndication link.
* Previously 2015-352…2017-085:
*# Uses [[Instagram]] iOS client to post a (multi-)photo there.
*# Writes & posts a [[note]] on his own site that starts with a direct .jpg URL of the photo image, then a space/linebreak, then permalink of the Instagram post (auto-generated using the Instagram Bookmarklet), then at least one more .jpg URL + permalink, then caption.
*# That "note" is auto-upgraded by [[CASSIS]]'s <code>auto_link</code> function into a multi-photo post by putting the <code>u-photo</code> class name on the [[auto-embed]] <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> of the JPG, since it's the first URL in the "note", and auto-linking it with the subsequent URL, then including any immediately subsequent JPG+URL pairs into additional <code>u-photo</code> embeds.

=== Malcolm Blaney ===
{{mblaney}} uses [[dobrado]] and [[SimplePie]] on https://unicyclic.com to display multi-photo posts with a light box effect. The first photo found in the post is displayed, followed by a description containing the number of photos. Clicking on the photo brings up a light box and navigation options to view the rest of the photos.

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] to publish and POSSE multi-photo posts since 2016-08-06. 
* If the post has two photos, they are both 50% of the width of the post and a fixed height.
* If the post has three photos, they are 33% of the width of the post, and a fixed height, smaller than the 2-photo post.
* If the post has four or more photos, they are 50% of the width of the post, and a fixed height, slightly smaller than the 2-photo but larger than the 3-photo.
* The photos are always cropped to a fixed size. Clicking on a photo opens up the photo in a lightbox. (If JS is disabled, this is just a regular link to the full res photo)

Examples:
* https://aaronparecki.com/2016/08/03/11/ post with two photos ([https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/760953570623561728 posse copy])

== Reader Support ==
=== Monocle ===
[[Monocle]] supports displaying multi-photos, and has a special layout for posts with 3 photos.

[[File:monocle-multi-photo.png|600px]]

== Silo Examples ==
=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] added support for posting multiple (up to 10) square-cropped photos and videos in a single post [https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0mDB2gV_O/ as of 2017-02-22], as of 2017-03-10 (at least), allows [[person-tag]]ging per photo in the multi-photo, as of 2018-08-29 allows broader aspect ratios per post (all items in a post must be same ratio).

Limitations:
* items must have the same aspect ratio as the first item
* aspect ratio limited to ~16:9 wide or ~3:4 tall (need actual measures)
** e.g. you'll have to crop a pano at ~16:9
* no photo editing (e.g. rotation, trapezoidal adjustments) - filters only
* as of at least 2017-09-03 it is possible to adjust and edit the individual photos while posting

Launched with limitation (but no longer a problem)
* no person-tags - fixed 2017-03-10 or a bit earlier
* items must be square - [https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/29/instagram-multiple-photos-landscape-portrait/ fixed 2017-08-29]

==== Implementation details ====

The description below may be historical only. as of 2017-03-10 (probably earlier), at least on web, the individual photo permalinks now redirect to the multi-photo permalink.

''Each photo or video in an instagram multi-photo has its own shortcode hidden in the [[Instagram#Unofficial embedded JSON]]. You can use them to get permalinks for the individual photos and videos, where you can comment and like them separate from the multi-photo, both on web and in the app.''

''These individual photo/video pages aren't accessible through the web or app UI otherwise, so they seem to be an unintended implementation detail on Instagram's part. However, once you've liked an individual photo/video in a multi-photo, you can get to it in the app via "Posts you've liked."''

''For example, looking at the [https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0mDB2gV_O/ announcement multi-photo], the first individual video and photo are https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0lyx9APPC/ and https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0ly-bgMry/ , respectively.''

[[Granary]] extracts and exposes these individual permalinks. For example, click the individual large pictures in this converted microformats2 HTML: https://granary-demo.appspot.com/instagram/mikeyk/@self/@app/BQ0mDB2gV_O?format=html

Here's the corresponding mf2 JSON: https://granary-demo.appspot.com/instagram/mikeyk/@self/@app/BQ0mDB2gV_O?format=json-mf2

==== Earlier ====

Before this feature, Instagram users frequently posted collage images of multiple photos, often enough that Instagram even built their own separate app, ”Layout”, to help with the creation of these collage images (which are multi-photo posts arranged into a square or rectangle). Example:
* 2017-02-22: https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0mDB2gV_O/

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] added support for posting multiple (up to 4) photos in a single tweet (when? 2016? 2015?)
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/760953570623561728
* multi-photo using multi-tweets https://twitter.com/kartik_prabhu/status/965020396927029248 and https://twitter.com/kartik_prabhu/status/965020655078043648
* ... more URLs to examples of multi-photo tweets needed!

=== Swarm ===
[[Swarm]] sort of supports multi-photo posts as a secondary aspect of their [[checkin]] posts with up to 7 photos! 

See: '''[[checkin#Swarm]]''' for more details (since that's the primary post type supported by Swarm).
