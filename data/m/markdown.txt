'''<dfn>Markdown</dfn>''' is a way of writing and interpreting plain text so that it can optionally be converted to more explicitly meaningful or richly styled text like HTML. Markdown is often used in README files and some online discussion forums.

== Principles ==
=== Readability ===
As readable as possible is the most important Markdown design goal.[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/] <blockquote>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.</blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Indieweb participants using markdown on their personal site, for authoring text [[posts]] (e.g. [[notes]], [[articles]]), editing text, and sometimes publishing / syndicating text.

See and incorporate from [[storage#Markdown_plus_extensions]]

* [[User:Sandeep.io]] writes in markdown and publishes it directly in a hidden div. It is intended as lossless, plaintext content for comments and replies [http://www.sandeep.io/44 since 2013-06-11][http://www.sandeep.io/48]
* {{rhiaro}} uses markdown for post authoring and storage [http://rhiaro.co.uk/2013/10/metadata-parsing since 2013-10-13]. E.g.
** http://rhiaro.co.uk/posts/150403-2255_MicropubTest.md
* {{bret}} uses markdown for post authoring and storage since ????-??-?? E.g.
** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/master/_posts/quill.p3k.io/2015-03-28-173-of-unreleased-ap.md
** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/master/_posts/notes/2015-03-17-kilauea.md
** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/master/_posts/notes/2015-04-03-clbp.md
* {{bear}} uses markdown for [[articles]], small [[notes]] and [[webmention]]'s to keep his markdown "clean" each type of article is handled by a specific Jinja2 template. Since ????-??-?? (URL to MD source?)
* {{aaronpk}} uses markdown for post authoring and storage since ????-??-?? (URL to MD source?)

=== Alternatives ===
Lightweight markup alternatives to Markdown being used or considered by IndieWeb community members:
* '''[[MediaWiki]]''' syntax - just to edit our wiki
** (everyone)
* {{t}} '''[http://tantek.com/w/Markdown Thoughts on Markdown]''' - analysis, alternate syntax proposals, and some implementation
** needs a name

== Dialects ==
Markdown comes in many flavors...

* basic Gruber Markdown
* [https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/ Github-Flavored Markdown]
* StackOverflow Markdown
* MultiMarkdown
* [https://rawgit.com/converspace/markaround/master/README.html Markaround]
* kramdown (basic plus some extensions from PHP Markdown and Maruku)
* [https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/ Markdown Extra] ( also the base of many other flavor )
* ...

And has many extensions to the basic syntax:
* [http://maruku.rubyforge.org/proposal.html Meta-data syntax implemented by Maruku]

Summaries of Markdown flavors and specifications:
* http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/faq.html

There is a joint work on documenting expected behaviour and specification for extended features in an attempt called [http://spec.commonmark.org/ Commonmark]. While at first it looks like yet another flavour, due to the extensive documentation, it may as well become a common ground.

== Criticism ==
=== Not pretty ===
readable but not pretty - aaronpk in IRC

sometimes looks funny - bret in IRC

if it looks funny, it's failed as markdown [per its own overriding readability principle] - tantek in IRC

=== Underspecified ===
* Under-specified, leads to many implementations, fragmentation. e.g.,

GitHub-Flavored Markdown

<code><pre>
```php
code sample
```
</pre></code>

vs. kramdown

<code><pre>
~~~~php
code sample
~~~~
</pre></code>

vs. Python-Markdown with CodeHilite (though you can enable the <code>fenced_code</code> extension to support all three syntaxes in Python-Markdown)

<code><pre>
    :::php
    code sample
</pre></code>

=== Not escapable ===

Markdown has no way specified way of escaping characters when used in a Markdown context.

For example, the Gitlab Slack integration uses Markdown to mark up messages, which breaks when the commit-message contains Markdown characters.

Example: <code>Someone pushed *'remove all bla_* methods'*</code>

Becomes: <code>Someone pushed <strong>'remove all bla_</strong> methods'*</code>

=== considered harmful ===
[https://medium.com/@bbirdiman/markdown-considered-harmful-495ccfe24a52 Markdown considered harmful]

=== ugly enough to consider separate text plain ===
See: https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-06-03#t1464937740573
<blockquote>{{aaronpk}} it said i have to write the email in markdown. it didn't say it was going to send the markdown as the text/plain part of the email. the preview only showed it to me as html</blockquote>
<blockquote>{{t}} well if markdown adhered to its principles it would work *just fine* as the text/plain part</blockquote>

And: https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-06-03#t1464938023495
<blockquote>{{aaronpk}} wait does that mean my hyperlinks came through in markdown format too?</blockquote>
Thus pointing out the particularly ugly / plain text unfriendly format of links in Markdown, that it would cause surprise/consternation that such formatting might be shown to other users.

** "The problem with Markdown is that in its efforts to simplify it removes fundamental meaning from HTML by pretending they don't matter, for example, look at tables and their lacking accessibility" [https://carloseriksson.com/about/ @fiinixdesign] August 23, 2020

* Criticism: the fact that Markdown actually has its own file extension .md rather than "just" using plain text (and .txt) is a strong clue that it has in practice readily diverged from its original "key design goal" of "_readability_, that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions" (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#History) so much so that computers needed to be told when they could/should interpret text as Markdown.
