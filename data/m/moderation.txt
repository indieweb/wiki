<dfn>Moderation</dfn> is the process of holding [[comments]] for review by a human, and sometimes a source of frustration when a comment is written on another site that the commenter has no control over.

== Moderation Status ==
Under the current [[webmention]] specification there is no indication for when a comment is held for modification. 

In many systems, however, there is a response for human commenters that is visible, indicating that a comment has been accepted and is awaiting moderation by a human.

Just deleting it on one or other of them is likely not enough, as it could be brought back by sending the webmention again.

** "Moderation in this environment is a _nightmare_ of inconsistency and, instead of a faceless megacorporation, you get eight million individuals who have no idea what they are doing, no training, no accountability, and a lot of Ideas™ about what effective moderation should look likeMost of which are going to be wrong, but that's not even the point.  They will _still_ screw everything up and then be passive aggressive with youThis creates an incredibly uneven and inconsistent landing experience" [https://hachyderm.io/@hrefna @hrefna] February 18, 2023
