{{stub}}

'''<dfn>microsyntax</dfn>''' refers to short text conventions for conveying specific semantic meaning, such as an "@" prefix indicating a (user)name, or "#" prefix indicating a [[hashtag]] (both conventions popularized by [[Twitter]]).

== Why ==
=== Why author ===
When writing/authoring, it’s often easier to use a little bit of inline punctuation like an '@' or a '#' as a microsyntax to express some additional meaning rather than adding explicit markup or even [[markdown]].

== Brainstorming ==
A place to brainstorm indieweb microsyntax especially for plaintext [[notes]], and POSSEing of specific types of [[posts]] to plaintext-like [[POSSE]] destinations (e.g. [[Twitter]]])

(this overall section could use some gardening and updating, many of these never went anywhere and should likely be archived, and some have been implemented and should be documented with real world examples)

** We need pfefferle and acegiak to clarify their [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-06-21#t1371819076 use case]. Just adding links to the users domain in your post will send a webmention to the domain, so IMO it is unnecessary to prefix user domains with @ so I'm assuming they meant post urls. &mdash;[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]
*** The idea was to generate an easy mardownish way to generate semantic links, not really meant to display to any enduser - [[User:Notizblog.org|Matthias Pfefferle]]
** No one does this currently (any real world example?) - feels a bit forced. People already think of "@" as meaning "hey this person". - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:54, 21 June 2013 (PDT)
** -1 agreed, this example is forced and doesn’t reflect real world usage. @mentions succeeded because they were a paved cowpath, it defeats the object to try to repurpose them --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 16:07, 21 June 2013 (PDT)
** "we wanted a way to mark which one was the reply-to without needing to edit the html because we want the plugins to be accessible to non-technical wordpress users -  plus, adding the html manually would be tiresome, so we're trying to work out a way to make it quick and easy" -[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-06-22#t1371902255 acegiak]
** Seems OK to me but I've settled on <code><nowiki>re: http://example.com/some-post</nowiki></code> in my personal logs & recently on my site ([http://colintedford.com/2014/12/08.2120-kirby-kerberos/ e.g.1], [http://colintedford.com/2015/01/07.0407-month-year-archives-now-have-links-to-the-next-previous-time-periods-thanks-to-the-adjacent-archive-links-plugin/ e.g.2]; just using as minimal reply context for now as I'm pretty sure others do). I've been only using it at the start of an entry but I think you could safely use it anywhere. [[User:Colintedford.com|Colintedford.com]] 21:11, 7 January 2015 (PST)

Some <span id="Research">research</span>:
