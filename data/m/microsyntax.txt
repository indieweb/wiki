{{stub}}

'''<dfn>microsyntax</dfn>''' refers to short text conventions for conveying specific semantic meaning, such as an "@" prefix indicating a (user)name, or "#" prefix indicating a [[hashtag]], both of which are commonly used in [[note]] posts on personal sites.

== Why ==
=== Why author ===
When writing/authoring, it‚Äôs often easier to use a little bit of inline punctuation like an '@' or a '#' as a microsyntax to express some additional meaning rather than adding explicit markup or even [[markdown]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Many IndieWeb sites have examples of @-names, #hashtags, etc. See their specific sections for now (though many of those are for features in general, and need some amount of filtering for actual microsytnax examples). We could collect microsyntax-specific examples here, in addition to these links to other IndieWeb Examples sections, until we have enough of each.
* [[person_mention#IndieWeb_Examples]]
* [[person-tag#IndieWeb_Examples]]
* [[hashtags#IndieWeb_examples]]
* [[footnote#IndieWeb_Examples]]
* [[auto-emoji#IndieWeb_Examples]]
* ...

== microsyntaxes ==
Visible ‚Äî some microsyntaxes are preserved in text and linked.
* @-[[mention]] ([[at-names]], [[at-domains]], [[at-at]])
* #-[[hashtag]]
* ...

Processed and hidden ‚Äî some microsyntaxes are processed from text and replaced, and not usually visible when presented:
* :[[auto-emoji]] ‚Äî text syntax of ":" (emoji-name) ":" like <code>:smile:</code> for üòÑ and other standard Unicode [[emoji]], as well as other custom names for custom emoji in software like [[Mastodon]], and services like [[Discord]] and [[Slack]]
* ...

== History ==
{{section-stub}}
Both <kbd>@name</kbd> and <kbd>#hashtag</kbd> conventions were popularized by [[Twitter]] when they decided to auto-link such text in tweets.

== Brainstorming ==
A place to brainstorm indieweb microsyntax especially for plaintext [[notes]], and POSSEing of specific types of [[posts]] to plaintext-like [[POSSE]] destinations (e.g. [[Twitter]]])

(this overall section could use some gardening and updating, many of these never went anywhere and should likely be archived, and some have been implemented and should be documented with real world examples)

** We need pfefferle and acegiak to clarify their [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-06-21#t1371819076 use case]. Just adding links to the users domain in your post will send a webmention to the domain, so IMO it is unnecessary to prefix user domains with @ so I'm assuming they meant post urls. &mdash;[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]
*** The idea was to generate an easy mardownish way to generate semantic links, not really meant to display to any enduser - [[User:Notizblog.org|Matthias Pfefferle]]
** No one does this currently (any real world example?) - feels a bit forced. People already think of "@" as meaning "hey this person". - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:54, 21 June 2013 (PDT)
** -1 agreed, this example is forced and doesn‚Äôt reflect real world usage. @mentions succeeded because they were a paved cowpath, it defeats the object to try to repurpose them --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 16:07, 21 June 2013 (PDT)
** "we wanted a way to mark which one was the reply-to without needing to edit the html because we want the plugins to be accessible to non-technical wordpress users -  plus, adding the html manually would be tiresome, so we're trying to work out a way to make it quick and easy" -[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-06-22#t1371902255 acegiak]
** Seems OK to me but I've settled on <code><nowiki>re: http://example.com/some-post</nowiki></code> in my personal logs & recently on my site ([http://colintedford.com/2014/12/08.2120-kirby-kerberos/ e.g.1], [http://colintedford.com/2015/01/07.0407-month-year-archives-now-have-links-to-the-next-previous-time-periods-thanks-to-the-adjacent-archive-links-plugin/ e.g.2]; just using as minimal reply context for now as I'm pretty sure others do). I've been only using it at the start of an entry but I think you could safely use it anywhere. [[User:Colintedford.com|Colintedford.com]] 21:11, 7 January 2015 (PST)

=== travel leg ===
{{t}} have seen (and used) the following as a [[travel]] leg microsyntax, mostly for flights, but also trains.

Plain text:
* <samp>SFO>FRA</samp> ‚Äî {{t}} in Swarm/Foursquare. flight from SFO airport to FRAnkfurt airport
** <samp>PDX-SFO</samp> - {{aaronpk}} in https://aaronparecki.com/2023/01/18/20/travel

** <samp>PDX -> SFO</samp> - {{aaronpk}} in https://aaronparecki.com/2013/09/30/15/

* <samp>VIC>BTN</samp> ‚Äî train from London VICtoria to Brighton
With emoji:
* <samp>PDX‚úàÔ∏èSFO</samp> - {{aaronpk}} in https://aaronparecki.com/2014/12/20/23/

=== one line timeline or progress ===
{{t}} has been brainstorming about how to represent a timeline on a single line.

E.g. evolution / lineage of current feed/stream formats

* <samp>CDF->RSS->RSS0.92->RSS2.0->Atom->Atom/AS1->AS1/JSON->AS2/JSON(LD)</samp>
* <samp>CDF->-RSS->-RSS0.92->-RSS2.0->-Atom->-Atom/AS1->-AS1/JSON->-AS2/JSON(LD)</samp>

Longer with years:

* <samp>CDF[1997]->RSS[1999]->RSS0.92[2000]->RSS2.0[2002]->Atom[2005]->Atom/AS1[2011]->AS1/JSON[2011]->AS2/JSON(LD)[2017]</samp>
* <samp>CDF[1997]->-RSS[1999]->-RSS0.92[2000]->-RSS2.0[2002]->-Atom[2005]->-Atom/AS1[2011]->-AS1/JSON[2011]->-AS2/JSON(LD)[2017]</samp>

== microsyntax spec replace markdown ==
{{t}}: document the spectrum between microsyntax and [[markdown]] and consider a microsyntax spec that would be a building block for a larger replacement for [[markdown]].
