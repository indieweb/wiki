Hi [given-name]!

Thank you for making [IndieWebCamp CITY YEAR] a success! From the enlightening talks and in-depth discussions on Saturday, to the successful launch of several new personal websites and other projects on Sunday, we are extremely pleased with how it went.

Here's a quick recap of the weekend, and ways to keep up and keep in touch about future IndieWeb events in [CITY] and beyond. We won't email you at this address again!

== Friday ==

[A number of] attendees met up at [pre-party location] for food, beverages, and discussion of the Camp to come! Thanks to [Sponsor] for sponsoring this pre-event social!

== Saturday ==

[insert day 2 group photo]

Sunday was a day of making, with [number] of us convening at [day 2 location] to create and hack on our personal sites and projects. We kicked off by having each participant stick notes for their planned projects on the wall for accountability, then dove in!

After a [describe lunch, thank sponsor if any], we wrapped up our work and demoed what progress we had made.
