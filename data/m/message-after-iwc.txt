IndieWebCamp [[Organizers]] should send a <dfn>'''message after an IndieWebCamp'''</dfn> to participants that thanks them, summarizes the awesome things that happened, preferably with some group photos, includes information about upcoming [[events]] including the next few [[IndieWebCamps]], and provides ways for folks to stay in touch.

This page is one such template that has been used for at least [[2019/NYC|IndieWebCamp NYC 2019]].

== Friday ==

[A number of] attendees met up at [pre-party location] for food, beverages, and discussion of the Camp to come! Thanks to [Sponsor] for sponsoring this pre-event social!

== Saturday ==
[insert day 1 group photo]

We kicked things off at the [location] with [food/coffee] thanks to [sponor or Open Collective Donors]!

[Describe any opening talks and link to speaker and/or slides]

We then made a schedule of attendee-facilitated discussions, covering topics like [three or so topics], and many more!

You can find the full list of discussions, including session notes and video streams, at https://indieweb.org/YEAR/CITY/Schedule

== Sunday ==
[insert day 2 group photo]

Sunday was a day of making, with [number] of us convening at [day 2 location] to create and hack on our personal sites and projects. We kicked off by having each participant stick notes for their planned projects on the wall for accountability, then dove in!

After a [describe lunch, thank sponsor if any], we wrapped up our work and demoed what progress we had made.

[Describe notable projects like how many folks launched a new website]. You can find the full details on what was demoed at https://indieweb.org/YEAR/CITY/Demos

Thank you for making [IndieWebCamp CITY YEAR] a success! From the enlightening talks and in-depth discussions on Saturday, to the successful launch of several new personal websites and other projects on Sunday, we are extremely pleased with how it went.

Here's a quick recap of the weekend, and ways to keep up and keep in touch about future IndieWeb events in [CITY] and beyond. We won't email you at this address again!

Dear IndieWebCampers:

Thank you for participating in [IndieWebCamp CITY YEAR] last weekend! 


You Made [IndieWebCamp CITY] Awesome!

We heard inspiring keynotes from community members [KEYNOTER 1], [KEYNOTER 2], and [KEYNOTER 3]. 
You can rewatch their talks here: https://indieweb.org/2020/West/Schedule#Keynotes as well as all our breakout sessions.

You gave awesome lightning personal site demos that inspired us as a whole; facilitated and participated in lots of breakout session topics on Saturday; and demonstrated numerous personal site and indieweb community improvements on Sunday.

You should all be very proud of what you wrote, designed, built, coded, tested, and shipped in just two days!

If you have a moment, write a blog post summarizing your IndieWebCamp experience, and we'll add it to our growing list of stories and reflections:
* https://indieweb.org/2020/West#Posts


We Did A Lot

We were originally planning our 10th annual IndieWebSummit this past weekend, and after we had to cancel that like all other in-person events, we decided to try organizing an online IndieWebCamp instead to see if we could make something summit-like happen for the community. Together (yes, including all of you!) we had:

* 50+ participants over two days
* 12+ hours of videos of talks, sessions, demos: https://indieweb.org/2020/West/Schedule#Saturday
* 3 lightning keynotes: https://indieweb.org/2020/West/Schedule#Keynotes 
* 28 personal site intros: https://indieweb.org/2020/West/Intros
* 9 breakout sessions: https://indieweb.org/2020/West/Schedule#Sessions
* 20+ new sites, features, wiki pages demonstrated: https://indieweb.org/2020/West/Demos


What Next?

Excited from the weekend and want to keep the momentum going? Here are five things you can do to stay active and in touch:

1. Chat: https://chat.indieweb.org/ — there's folks active in our chat channels from around the world at all hours, pop in and say hi!

2. Meetups:  https://events.indieweb.org/tag/hwc — every Wednesday evening we have a community hosted 90 minute informal meetup to chat, show, and tell all things IndieWeb. It's like a little informal IndieWebCamp session where all levels are welcome. Subscribe to the iCalendar (ICS) feed to get weekly reminders!

3. Newsletter: https://indieweb.org/this-week-in-the-indieweb — want to take a breather and get summaries once a week? Get This Week In The IndieWeb in your email inbox, or of course also in your social reader or feed reader as h-feed or RSS.

4. T-shirts? You might have noticed many participants wearing IndieWebCamp t-shirts throughout the weekend. We have some from last year's summit, and if you participated this weekend and don't have one, email your t-shirt size / fit preference / shipping address to us at west@indieweb.org and we'll see if we have one!

5. Blog! Last but not least, please post about your own IndieWeb hopes, dreams, aspirations, struggles, accomplishments, surprises, and whatever else comes to mind, using the #indieweb hashtag, and #indiewebcamp regarding anything camp-specific.


Thank You

Thanks to everyone who showed up and participated, facilitated, took notes, wikified, volunteered, and demonstrated! We especially want to thank our keynote speakers [KEYNOTE 1 NAME], [KEYNOTE 2 NAME], and [KEYNOTE 3 NAME] for putting together inspiring, informative, and optimistic talks.

If you'd like to share your feelings about how camp, attendance, or experiences could be better, please email the organizers at west@indieweb.org. We're always looking for ways to improve our programs in the future. We can treat your feedback as anonymous if you prefer, just let us know.

The IndieWeb never sleeps. See you on chat, our meetups, stay tuned for an IndieWebCamp East in the fall, and maybe a few Pop-up Sessions until then!

Thank you!

Your camp organizers, volunteers, video archivers, and code of conduct contacts:
[ORGANIZERS], [CoC CONTACTS]

P.S. If you'd like to help organize future camps or smaller events in your city or timezone, please let us know and we're happy to help you with resources and support to make that happen.
