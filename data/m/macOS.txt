'''<dfn>macOS</dfn>''' (previously <dfn>OS X</dfn> and <dfn>Mac OS X</dfn>) is short for Macintosh (Mac) Operating System (OS), runs on [[Apple]] Mac laptops and desktops, and has both native applications for interacting with IndieWeb sites and server software for developing an IndieWeb site.

Versions of the Mac operating system prior to Mac OS X were called "Mac OS" and prior to that "System" (ie. System 6).
