** automatic updates to core, plugins and themes
** backups on a daily, weekly, monthly basis
* security
* speed
* less (or no) downtime
* additional development tools including features like version control and specific areas for development, staging, and production


== Disadvantages ==
* Price – managed hosting (some basic plans start at $25+/month) is more expensive when compared to shared hosting, which can be found for $3-4/month.

* Limits – managed hosting often limits the types of WordPress sites, themes, and plugins that one can run. Some hosts may not allow you to run some plugins because of security, functionality, or speed considerations.
