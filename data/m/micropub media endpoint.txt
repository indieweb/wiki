'''<dfn>micropub media endpoint</dfn>''' is a [[micropub-endpoint|Micropub endpoint]] that exclusively handles file uploads and returns a URL that can be used in a subsequent Micropub request.

== Indieweb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} has used a standalone media endpoint since 2016-11-02. The source code is available [https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/4bee1753688ca9f3036d6f31377edf14 on GitHub]
* {{martymcguire}} has used [[Spano]] as a Micropub media endpoint on his site since [https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/26/122700/ 2017-01-26].

== Brainstorming ==

=== Query the last thing uploaded ===
A Micropub client should be able to query the Media Endpoint to find the last photo uploaded. This would allow a post interface to appear with the photo pre-populated. This mechanism ends up treating the Media Endpoint as a kind of account-level clipboard, so you could upload a photo from one device then finish the post on another device.

This also gets closer in line with the way the Wordpress uploader works, where images are stored in a media gallery and can be added to posts later. Might need to explore that API to see how they handle querying the list of media.

This is currently produced by:

* {{aaronpk}} on his media endpoint media.aaronpk.com

And consumed by:

* [[Quill]] - queries the media endpoint to find the last uploaded image and pre-populates the photo in the note interface

=== Response Body ===

The Micropub spec doesn't define a particular response body when uploading to the media endpoint. It only defines that the response include the created URL in the Location header. However, some tools are easier to work with if they can use the response body instead of having to parse the HTTP headers.

This should also be the same response format used when querying the endpoint to find the last thing uploaded.

If the Accept header prefers <code>text/plain</code> then the response body is just the full URL. Otherwise, a JSON object with a "url" property is returned.

<pre>Content-Type: text/plain

https://media.aaronpk.com/filename.jpg</pre>

<pre>Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://media.aaronpk.com/filename.jpg"
}</pre>

This response currently produced by:

* {{aaronpk}} in his media endpoint on media.aaronpk.com

And consumed by:

* {{aaronpk}} - a iOS Workflow that I created to upload to my media endpoint requests a text/plain response and uses the body as the URL, copying it to the clipboard. that was easier than adding a JSON parser to the Workflow.
