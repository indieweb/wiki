'''<dfn>micropub media endpoint</dfn>''' is a [[micropub-endpoint|Micropub endpoint]] that exclusively handles file uploads and returns a URL that can be used in a subsequent Micropub request.

== Indieweb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} has used a standalone media endpoint since 2016-11-02. The source code is available [https://gist.github.com/aaronpk/4bee1753688ca9f3036d6f31377edf14 on GitHub]
* {{martymcguire}} has used [[Spano]] as a Micropub media endpoint on his site since [https://martymcgui.re/2017/01/26/122700/ 2017-01-26].

== Brainstorming ==

=== Query the last thing uploaded ===
A Micropub client should be able to query the Media Endpoint to find the last photo uploaded. This would allow a post interface to appear with the photo pre-populated. This mechanism ends up treating the Media Endpoint as a kind of account-level clipboard, so you could upload a photo from one device then finish the post on another device.

This also gets closer in line with the way the Wordpress uploader works, where images are stored in a media gallery and can be added to posts later. Might need to explore that API to see how they handle querying the list of media.
