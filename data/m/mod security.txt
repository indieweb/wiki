'''<dfn>mod_security</dfn>''' is a [[web application firewall]] for the [[Apache]] web server.

== Issues ==
=== Blocking Requests ===
Sometimes mod_security may block otherwise-legitimate requests. If you get an error message like:

<blockquote>Not Acceptable!<br>
An appropriate representation of the requested resource could not be found on this server. This error was generated by Mod_Security.</blockquote>

you will probably need to contact your [[hosting]] provider to have them change some of the security settings.
