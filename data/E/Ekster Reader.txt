https://indieweb.org/Ekster_Reader

'''<dfn>[https://github.com/pstuifzand/ekstereye Ekster Reader]</dfn>''' is a Microsub reader, running in a browser. It connects directly to a Microsub server without its own Microsub proxy backend. For this to work you do need a Microsub server that handles CORS headers, to allow access from the browser. This also applies for the IndieAuth endpoint. A version is hosted at https://reader.p83.nl/
