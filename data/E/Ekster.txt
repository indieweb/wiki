<dfn>'''[https://github.com/pstuifzand/ekster Ekster]'''</dfn> is a [[Microsub]] server written in Go.

It was created by [[User:Peterstuifzand.nl|Peter Stuifzand]] on 2018-02-16 and released on 2018-05-16.

== Running Ekster ==

See the README.md on Github.

== Features ==

* Realtime updates where supported by WebSub.
* Three different channel types included:
** '''sorted-sets''': default channel type
** '''streams''': channel type based on streams
** '''null''': channel type that doesn't remember items
* Include and exclude items. Easily create a Mentions channel, by adding your name to keywords to include.
* Include can be combined with the null channel type, so you only see matching items.
* Support for Microsub protocol: channel management, previews and more.
* A command-line tool that supports all commands Ekster supports is included to administer the server.

== Examples with ek ==

=== Follow urls from an OPML file (new method) ===

    # Connect to your homepage
    ek connect https://example.com/
    
    # Import OPML
    ek import opml hotlist.opml
    
    # Or, export OPML
    ek export opml > subscriptions.opml

=== Follow all urls from an OPML file (old method) ===

From: https://p83.nl/posts/701

Follow urls from an OPML file, by combining xmlstarlet and ek.

    # Connect to your homepage by following steps (open url and allow auth)
    ek connect https://example.com/
    
    # Create a channel for the feeds, this will show the ID.
    ek channels "Imported feeds"
    
    # Gather the feeds from the file and pipe these to "ek follow ID"
    xmlstarlet sel -t -v "//outline/@xmlUrl" hotlist.opml  | xargs -n 1 ek follow mtjTXQELiT60Wtm5ArVcLo5G

=== Retrieve all feeds ===

If you need to get your subscriptions directly from Aperture (or Ekster) you need "ek" (the microsub command line client) and run the following one liner: 

    ek channels | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 ek follow
