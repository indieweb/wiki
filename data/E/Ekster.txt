== Running Ekster ==

See the README.md on Github.

== Examples with `ek` ==

=== Follow urls from an OPML file (new method) ===

    # Connect to your homepage
    ek connect https://example.com/
    
    # Import OPML
    ek import opml hotlist.opml
    
    # Or, export OPML
    ek export opml > subscriptions.opml

=== Follow all urls from an OPML file (old method) ===

From: https://p83.nl/posts/701

Follow urls from an OPML file, by combining xmlstarlet and ek.

    # Connect to your homepage by following steps (open url and allow auth)
    ek connect https://example.com/
    
    # Create a channel for the feeds, this will show the ID.
    ek channels "Imported feeds"
    
    # Gather the feeds from the file and pipe these to "ek follow ID"
    xmlstarlet sel -t -v "//outline/@xmlUrl" hotlist.opml  | xargs -n 1 ek follow mtjTXQELiT60Wtm5ArVcLo5G

=== Retrieve all feeds ===

If you need to get your subscriptions directly from Aperture (or Ekster) you need "ek" (the microsub command line client) and run the following one liner: 

    ek channels | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 ek follow
