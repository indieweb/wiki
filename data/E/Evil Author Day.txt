'''<dfn>Evil Author Day</dfn>''' is celebrated on February 15th as a time to post unfinished drafts. It originated in the fanfiction community but was suggested in [https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/03/have-the-delete-your-drafts-day-for-our-blogs-but-also-evil-author-day/ a post] by {{sarajaksa}} as an alternative to dealing with draft posts than [[Delete Your Drafts Day]].

== Why ==

{{sarajaksa}} notes that posting drafts is a way to overcome perfectionism and fear when writing, allowing others to enjoy creations, even if unfinished.

<blockquote>This allows the people to still partake in the joy of creation, even if it was not finished. It also allows the authors to not have to deal with perfectionism or with the guilt of why they are no longer interested in it.

</blockquote>

== Why not ==

Evil Author Day can be celebrated alongside [[Delete Your Drafts Day]] if an author determines a draft is not worth publishing.
