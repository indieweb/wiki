'''<dfn>Evil Author Day''' is a day, when we encourage people to post their unfinished drafts or parts of their drafts, even and especially if they no longer have any intention to finish them. It is celebrated on the 15th of February. It was suggested in [https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/03/have-the-delete-your-drafts-day-for-our-blogs-but-also-evil-author-day/ a post] by {{sarajaksa}} as a response to the [[Delete Your Drafts Day]] as a different spin on how to deal with drafts.
