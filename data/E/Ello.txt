'''<dfn>[https://ello.co Ello]</dfn>''' is microblogging [[silo]] similar to [[Twitter]] or [[Tumblr]] for posting short status update [[notes]] and [[pictures]]. Ello offers threaded [[comment]]ing and a minimalist "designy" feel to it with some unusual (but nice) [[UX]] animations & interface ideas.  As of Sep. 2014 Ello is currently invite-only.

== Features ==
Ello provides the following features as observed from others use thereof:

* [[request-invitation]] &amp; [[login]] with a email address, user chosen username, password
** indieweb equivalent: [[signin]] via [[RelMeAuth]] or [[IndieAuth]]
* [[follow]] and unfollow
* [[reader]] UI with an integrated UI to:
* [[post]] a [[note]] in [[Markdown]] at a [[permalink]] with:
** [[autolink]]ing of URLs, @-names, in note/reply
** embedding of [[photos]] via Markdown
** [[comments-display]]
** comment creation UI (but no permalinks for comments, nor do they show up on your own profile)
** [[photo]] posts that show very large photos e.g. when zoomed out on a cinema display
* [[profile]] page (equivalent of indieweb [[homepage]]) configuration including
** header image
** [[icon]]
** name (as displayed next to posts)
** website (does not support [[rel-me]])
** plain text bio (unknown size limit if any)

__TOC__

== Indieweb Support ==
{{gRegor}} inquired about adding [[microformats2]] support or other indieweb technology like [[webmention]]. A developer responded that he was not personally familiar with them, but would give it a look. [https://ello.co/gregorlove/post/0LGJ_01RwAKKrB5iDfqO1w]

{{user|ben.thatmustbe.me|Ben Roberts|https://ben.thatmustbe.me/image/static/icon_64.jpg}} inquired about support on 2015-08-12 [https://twitter.com/dissolve333/status/631479746962927617]  and the response was positive and indicated that it was "on the roadmap"

== API ==
Ello has not announced an official API yet, but it appears there is one. Unofficial documentation: https://gist.github.com/conatus/cc665f917d5558c123bc

== POSSE to Ello ==
There doesn't appear to be a way to automatically POSSE to Ello.
=== Jon Pincus ===
[[User:Achangeiscoming.net|Jon Pincus]] has manually POSSE'd a reply from his site (running [[Known]]) to Ello:
* original reply: http://stream.tapestrymaker.net/2014/cshirky-good-points-is-it-possible-to-provide-flow-when
* manual POSSE comment - first comment on https://ello.co/cshirky/post/a99yZmd6ZPMwM5Yatk0rRQ
** Ello lacks permalinks for comments
* "reshare" POSSE tweet, automatically generated by Known: https://twitter.com/TapestryMaker/status/518446785413402624

If you initially create a status update on Known, you can add the ello link by clicking on *Reply to a site*.  If instead you create a post (in which the headline will be used for the tweet) you'll need to edit your known post to include the link to ello.  [http://stream.tapestrymaker.net/2014/-womenwhotech-great-topic-on-ello-really-sad-to-hear Here's an example]; I put this HTML is at the top of the reply

 <nowiki><div class="reply-text" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 15px; 
                      line-height: 24.6399993896484px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
 <p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em !important;">
 <span class="icon-reply"></span> 
 Replied to 
 <a href="https://ello.co/womenwhotech/post/08obTue-ISU3v4pGh7szsw" rel="in-reply-to" 
               class="u-in-reply-to">a post on <strong>ello.co</strong> </a>
 </p>
 </div>
 </nowiki>

== Prominent Accounts ==
The following accounts are interesting for their content, commentary, or authorship:
* https://ello.co/waxpancake - example of lots of text, fairly critical of Ello itself
* https://ello.co/thomashawk - beautiful photos, shows off Ello's large photo display in photo posts, e.g. view on a zoomed out window on a cinema display

==Design==
The following <span id="Praise">praiseworthy</span> design aspects of Ello are worth noting and further analysis / reverse engineering for indieweb [[design]]s.

=== Fairly Effective Use of Whitespace ===
Once past the landing page, Ello opts for a completely blank, white canvas upon which their users' content is placed. Individual posts are set off from other posts and page content only by effective use of whitespace, rather than background-colors, lines, or flashy ui.

=== Large Photo Display ===
View https://ello.co/thomashawk zoomed out on a cinema display and see how well the photos scale. Though they could perhaps even do better going full bleed with the images. Thomas blogged about this on his own site:
* http://thomashawk.com/2015/07/ads-on-social-networks-suck-ello-co-san-francisco-ca.html

== Plumbing ==
It appears that Ello is run on [[Heroku]]. This was discovered by accidentally opening [http://ello.co. http://ello.co.] (note the trailing period) and seeing a "Heroku: No such app" error message.

== Funding ==
* [http://betabeat.com/2014/10/ello-takes-5-5-in-vc-money-signs-a-legally-binding-charter-to-never-sell-ads-or-data/ Ello Takes $5.5 Million in VC Money, Signs a Legally-Binding Charter to Never Sell Ads or Data]

== Criticism ==
=== Unsustainable VC Funding ===
See criticism on this theme written up by Andy Baio on Ello itself:
* https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/oy73kFfDdhOPh8Jv9z9pFA

Exit notes of Aral Balkan
* https://aralbalkan.com/notes/ello-goodbye/

=== Ugly Permalink URLs ===
See above ^^^ (ello.co/username/post/gibberish-line-noise-hex)

* not sure this is really fair, there has been no criticism of twitter on this when it uses only numbers instead of numbers and letters. {{user|ben.thatmustbe.me|Ben Roberts|https://ben.thatmustbe.me/image/static/icon_64.jpg}} 11:57, 12 August 2015 (PDT)

=== Desktop centric ===
"Don't try using it on mobile, very desktop centric" - {{kevinmarks}}[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-09-24/line/1411595501627]

=== No permalinks for comments ===
There's no way to link to a comment, e.g. [[User:Achangeiscoming.net|Jon Pincus]]'s first comment here https://ello.co/cshirky/post/a99yZmd6ZPMwM5Yatk0rRQ which he manually POSSE'd from his own site: http://stream.tapestrymaker.net/2014/cshirky-good-points-is-it-possible-to-provide-flow-when

=== No rel-me support ===
There's apparently no way to enter your own personal site into your profile and have ello link back to it with [[rel-me]]. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-09-24/line/1411595542893]

=== No Official API ===
:''See [[Ello#API|API]].''

=== No Export ===
No way to export your content / data. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-09-24/line/1411595542893]

=== Back/Forward Buttons ===
Ello seems to add extra things in the history and makes the browser navigation buttons act strangely, at least in Firefox.

=== Unreadable Font ===
[[File:ello-post.jpg|500px|right|Monospace font on Ello]]
Ugly monospaced-font, with small font-size makes it hard to read. Font declaration in Firefox reads "AtlasTypewriterRegular","Andale Mono","Consolas","Lucida Console","Menlo","Luxi Mono",monospace -- [[User:Kartikprabhu.com|Kartik]]

=== Errors and Downtime ===
On 2014-10-03 I noticed the main Ello [[interface]] seemed to stop working. Clicking a note permalink or comments icon did nothing. When I tried to view the profile directly, this error message was displayed. The errors did not appear to persist for more than 30 seconds, though. ‚Äî {{gRegor}}

== Self-description ==
''Ello is a simple, beautiful, and ad-free social network created by a small group of artists and designers. We originally built Ello as a private social network. Over time, so many people wanted to join Ello that we built a public version of Ello for everyone to use.'' [https://ello.co/wtf/post/about-ello About]
