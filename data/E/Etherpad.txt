'''<dfn>[http://etherpad.org/ Etherpad]</dfn>''' is an open source, real-time, collaborative document editing tool that the IndieWebCamp community often uses to take notes during [[IndieWebCamps]] at https://etherpad.indieweb.org/.

* Warning: placing emoji into an etherpad will cause it to crash and not save your notes

== How to take notes during IndieWebCamp ==

* During session scheduling, each session should have a [[hashtag]]. Use that hashtag to add a link to the session grid, following the format: <nowiki>https://etherpad.indieweb.org/</nowiki>'''hashtag'''
* Open the link to that session's etherpad.
** If the etherpad has not been used before, copy/paste the template below to start it.
** Otherwise, if the etherpad has been used before, leave archived notes of previous sessions, enter a few blank lines at the top, then copy/paste the template.
* Fill in the IndieWebCamp city, year, session name, session time, and participants names/URLs. Note the session facilitator beside their name.
* Start taking notes collaboratively under the "Notes" heading.
** Use * for bulleted lists
** Use # for numbered lists
** Avoid indenting for nested lists, instead use multiple, e.g. ** is a second-level bullet

=== Etherpad Template ===
<pre>IndieWebCamp CITY YEAR
Session: SESSION_NAME
When: START_DATE_AND_TIME

== Participants ==

=== Archiving IndieWebCamp notes ===
At the end of an IndieWebCamp, the notes will be moved from their etherpads to their respective session’s wiki page. This means moving the contents verbatim and leaving a link to the wiki behind for future visitors. The wiki page should also include a link to the original etherpad. The wiki pages can then be elaborated on and edited to fit the style of the wiki instead of freehand notes.

* Add a one-line [[dfn]] naming the session and linking to the IndieWebCamp event page.
** For example: <code><nowiki>'''&lt;dfn&gt;SESSION_NAME&lt;/dfn&gt;''' was a session at [[YEAR/CITY|IndieWebCamp CITY YEAR]].</nowiki></code>
** This first sentence will appear in the [[this-week]] newsletter.
* Add the etherpad URL: <code><nowiki>Notes archived from: [ETHERPAD_URL]</nowiki></code>
* If video is available, add a link to it: <code><nowiki>Video: {{videoduration|link=https://video.example.com/|duration=12:59}}</nowiki></code>
** See [[Template:videoduration]]
* Categorize the page by including <code><nowiki>[[Category: IndieWebCamp CITY YEAR]]</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>[[Category: YEAR sessions]]</nowiki></code>, replacing the city and year.


The following snippet can be put on the etherpad after moving its contents:
