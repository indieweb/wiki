'''<dfn>[https://www.11ty.io/ Eleventy]</dfn>''' is a [[JavaScript]] based [[static site generator]] that allows the user to select their own preferred template engine and theme, which in practice can and does enable use of [[microformats2]]. 

Eleventy is not a JavaScript framework and does not come with a preinstalled theme or configuration although there are many examples of [https://www.11ty.io/docs/starter/#starter-projects starter projects]. 

Like other [[static site generator]]s the learning curve for Eleventy assumes prior experience of writing [[HTML]].

** "In this Eleventy course, we go from a completely empty directory to a full-blown marketing site for a design agency, and along the way, we dive really deep into Eleventy and front-end development best practices. Over the course of 31 written lessons, split over 4 modules, you will learn core Eleventy platform knowledge—step-by-step—to build out a real-world project. The linear project structure helps your learning because you’re working with a real context, rather than foo bar or fizzbuzz. This also means you’ll actually achieve something at the end that you can build on, too! It’s not just a course about Eleventy, either. We’re learning how to build a fast, lightweight website that’s progressively enhanced with the user at the forefront. You’re going to learn some solid HTML, CSS and accessibility best practices just by completing this course. Finally—if that wasn’t enough to convince your already—you’ll learn about design implementation, details and refinement to achieve a solid, professional end-product. You don’t need to be an experienced developer to take this course. All you need is basic HTML and CSS skills, with some optional JavaScript skills. Everything is explained, in detail, in a friendly, conversational manner, and if you get stuck in any of the lessons, you can download the project files, so you’ll have no blockers and you’ll maintain your momentum. Because it’s a written course, it’s available offline by default too. Now is the time to get into the Jamstack, with static site generators. By taking this course, you’re going to get a solid head-start in that. So what are you waiting for? Grab a copy of Learn Eleventy From Scratch today and let’s get started with building something awesome. We’re giving copies of Learn Eleventy From Scratch away to those who are often overlooked in the tech industry. Your instructor for Learn Eleventy From Scratch is Andy Bell—an educator and consultant designer & developer—based in the U.K. Andy has worked in the design and web industries for well over a decade and in that time, has worked with some of the largest organisations in the world, like Harley-Davidson, BSkyB, Unilever, Oracle, Capita, Vice Media and the NHS. Over these years, Andy has worked on both extremely large projects for huge organisations and tiny projects for small startups. This has given him a vast experience over a large variety of work, which means the tutorials and courses you read on this site have a pragmatic, flexible approach to them. No shoe fits all sizes, but Andy aims to get as close as possible to that with Piccalilli."
