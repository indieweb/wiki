Like other [[static site generator]]s the learning curve for Eleventy assumes prior experience of writing [[HTML]].

** "In this Eleventy course, we go from a completely empty directory to a full-blown marketing site for a design agency, and along the way, we dive really deep into Eleventy and front-end development best practices."
** "It’s not just a course about Eleventy, either. We’re learning how to build a fast, lightweight website that’s progressively enhanced with the user at the forefront. You’re going to learn some solid HTML, CSS and accessibility best practices just by completing this course."
** "You don’t need to be an experienced developer to take this course. All you need is basic HTML and CSS skills, with some optional JavaScript skills. Everything is explained, in detail, in a friendly, conversational manner, and if you get stuck in any of the lessons, you can download the project files, so you’ll have no blockers and you’ll maintain your momentum. Because it’s a written course, it’s available offline by default too."
