'''<dfn>[https://www.11ty.io/ Eleventy]</dfn>''' (abbreviated 11ty) is an open source [[JavaScript]] based [[static site generator]] that allows the user to select their own preferred template engine and theme, which in practice can and does enable use of [[microformats2]]. 

Eleventy is not a JavaScript framework and does not come with a preinstalled theme or configuration although there are many examples of [https://www.11ty.io/docs/starter/#starter-projects starter projects].
