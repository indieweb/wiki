<span class="p-summary">'''Welcome to upcoming IndieWeb <dfn>events</dfn>, listing indieweb-related events, and events with indieweb sessions!'''</span>. For other meanings of "event", see:
* ''indie event [[posts]], see: '''[[event]]'''''
* ''indie event listings pages, see: '''[[events list]]'''''
* ''IndieWeb event '''[[Planning]]'''''

== Upcoming ==
Upcoming indie web related events. Feel free to add any indieweb-related events, free or paid, whole camps/conferences, or even individual indieweb related talks at conferences.
<!--
Please try to keep to neutral time tense (e.g "Bill Smith on indie web"). Include as many details about the event as possible, including precise start end times, room number, etc. Move details to the (events/..) wiki page for the event itself. Include the information here to start with with h-event markup.

For all IndieWebCamp conferences, please mark as "big" in the top-level class (either span or div) so that they are pulled to the front page as the next conference. All events without "big" in the class are assumed to be "small" (i.e. homebrew meetings, etc).

If it's an upcoming IndieWebCamp, use style="background:#FF9" on the h-event element to highlight it!

Soonest first. Edit after the following HTML comment closer:  *****************        -->

=== 2019 ===
Add IndieWeb related 2019 events here! Even if they're tentative, month-level granularity, or potential, adding events helps us avoid conflicts when [[planning]] [[IndieWebCamps]].

=== How To Add An Event ===
To add an event to the IndieWeb Events Listing:
# edit this page 
# copy paste one of the event templates in the source into the correct most-recent-first spot in the '''Upcoming''' list above!

In addition, for [[Homebrew Website Club]] (HWC) events:
# Add it to [[Template:Homebrew Website Club]] (if it‘s an unusual / off-rhythm date)
# Create the event permalink page for it (copy paste from a previous HWC permalink page) if necessary
#* Ensure the venue in the [[h-event]] has a p-location property with [[h-card]] so that it will appear in the [[this-week]] newsletter
# Add yourself to the RSVP on that page for the city you’re (co-)organizing
# Update the '''[https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=next-hwc&redirect=no next-hwc], [[Events]]''' wiki pages with the new event info

Ideally also:
* Create an indie [[event]] on your own site for the HWC for your city, ideally with [[invitation]]s to people that have previously participated.
* [[POSSE]] that indie event to one or more applicable event silos/commons of your choice (e.g. [[Calagator]], [[Facebook]])
* Add those URLs to the section for your city 
* Be sure to have [[Bridgy]] or some other [[backfeed]] setup to receive RSVPs from the silo copy/copies to your indie event.
* Invite folks on the silo/silos you POSSEd to, to the POSSE copy/copies.


Previous steps that have been automated or are no longer necessary!
* Update [[Main_Page]] with the new event
** Automated by [[Kaja]]!
* Update the [[IRC]] '''/topic''' (or ask an admin) to link to that next HWC (assuming that is the next one)
** Unnecessary because the /topic now always links to [[next-hwc]]!
* Update the '''[[Sidebar]]''' ''text'' (or ask an admin to do so) with the list of cities
** Unnecessary because we have stopped listing the HWC cities in the sidebar

| event_description = This talk presents an empirical study of Bridgy — a tool for engaging with social media without surrendering ownership of one’s content to platforms. Jack Jamieson will describe how Bridgy’s developers attempt (and sometimes fail) to maintain a service that is simultaneously antagonistic and dependent upon corporate platforms. This study presents a glimpse at what the Web might look like in the future, and identifies challenges and strategies for getting there.

== IndieWebCamps ==

{{IndieWebCamp}}

== Homebrew Website Club meetups ==
{{Homebrew Website Club}}

== Past Years ==
{{events}}

== Why ==
Why do we use this page for events?

Some of the benefits of using the wiki for events include:
* There is no fixed template for events, so we are able to add new sections to the event page as needed
* The layout of event pages has evolved over time as our needs have changed

== Issues ==
{{main|Organizers#Events_Issues}}
== Brainstorming ==
{{main|Organizers#Events_Brainstorming}}
We need to make section or link to the how-to organize events from the events page. I would make a sidebar section for events and put Organize an Event there as well or just add it above sponsor

== See Also ==
* [[event]] - event posts
* [[events list]] - pages of upcoming or past events
* [[Planning]] - planning for more IndieWebCamps!
