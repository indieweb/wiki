[[Category:Organizing]]

<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>events</dfn>''' are either [[event]] posts, actual [https://events.indieweb.org/ indieweb-related events] (including [[planning]] thereof), or other events with indieweb-related sessions.</span>

Specifically:
* indieweb event [[posts]], see: '''[[event]]'''
* indie event listings pages, see: '''[[events list]]'''
* '''[https://events.indieweb.org/ Upcoming indieweb-related events]'''
* indieWeb event '''[[Planning]]'''

== Upcoming ==
Upcoming events: <span style="font-size: 1.8em;">[https://events.indieweb.org/ events.indieweb.org]</span>

* '''[https://events.indieweb.org/ics/events.ics âœšðŸ—“ Subscribe to IndieWeb Events (ICS)]'''

Feel free to add any indieweb-related events, with free or paid tickets, whole camps/conferences, or even individual IndieWeb related talks at conferences. 
* See: '''[[Events#How_To_Add_An_Event|How to add an event]]''' for instructions.

<!--
Please try to keep to neutral time tense (e.g "Bill Smith on indie web"). Include as many details about the event as possible, including precise start end times, room number, etc. Move details to the (events/..) wiki page for the event itself. Include the information here to start with with h-event markup.

For all IndieWebCamp conferences, please mark as "big" in the top-level class (either span or div) so that they are pulled to the front page as the next conference. All events without "big" in the class are assumed to be "small" (i.e. homebrew meetings, etc).

If it's an upcoming IndieWebCamp, use style="background:#FF9" on the h-event element to highlight it!

Soonest first. Edit after the following HTML comment closer:  *****************        -->

__TOC__

=== How To Add An Event ===
To add an event to the IndieWeb Events Listing:
# Log in to the wiki
# Visit https://events.indieweb.org and click "Add an Event"
# Complete the required information, adding as much detail about the event as possible

In addition:

* '''For conferences with IndieWeb talks, or related meetups like micro.blog'''
*# Clone an existing event page for a conference (e.g. [https://events.indieweb.org/2020/04/beyond-tellerrand-zLOeoFTwPJJK Beyond Tellerrand]) <!-- TODO: post a related meetup on events.indieweb.org then update this: or related meetup (e.g. ([[events/2019-06-04-micro-blog-wwdc|2019 micro.blog at WWDC]]) -->
*# Edit the event '''name''', '''dates & times''', '''venue location'''
*# Remove inapplicable content like tags, description, etc
*# Edit as necessary, and save!

* '''For [[Homebrew Website Club]] (HWC) events''':
*# Ensure you've added the <code>hwc</code> tag to the event
*# Make sure you RSVP to the event you're (co-)organizing, by either clicking the "I'm Going" button or posting an [[rsvp|indie RSVP]]
*# Ideally also:
*#* Create an indie [[event]] on your own site for the HWC for your city, ideally with [[invitation]]s to people that have previously participated.
*#* [[POSSE]] that indie event to one or more applicable event silos/commons of your choice (e.g. [[Calagator]], [[Facebook]])
*#* Add those URLs to the section for your city 
*#* Be sure to have [[Bridgy]] or some other [[backfeed]] setup to receive RSVPs from the silo copy/copies to your indie event.
*#* Invite folks on the silo/silos you POSSEd to, to the POSSE copy/copies.


Previous steps that have been automated or are no longer necessary!
* Update [[Main_Page]] with the new event
** Automated by [[Kaja]]!
* Update the [[IRC]] '''/topic''' (or ask an admin) to link to that next HWC (assuming that is the next one)
** Unnecessary because the /topic now always links to [[next-hwc]]!
* Update the '''[[Sidebar]]''' ''text'' (or ask an admin to do so) with the list of cities
** Unnecessary because we have stopped listing the HWC cities in the sidebar

== Why ==
Why do we use this page for events?

Some of the benefits of using the wiki for events include:
* There is no fixed template for events, so we are able to add new sections to the event page as needed
* The layout of event pages has evolved over time as our needs have changed

== Issues ==
{{main|Organizers#Events_Issues}}

== Brainstorming ==
{{main|Organizers#Events_Brainstorming}}
We need to make section or link to the how-to organize events from the events page. I would make a sidebar section for events and put Organize an Event there as well or just add it above sponsor
