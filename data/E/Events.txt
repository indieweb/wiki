* ''For indie event [[posts]], see: '''[[event]]'''''
* ''For indie event listings pages, see: '''[[events list]]'''''

== Upcoming ==
Upcoming indie web related events. Feel free to add any indieweb-related events, free or paid, whole camps/conferences, or even individual indieweb related talks at conferences.
<!--
Please try to keep to neutral time tense (e.g "Bill Smith on indie web"). Include as many details about the event as possible, including precise start end times, room number, etc. Move details to the (events/..) wiki page for the event itself. Include the information here to start with with h-event markup.

templates:

one day event:

*<span class="h-event vevent"><span class="dt-start dtstart">YYYY-MM-DD</span>: <span class="p-name summary">[[events/YYYY-MM-DD-event-session-title|Event Session Title]]</span> at <span class="p-location location">event-location</span>. <span class="p-description description">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</span>. <span class="u-url url">http://example.com</span></span>

multiple day event:

*<span class="h-event vevent"><span class="dt-start dtstart">YYYY-MM-DD</span>..<abbr style="border:0" class="dt-end dtend" title="YYYY-MM-EE">EE</abbr>: <span class="p-name summary">[[events/YYYY-MM-DD-event-session-title|Event Session Title]]</span> at <span class="p-location location">event-location</span>. <span class="p-description">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</span>. <span class="u-url url">http://example.com</span></span>

For all IndieWebCamp conferences, please mark as  "big" in the top-level class (either span or div) so that they are  pulled to the front page as the next conference. All events without "big" in the class are assumed to be "small" (i.e. homebrew meetings, etc).

If it's an upcoming IndieWebCamp, use style="background:#FF9" on the h-event element to highlight it!

Soonest first. Edit after the following HTML comment closer:  *****************        -->

=== 2017 ===
Add IndieWeb related 2017 events here! Even if they're tentative, month-level granularity, or potential, adding events helps us avoid conflicts when [[planning]] [[IndieWebCamps]].

=== How To Add An Event ===
To add an event to the IndieWeb Events Listing, just edit this page and copy paste one of the event templates in the source into the right most-recent-first spot in the '''Upcoming''' list above!

In addition, for [[Homebrew Website Club]] (HWC) events:
* Add it to [[Template:Homebrew Website Club]]
* Create the event permalink page for it (copy paste from a previous HWC permalink page) if necessary
** Ensure the venue in the [[h-event]] has a p-location property with [[h-card]] so that it will appear in the [[this-week]] newsletter
* Add yourself to the RSVP on that page for the city you’re (co-)organizing
* Update the '''[[next-hwc]], [[Main_Page]], [[Events]]''' wiki pages with the new event info
* Update the '''[[Sidebar]]''' ''text'' (or ask an admin to do so) with the list of cities
* Update the [[IRC]] '''/topic''' (or ask an admin) to link to that next HWC (assuming that is the next one)
And ideally:
* Create an indie [[event]] on your own site for the HWC for your city, ideally with [[invitation]]s to people that have previously participated.
* [[POSSE]] that indie event to one or more applicable event silos/commons of your choice (e.g. [[Calagator]], [[Facebook]])
* Add those URLs to the section for your city 
* Be sure to have [[Bridgy]] or some other [[backfeed]] setup to receive RSVPs from the silo copy to your indie event.
* Invite folks on the silo/silos you POSSEd to, to the POSSE copy/copies.

== IndieWebCamps ==
{{main|IndieWebCamps}}
{{IndieWebCamp}}

== Homebrew Website Club meetups ==
{{Homebrew Website Club}}

== Past Years ==
{{events}}

== Why ==
Why do we use this page for events?

Some of the benefits of using the wiki for events include:
* There is no fixed template for events, so we are able to add new sections to the event page as needed
* The layout of event pages has evolved over time as our needs have changed

== Issues ==
=== Mediawiki awkward for events ===
One of our more awkward uses of MediaWiki is using it as an events calendar. 
=== Multiple places to update ===
* Adding an event like an IndieWebCamp or Homebrew Website Club involves updating several locations
** Home page list of events needs to be updated manually
** Events on [[events]] are updated manually
** [[Template:IndieWebCamp|IWC]] or [[Template:Homebrew_Website_Club|HWC]] templates are updated manually
** /next-iwc and /next-hwc redirects are updated manually

=== Creating new HWC pages is tedious ===
* Copy+pasting to create new HWC pages is tedious, and is typically only done [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-01-27/line/1453947587493 by Gregor and Tantek]
* Entering all the HTML required to format the page as an h-event is error prone

=== Wiki pages require manual RSVP ===
* Not easily able to add new features like accepting [[RSVPs]] to the wiki pages themselves

=== Event pages need better presentation ===
* The event pages look like wiki pages, with little visual hierarchy, and are not immediately recognizable as an event you can RSVP to to the general public

== Brainstorming ==
=== Problem Statements ===
* Lots of manual work to create / update events on indieweb.org (most often for [[Homebrew Website Club]], updating [[Events]], [[Main_Page]], and [[Sidebar]].
* Group event sites are hard, especially ones that take into account any particular community's needs

=== Non-goals ===
* Just changing the plumbing. Just changing the plumbing has pretty much no positive (likely more negative) effect on usability. E.g. (just "let's use jekyll for that")
* Just replace the editing UI / wiki mark-up/down syntax. E.g. the "simple web interface" benefit of jekyll is actually more complicated than the current wiki which is also a web interface. I.e. if all you're doing is replacing wiki markup with markdown, it's not a benefit. mediawiki: wiki syntax + mediawiki templates. jekyll: markdown + yaml blocks and includes. they're not actually that different.
* "learning one more system" = worse overall UX.
* Aspirational new system proposed by non-users of current system. The "I won't use the existing system because I hate wikis" argument is not a good argument, as absence of use of a current system provides no evidence that any new system would gain any use at all.

=== Replacement Requirements ===
Capturing here from IRC, some thoughts on possible requirements for any proposals to improve / replace entirety of how we create / update events on the IndieWeb.org site itself.

* '''Maintenance commitment up front.''' Volunteers to build a new system should also consider volunteering to maintain it, otherwise it's just trading one (known) maintenance tax (updating multiple places in the wiki, annoying, but simple/easy that anyone can do it), for another (unknown) maintenance tax (updating/fixing software, likely much harder, means it doesn't get done).
* '''Try and learn current system first.'''  Volunteers to design/build/replace events should at least *try* actively updating / creating events on indieweb.org so that they have some direct first-person understanding of the needs of the community. Without that first-hand knowledge, any such proposal is likely ignorant of the community's actual needs.
* '''Start with UI/UX sketches.''' Anything any of us want to build to replace the wiki events should start out with UI/UX sketches, no code at all.
* '''Support your own indie events first.''' Group events software is so much harder / more complex than indie [[event]] / [[RSVP]] posting support (likely a superset of), that that would make a good prerequisite for any proposals/proposers.

=== Separate Events Site ===
We used 2016.indieweb.org for the [[2016]] IndieWeb Summit. The [http://2016.indieweb.org IndieWeb Summit 2016] event page was an initial attempt at creating a more friendly format for our events. 

We have also set up 2016.indieweb.org/nyc2 for [[2016/NYC2|IndieWebCamp NYC2]].

Possibilities for expanding use of a separate site for events. 
* Continue with YYYY.indieweb.org
* New subdomain events.indieweb.org

==== Some options to consider ====
* keep using YYYY.indieweb.org for annual summits, and YYYY.indieweb.org/CITYABBR for specific IndieWebCamps
* build our own minimal event interface 
* adopt an existing running project such as [[Calagator]] 
* wait for an in-progress project such as [[Dark Matter Eventer]]

==== Requirements ====
(not comprehensive) 
* Some level of unstructured content on event pages, so that we can allow our use of it to continue to evolve over time.
* Be able to quickly duplicate an event rather than set up recurring events (like Calagator's "clone" function)
* Events must support multiple locations and varying start times and timezones per location (our HWC events do this currently)

==== Ideas ====
* Quickly add links to posts (notes, photos, articles) about an event
* Highlight photos from events
** Upload photos directly to the wiki or event page
** By retrieving linked photos in indieweb photo posts / tweets / instagram posts
* RSVP via Webmention like http://2016.indieweb.org
* RSVP directly on the page (an "I'm Going" button after you're logged in)

==== Tickets and Registration ====
For the past couple years, we've had a separate ticketing website for letting people register/buy tickets to the events. We've found that having an explicit step of acquiring the ticket leads to better no-show rates. In 2016, the attendance rate of people who RSVPd from their website was 73%, vs that of people who bought a $5 ticket was 39%.

There isn't any value gained by having the registration system outside of the main event page, so integrating them would certainly be a good goal. Here are the features of the registration system that have been useful.

* Accepting payments for tickets.
* Issuing "tickets" in a way that feels stronger than just RSVPing for the event.
* Collecting the person's email address
* Providing a way to contact them before the event, such as sending reminders leading up to the event.

==== Other community examples ====
* WordCamps, which have many properties in common with Indiewebcamps
** Uses wordcamp.org (likely derived from barcamp.org), a TLD different from the community: wordpress.org
*** Philosophy: a main landing page and using subdomains for the individual events, with year/location. 
*** Making wordcamp.org itself the page for upcoming events
*** Use subdomains on wordcamp.org for specific events
*** Issues: they had an issue with [https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/09/29/switching-back-to-the-original-wordcamp-urls/ URL structure] last year.
