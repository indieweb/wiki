'''<dfn>[http://jekyllrb.com/ Jekyll]</dfn>''' is [[Ruby]] software that helps you create "Simple, blog-aware, static sites" suitable for [[web_hosting#Static_domain_hosting|static domain hosting]]. It is simple in sense that it does one thing well. It compiles HTML and markdown files into a static website.

The learning curve is steep for those not used to HTML. However, there is a pattern of people migrating from [[WordPress]] to Jekyll, and many people in [[IRC]] have experience with setting up Jekyll.

It was made popular by [[GitHub]]'s offer to [http://pages.github.com/ build and host your jekyll powered website for free]. While GitHub may be a form of a [[silo]] that can easily host a Jekyll website, Jekyll has no dependence upon GitHub.  Projects like [https://github.com/developmentseed/jekyll-hook jekyll-hook] can help replicate the publishing workflow that GitHub offers on your own server.
