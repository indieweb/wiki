* '''[[#Suggestions|suggestions]]''' / discussion about the indiewebcamp wiki itself.

== Page type ==
{{main|wiki-page}}

In addition to sequential / time-ordered [[posts]], many in the IndieWebCamp community either want to or already host a wiki or wiki pages on their own personal site.

Wiki pages are typically editable and versioned with visible / easily accessible version history & browsable versions. Wiki pages are often also multi-authored and have a multi-platform interface (like any web-based content hosting solution).

* [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] has his own wiki at http://wiki.tommorris.org/
* [[User:caseorganic.com|Amber Case]] has her own wiki at http://caseorganic.com/wiki/

There are also various wiki hosting sites / [[silos]].

== Uploading by Email ==
You can upload files to this wiki via email, which is often easier to do on a phone than sign in to the wiki and use the MediaWiki interface.

Send a file attachment to <code>upload@indiewebcamp.com</code>. Any text in the body of your email will be added as the description of the photo. The subject line is ignored. You will get an email response after the wiki processes the photo, but you might need to check your spam folder for the reply.
