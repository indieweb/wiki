'''<dfn>[http://blogger.com/ Blogger]</dfn>''' is a blog content hosting [[silo]] owned by [[Google]]. 

"Blogger" used to be the name of (one of?) the first blogging application services ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service SaaS]) that used your own domain and your own [[hosting]] provider for the storage of your blog, and FTP as an API to edit your site. If the Blogger application went down, your site still worked (to serve your posts) - the only thing you couldn't do was use the application to edit or publish new posts. In this way, the original Blogger was quite an IndieWeb-enabling tool - you still fully owned and controlled your content, as it was all stored on your own web host.

Google shutdown the Blogger application on 2010-05-01.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_%28service%29]

The Blogger team created "Blogspot.com" as a hosted version ([[silo]]) of the Blogger application, which was later served from blogger.com and then renamed to "Blogger", thus replacing the original meaning and web application functionality with a [[silo]].
__TOC__
== Domain Hosting ==
It is possible to setup Blogger to serve your blog on your own domain for free to [[get started]] on the IndieWeb.

=== Issues ===
Issues folks have run into with Blogger's custom domain support.

* Blogger defaults to dynamic templates, which create pages without HTML content (they are dynamically generated by [[JavaScript]] API calls). Example: lizasperling.com (fetching lizasperling.com?m=1 will get the mobile version, which does contain HTML).
* Blogger adds a rel="me" link to your Google+ profile URL, but it uses the long form (21 digit number), not the human readable name, thus confusing IndieAuth.

== webmention ==
Blogger doesn't have built in support for [[webmention]]s, but [[Bridgy]] can send, receive, and display webmentions for Blogger blogs. You can also receive webmentions with [[webmention.io]] and [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com].

== Users own their content ==
[http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/ Google's TOS] ([https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/41935?hl=en&ref_topic=12467 which cover Blogger directly]; checked 2014-07-21) assert that users retain ownership and copyright over all content and intellectual property they post. From
[http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/#toc-content Your Content in Our Services]:

<blockquote>
Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
</blockquote>

== Data Export ==
Theoretically [[Google]] Takeout should have a way to export your Blogger blog, however the export format is unknown. Other options:

== Micropub ==
It is possible to use [[Micropub]] clients like Quill to post to Blogger sites using [[Feverdream]] as a bridge.

== PubSubHubbub ==

Uses [[PubSubHubbub]] to publish Atom feeds since [http://buzz.blogger.com/2009/08/blogger-joins-hubbub.html 2009-08-17]

== Criticism ==
=== templates use XML ===
Blogger templates still require use of their custom XML, which has inconveniences like:
<blockquote>blogger templates are still xml, so I have to CDATA escape the javascript ... [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-04-18/line/1397880406]</blockquote>
