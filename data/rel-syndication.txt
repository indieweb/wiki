'''<dfn>rel-syndication</dfn>''' is a way to discoverably link from your original blog post permalinks to syndicated copies of it on other sites, e.g. [[silos]].

== Why ==
<div id="Use_cases">{{main|syndication-link-use-cases}}</div>

Why should an original post visibly hyperlink to syndicated copies? 

=== POSSE threading ===
It enables those that that reply to your posts and POSSE similarly, to thread their POSSE replies to your POSSE copies.

If an Indie Web site supports POSSEing to one or more [[silo]] destinations, it should:
* do rel-syndication discovery on the original [[in-reply-to]] URL
* for each such POSSE destination:
** choose the first rel-syndication link that goes to that destination and save it
* when POSSEing the [[reply]] post to each POSSE destination:
** if a rel-syndication link was found for it
*** be sure to thread the POSSE copy of the reply as a reply to the respective rel-syndication link

=== More use cases ===

== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
An original post <em>should</em> <span id="Publishing">hyperlink</span> to syndicated copies (e.g. per [[POSSE]]) with a rel value of <code>syndication</code>.

Additionally the [[microformats2]] class name <code>u-syndication</code> should also be placed on such hyperlinks from original posts (inside their [[h-entry]] markup/object) to their syndicated copies.

See the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-syndication rel-syndication specification] for more details.

=== How to link to Twitter ===
When <span id="Linking_to_Twitter.com">linking to</span> [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSEd copies of posts on twitter.com]], make sure the link scheme is <code>https://</code> for [[original-post-discovery]] as Twitter.com redirects to https.

=== How to link from WordPress ===
Install this plugin:
* {{GWG}}'s [https://github.com/dshanske/syndication-links Syndication Links] plugin. He took the functionality of the "WordPress Syndication" plugin below and merge it into this one so two things don't need to be maintained. This code is now being moved into the Indieweb Plugin. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-15/line/1424035276195]

Unmaintained[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-15/line/1424035736201] and causes unknown error[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-15/line/1424035710146]:
* [[User:Jihais.se]]'s [https://wordpress.org/plugins/relsyndication/ rel-syndication] plugin. Integrates with other POSSE plugins; currently just [http://wordpress.org/plugins/social/ Mailchimp Social].
* [[User:Jihais.se]]'s [https://github.com/jihaisse/wordpress-syndication WordPress Syndication] plugin is the github for the same plugin[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-15/line/1424035956122].

=== How to use ===
An Indie Web site that supports the ability to [[reply]] to [[posts]] should allow you to reply to any URL. As part of that reply UI, it should do <span id="Discovery">rel-syndication discovery</span> for the [[POSSE]] threading use case described above by following this algorithm:

rel-syndication discovery algorithm:
# load the [[in-reply-to]] URL as a document
# collect all the [[rel-syndication]] <code>link href</code> and <code>a href</code> URLs.
# if none are found,
## parse the document for [[microformats2]]
## if there's a top level [[h-entry]]
## then collect all of its <code>syndication</code> property values 
# end if
# return whatever was collected

Any algorithm that has the same result as this algorithm may be used. E.g. as part of step 2 your code could parse the entire document simultaneously for <em>both</em> <code>rel</code> values and [[h-entry]] microformats rather than the separate parsing step in 3.1.
