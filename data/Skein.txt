The microformats library used by Skein has been released as a separate module on NPM, and is more suitable for general use:

== Architecture ==

Skein uses [[PURR]] to use published HTML as its native data store. Earlier in development, sqlite was used as a cache, but it was abandoned due to issues getting out of sync with published content. See [[database-antipattern]]. The oauth endpoint issues stateless [[JWT]] tokens.

The server process hosts micropub and webmention endpoints, and is designed to run an an EC2 instance. On receiving a webmention or new post, content is regenerated and published to S3.

The publishing layer is modular, and S3 can be switched out for git or static file hosting backends. The static file backend is used to run an end-to-end test suite.
