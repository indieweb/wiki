== Venue ==

[[File:the-skiff-entrance.jpg|thumb|alt=The glass entrance door to The Skiff. Beside it is a lamp post.|There are several entrances to the building, but only this one leads to The Skiff! The one you want is on Blackman Street. Buzz #7, head up the stairs, and it's on the right.]]

The Skiff had a total capacity of 30. On most days it is a busy and popular co-working space, so there were plenty of power sockets and cabling to ensure the space can flex to meet our needs.

There were a few breakout spaces we could use, including a small meeting room and a kitchen area with seating. The main event area could be divided into to two, but instead we gathered around a long table in front of a projector screen.

One small room was reserved for members of the co-working space who wanted to use it while we were there, but nobody used it during the weekend.

The Skiff is situated on the first floor of the building, but '''has no lift and was therefore inaccessible'''.
