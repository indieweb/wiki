__TOC__
== Venue ==
The Skiff has a total capacity of 30. Depending on interest, we may need to have a ticketing system in place to manage numbers.

=== Accessibility ===
The Skiff is situated on the first floor of the building, but has no lift and is therefore inaccessible.

* 2024-01-22 {{paulrobertlloyd}} has been contacted about an alternative venue which, while accessible, doesn’t have break out spaces. Going to find out more this week and decide if we can or want to switch.
