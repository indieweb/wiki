== Venue ==

[[File:the-skiff-entrance.jpg|thumb|alt=The glass entrance door to The Skiff. Beside it is a lamp post.|There are several entrances to the building, but only this one leads to The Skiff! The one you want is on Blackman Street. Buzz #7, head up the stairs, and it's on the right.]]

The Skiff has a total capacity of 30. On most days it is a busy and popular co-working space, so there are plenty of power sockets and cabling to ensure the space can flex to meet our needs.

There are a few breakout spaces we can use, including a small meeting room and a kitchen area with seating. The main event area can also be divided into to two. One small room will be reserved for members of the co-working space who want to use it while we're there.

=== Accessibility ===

The Skiff is situated on the first floor of the building, but '''has no lift and is therefore inaccessible'''.

If you have specific accessibility requirements, contact us in advance and weâ€™ll try to make sure that we are able to accommodate you.

== Health and Safety ==

In order to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all, if you are feeling unwell, or are experiencing any respiratory symptoms â€“Â COVID-19, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), flu, cold, etc. â€“ we request that you participate remotely.

In the 4-5 days before IndieWebCamp, try to avoid any situations that may risk exposure to contagious diseases, and consider wearing a high quality mask (N95, KN95, or similar rating) if you visit a hospital, pharmacy or doctorâ€™s surgery.

The venue is provisioned with vertically oriented fresh air ventilation throughout, and if the weather is nice we can open some windows too.
