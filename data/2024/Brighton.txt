== Venue ==

The Skiff has a total capacity of 30. On most days it is a busy and popular co-working space, so there are plenty of power sockets and cabling to ensure the space can flex to meet our needs.

There are a few breakout spaces we can use, including a small meeting room and a kitchen area with seating. The main event area can also be divided into to two.

=== Accessibility ===

The Skiff is situated on the first floor of the building, but has no lift and is therefore inaccessible.

* 2024-01-31 â€“Â {{paulrobertlloyd}} is in discussions about alternative venues that have ground floor access.

== Schedule ==

* '''Day 1''' is about discussing in a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp BarCamp]-like environment. Bring a topic youâ€™d like to discuss or join in on topics as they are added to the board.

* '''Day 2''' is about making things! Direct your inspiration from what we discussed day 1 into something on your site. Work with others or on your own. Weâ€™ll have demos at the end of the day to see what everyone worked on!
