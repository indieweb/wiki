IndieWebCamp Portland will be following the [[XOXO]] 2024 COVID policy:
* https://xoxofest.com/guide/covid/

Updates: similar to the XOXO 2024 COVID policy, this COVID policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of our COVID policy between now and IndieWebCamp Portland 2024.
