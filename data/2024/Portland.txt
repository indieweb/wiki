Updates: similar to the XOXO 2024 COVID policy, this COVID policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of our COVID policy between now and IndieWebCamp Portland 2024.

* Wiki page creating / editing (for all the usual pages we make for an IndieWebCamp)
* Getting the word out to XOXO participants and getting RSVPs on the Event link
