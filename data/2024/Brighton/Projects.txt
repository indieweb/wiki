{{alex}} Goals:

Get rid of as many blog post drafts as possible, preferably by publishing them.
* introduction to LGBT+ topics for my right-wing mom (the doc exists, it's long, the idea is to make an online guide with it)
* my problem wasn't twitter and the answer isn't mastodon − tldr dopamine is nice but social media is not great
* the importance of having a style guide for your organization
* i'm queer and i don't use instagram, leave me alone
* an intro to the web search engine kagi 
* being on the WMFR board of trustees − goal is for people to know what to expect and encourage them to apply for next year's election
* an opinionated history of satisfaction surveys − before i murder the next designer who asks me to rate something out of 5 stars
* intro to creative commons licenses
* freedom and decentralization: why web2 and web3 use them so differently
* my mugs and their history, inspired by james' 100 new ideas for your blog
* a web project is finished! omg! − on how projects never seem to end (based on Mobilizon, & possibly Ethereum)
* Write a blog post about webmentions (after I inadvertently prompted lots of people to share interesting thoughts with my « webmentions make me sad » post)
 
=== David Shanske ===

* Wants to set up a mailing list server to experiment with bringing back my mailing list, only self-hosted instead of a service...well, the mail server will still be a service, but want to try to play with the code to interface with it.
