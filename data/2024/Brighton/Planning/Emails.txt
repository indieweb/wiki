<pre>Hi {{first_name}},

Wow, last weekend was amazing! Thank-you so much for taking the time to join us, we hoped you got as much from the event as we did.

Here‚Äôs a quick recap of the weekend‚Äôs events.

## Saturday sessions

![Group photo of everyone at day 1 of IndieWebCamp Brighton 2024](https://indieweb.org/images/6/63/iwc-brighton-2024-saturday-photo.jpg)

On Saturday, we organised sessions around a number of topics people were interested in.

Discussions ranged from [syndicating posts](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/posse) and then displaying [comments](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/comments) about them (trusty ol‚Äô email being an undervalued option), [hosting](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/hosting) websites and more so [pictures](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/pictures) (possible for only 4¬¢/month!), [accessibility](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/a11y) (and how to [test](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/testing) for it), considering the [environmental impact](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/energy-efficiency) of our work, writing (or should that be gardening?) as well as some group therapy around personal website [pain points](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/pains) and being wowed by [NFC](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/nfc). And of course, finally, [death](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/site-death)!

Notes for all of the sessions are linked from [the Schedule page](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/Schedule); please feel free to review notes and update them if you were in a session and want to add some additional links or context.

## Sunday hacking

On Sunday, we got our hands dirty and started experimenting and trying out some of the ideas we discussed the day before. Websites were launched!

[Notes about all the demos were taken](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/Demos) ‚Äì¬†thanks James. Again, please feel free to update these if you have anything you wish to add or correct about the work you did on the day.
