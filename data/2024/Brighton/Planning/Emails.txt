<pre>Hi {{ first_name }},

We’re looking forward to seeing you at [IndieWebCamp Brighton](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton) – hard to believe it’s just 10 days away!

Here are a few things you can do to get ready and make the most of your time at IndieWebCamp:

- join the IndieWebCamp [chat](https://chat.indieweb.org/) or [Slack](http://slack.indiewebcamp.com/) and introduce yourself!
- [add yourself to the IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org/wikifying) with additional info about yourself, such as what projects you’re working on, etc.
- attend an online [Homebrew Website Club](https://indiewebcamp.com/next-hwc) meet-up this evening.

We’ll be in touch again next week with any last minute notes.

See you soon,
