@lazcorp's post on this subject - https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/complex-images

There is no limit of the length of 'alt' attribute text, but an overlong description is not appropriate. So for Complex Images you should also include a text description elsewhere in the HTML of the page.

Aria Descriptions for sections of a page - where should they go?
* Perhaps in a Table of Contents at the top?

HTML5 Landmarks - hardly used in practice

Accessibility testing tools:
* Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights - https://pagespeed.web.dev/
* Polypane - dev browser - https://polypane.app/
* HTML Code Sniffer - https://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/
* Pa11y - https://pa11y.org/
* Axe - https://www.deque.com/axe/
