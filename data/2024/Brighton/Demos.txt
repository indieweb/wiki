'''<dfn>2024/Brighton/Demos</dfn>''' was a session at the end of day 2 of [[2024/Brighton|IndieWebCamp Brighton 2024]] where participants took turns demonstrating and talking through what they did, made, created on or using their personal website or for the community.

== Demos ==

===  Chris Newton ===

* Uses Markdown on posts
* MDN says that [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#the_title_attribute titles on images are harmful] because of issues with touch devices, keyboard navigation, screen readers, etc.
* Updated Markdown parsing logic with a tool called Unify.js that lets him change the structure of the Markdown. Already being used for image optimization. Updated how content is rendered so that the img w/ title is now a figure with figcaption.
* Documented Unify.js plugin in a blog post that describes how his tool works.
* You can use utilities with Unify.js to do things like use CSS selectors to select images.
** Then you can use hashscript to build new object sin the syntax tree.
** Creates figure element, puts image inside it, creates figcaption, adds text in caption. Replaces default content in the tree with the resulting code.
* Conclusion: Adds captions to images.

=== {{scoutaloud}} ===

** It has a domain name!
* Set up S3 bucket for website
** Started setting up CloudFront account for personal website, takes time, reading, and learning

** All one page, no JS
** Interactive game where you can click links to navigate to different pages

** Every block of text is a <code>div</code> with an id and CSS is used to show and hide sections.

** Almost has all different parts of the API from which data is taken working, doesn't have geolocation working from reviews
** There is a type attribute (i.e. cocktail)
** Shows star rating
** Q: Does it use h-review? Has not used h-review. Uses h-entry.

=== {{roobottom}} ===

* Spent time on private posts
* Restyled articles
** Chosen favourite articles that are promoted
** Spent a lot of time getting the first published dates on articles; moving into digital gardens paradigms.
* Wrote [https://roobottom.com/articles/plugging-into-the-indieweb/ a blog post] — took 15 minutes. Mainly thanks to digital garden concept of publishing then knowing you can edit.
* Excited about building things for his website.

=== {{francescofigari}} ===

* Page works well when you dynamically resize
* Menu changes size when you resize the page

=== {{capjamesg}} ===

I did a few things: firstly wrote a blog post on [https://jamesg.blog/2024/03/10/100-more-personal-website-ideas/] 100 more things you can do on your website'. Actually 100 items this time. recommend making a quiz! (e.g. favourite cheese, anime hair). Actually it's not 100 things! Close enough to 100.

Other thing: past few weeks the website has had a penguin in background. Press 'p' to show the penguin, press WASD to move it, when it gets close to a hyperlink it'll open the page. Just a fun way to navigate around my site.

And another thing: every blog post now has a related Taylor Swift lyric. I underestimated how long it'd take, but it's almost done. 

=== {{samboyer}} ===

* Released new blog
* Created old-fashioned menu
* Not actually an Apache index, but looks like one. Made with CSS. Hosted on GitHub Pages. Uses jinja2 templates.
* Subdirectories instead of tags.
* There is an RSS feed, made as a jinja2 template.
* Added syntax highlighting to blog posts, thanks to pandoc, which is used to generate blog posts from markdown.

=== Andy ===

* Thinking about digital gardens.
* Used Drupal to make one.
* Interested in planted and last tended ontologies, explored that on personal website.

=== {{jkphl}} ===

* Spent most of the day analyzing the structure of his old website
* Created a flow chart with all the pieces
* Identified pieces that he wants to keep and dismiss for the time being
* For example, there were events and projects on my old website; events were h-events and RSVPs to IWCs and HWCs. All past events. Not planning to publish more. Going to drop these. Will drop open source projects that are unmaintained or have been hadned over to other people.
* Wants to keep articles, doesn't want to break any URLs. Webmention has been broken for a few years.
* Will be new things on website. Slides from talks. Were already there but not discoverable.
* Going to make a static website, plans to create a website from an ASCII Doc document. Going to transform older documents into ASCII Doc documents.
* Tried to simulate all the things he would need for blog posts; basically text and images. Found embeded YouTube videos. ASCII doc has provisions for this. Made example document with an example of how content would look. ASCII doc produces proper HTML; not perfect, so some transformations will be needed.
* This is what I planned today, plans to continue in Düsseldorf.

=== {{t}} ===

* Wiki gardened IWC Brighton session pages!
** Thanks to gRegor for archiving session Etherpads to the wiki!
** gRegor gave a caveat that he didn't have time to fix markdownlinks, so as first project I went through archived Etherpads and aimed to clean up links.
** convert markdown links to MediaWiki links
** convert indieweb.org (and some services) links to local wiki page links
** fixed (some) typos
** permalink to edits: https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&target=Tantek.com&namespace=all&start=2024-03-10&end=2024-03-10&limit=50
* Blogged about last Sunday @-mention and @-@-mention autolinking coding improvements on my site
** https://tantek.com/2024/070/t1/updated-auto-linking-mention-use-cases
** Jeremy mentioned the issue at IWC Nüremberg, documented for later reference.
** Code is open source on website, not on GitHub yet; testing in production.
