'''<dfn>2024 homepage</dfn>''' is a small project to update the homepage so that it works with both MediaWiki skins (aka themes, Vector-2022 and Vector-2010) that users can choose from. By supporting both skins, it will then be possible to change the default skin to the newer of the two, which has a mobile layout and other UX refinements.

== Why Update the Homepage ==

The site’s MediaWiki installation provides the following skins: 

* [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector Vector legacy (2010)]
* [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector/2022 Vector (2022)]

The site currently uses the Vector legacy (2010) skin, with customisations to the homepage. These make the homepage more visually appealing and also remove some UI elements to make it work on mobile. These customisations don’t work with the newer skin, so switching it to it breaks the homepage.

The new Vector (2022) skin is the one used by default on English Wikipedia, meaning it is familiar to many. It includes improvements to the mobile layout and reading experience, and incorporates changes developed over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Deployment_of_Vector_(2022)/More_about_Vector_(2022) several rounds of prototyping, design and testing].

The primary goal of any initial redesign to the homepage in 2024 is to enable switching over to the new theme for signed-out users, and making it usable for signed-in users who have chosen to use it.

== Homepage Redesign Proposal ==

On 2024-01-19, {{paulrobertlloyd}} proposed an update that:

* Keeps the existing content and sections, but merges the 2 pieces of content that provide a summary of what the IndieWeb is, and shows them at the top of the page.
* Reduces the size of ‘What is the IndieWeb’ heading (but keeping it for SEO), and increases the font size of the answer below it. This provides a lead in to the rest of the page.
* Updates the three concept icons to use updated icons which use MediaWiki image templates.
* Adjusts the background colours to use pastel variants of the [[Indieweb_color_palette|IndieWeb color palette]], with each section colour taken from the emoji used in its heading.
* Adds space between each section to make the design complement the layout when the Main menu sidebar is shown.

In addition to homepage updates, {{paulrobertlloyd}} proposes making slight changes to the Vector 2022 theme so that the site:

* uses a larger type size for body text (16px instead of 14px), making content more legible and less intimidating
* feels complementary to [https://events.indieweb.org events.indieweb.org]
* looks distinct from Wikipedia
