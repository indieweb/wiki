'''<dfn>2024 homepage</dfn>''' is a small project to update the homepage so that it works with both MediaWiki skins (aka themes, Vector-2022 and Vector-2010) that users can choose from. By supporting both skins, it will then be possible to change the default skin to the newer of the two, which has improved mobile layout and other UX refinements.

== Why Update the Homepage ==

The site’s MediaWiki installation provides the following skins: 

* [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector Vector legacy (2010)]
* [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector/2022 Vector (2022)]

The site currently uses the Vector legacy (2010) skin, with homepage customisations that remove some UI elements. Switching to the newer theme breaks the homepage.

The new Vector (2022) skin is the one used by default on English Wikipedia, meaning it is familiar to many. It includes improvements to the mobile layout and reading experience, and incorporates changes developed over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Deployment_of_Vector_(2022)/More_about_Vector_(2022) several rounds of prototyping, design and testing].

The primary goal of any initial redesign to the homepage is to enable us to switch over to using the new theme for signed-out users, and usable for signed-in users who have chosen to use it.

== Homepage Redesign Proposal ==

On 2024-01-19, {{paulrobertlloyd}} proposed an update that:

* Keeps the existing content and sections, but merging the 2 pieces of content that provide a summary of what the IndieWeb is, and showing that in the top section.
* Reduces the size of ‘What is the IndieWeb’ (but keeping it for SEO), and increasing the font size of the answer below it. This provides a lead in to the rest of the page content.
* Updates the three concept icons to use updated icons and use MediaWiki image templates.
* Adjusts the background colours to use pastel variants of the [[IndieWeb color palette]], which is section colour taken from the emoji is used in the heading for each section.
* Adds space between each section, to make the layout complement an open Main menu sidebar when shown.

Screenshots TBD

In addition to homepage updates, {{paulrobertlloyd}} proposed making some slight changes to the Vector 2022 theme so that the site:

* looks distinct from Wikipedia
* feels complementary to [https://events.indieweb.org events.indieweb.org]
* uses a larger type size for body text (16px instead of 14px), making content more legible and less intimidating

Screenshots TBD
