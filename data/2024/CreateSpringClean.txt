With spring on the horizon, we are coming together to give our websites a spring clean.

Do you have design updates you have wanted to make for a while but haven't gotten around to? Is there a blog post you have been meaning to tidy up? Do you have some code you need to remove or refactor? Do you have ideas to work on in the future that you want to start working on now?

If the answer to any of these questions is "yes", or you have other spring cleaning to do on your website, join us!

== Schedule ==

Organizer of the Zoom: {{GWG}} + {{capjamesg}}

* 9AM Pacific: We will open the Zoom at 9AM Pacific Time, or earlier for anyone who wishes it on another timezone. At 9AM, we will have introductions and, optionally site demos. We will ask participants to share what they want to work on with those in attendance before we get down to work.
* Noon-1PM Pacific: Bring Your Own Lunch and Touch Base with the Other Attendees
* 4PM-5PM: Optionally Demo What You Built

After that, there is no expectation that you stay the whole day...pop in and out as you wish.

== Chat ==

All text-based chatting is done in the IndieWeb chat. Feel free to join us there to get realtime updates and conversation during the event. There are many ways to join. Click here to pick one.

== Brainstorming Dates ==

* Any Saturday in February / early March? - {{capjamesg}}
