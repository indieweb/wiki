== Demos ==
Started at 17:00 Pacific

=== Tantek ===
demonstrated:
* converting https://foursquare.com/t/list/berlin-cafes--takeout to a plain text version on his site: https://tantek.com/berlin 
* copy edits on IndieWebify.me: contributed to the IndieWebify community site by copy editing wording to make it less intimidating and more welcoming, based in feedback received during the camp by a first time IndieWebify user! https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/pull/124

=== Gregor ===
* ...
* made a list of food and drink places with headings by city: https://gregorlove.com/lists/food-and-drink/ 

=== Chris Aldrich ===
* Posted his IWC SD 2024 Project goals, typing them out: https://boffosocko.com/2024/12/08/indiewebcamp-san-diego-2024-project-goals/
* tweaked a few things in terms of alt text

=== Joe ===
* Set up a minimal spoiler element with a <label> element and a checkbox
* Full-screen view of his checkins was broken, discovered late last night. Updated so it's more compact.
* Not usually chcking in realtime, will occasionally go back and Swarm suggests checkins based on location history.
* Exports checkins periodically (not during htis camp, though)
* Shows a Strava post embedded in his blog post (using iframe)
* Didn't get to revamping his page where you can add a sticky note, wants to modernize it, making something interesting of it.

=== ilovecomputer ===
* https://ilove.computer
* Added h-card to his homepage
* Joe demonstrated verifying it on indiewebify.me

=== Angelo (remote) ===
* Showing a page created in April of a hike to Muir Peak
* Used [[Overland]] to ping GPS coordinates of hike
* Narrowed the data to just the hike, left with the map and markers and some photos that he manually placed on there
* Today: worked on further exposing that data, photos full res, a video, and a data table. Overland gives some standard diagnostics like battery life, coordinates, altitude (ft), m/s. Timestamps get wonky at some point but rest of data looks correct.
* If you click on a coordinate in the table, adds a marker on the map
* Future steps: maybe put photos in the timeline of events; 

=== Al Abut ===
* Analog for now
* Did a creativity exercise with several attendees
* Took a page, break into four quadrants, give a time limit of 5 minutes, and sketch UIs, no words
* Helped him understand some things and get some inspiration
* Al is sharing analog drawings, which will be digitized
* After the drawing, talked through each one since they don't really make sense without explanation
* Ulterior motive: if he understands concepts well enough, can make some wireframes. Some of these might have W3C specs in motion like geodata

=== David Shanske ===
* https://david.shanske.com
* Tested a few different types of posts he hasn't in a while, like reviews
* Cleaned up some icons
* Review of Berkshire Motel. 4 stars is satisfied.
* "Obligated to write a post about a burrito experience"
* Also wrote about switching to ClassicPress
* Syndication Icons build process improved
* Cleaned up some duplicate post locations
* Restored reviews to the main feed
