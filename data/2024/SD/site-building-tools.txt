=== {{peterkaminski}} ===
* Example of Massive Wiki static site -> https://ai101.peterkaminski.wiki
** Use Obsidian + Obsidian git plugin as an editor for Markdown
** "Obsidian is a really simple IDE for Markdown files."
* Netlify toml file will publish massive wiki as static site

Using LLMs to write code and make websites
* "Jankifiers" -> https://ai101.peterkaminski.wiki/jankifiers
* Claude works well for developing front-end with React and Tailwind

* Work with o1 model to write specs
* Ask for feedback on the specs
* Ask for LLM to write a new spec based on improvements / conversations
* Ask for LLM to build based on the spec
* Tip: Big input context, small output context ( 128k vs 8k )
** Go a head and send non-human sized input for review
** Ask for additional detail on output ( e.g. "Make complete output files" )
** Ask for it to "continue" if it hits a limit on output
* Tip: LLMs are stateless and will re-read all of the input on each new request

== Tools ==
* Massive Wiki Builder - build & deploy static HTML site from markdown wiki files
** https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massivewikibuilder
* Obsidian
* Claude
* Netlify, Vercel
* Glitch
