* Instagram

== Notes ==
Use-case: conversation around what I'm saying

* {{gwg}}: I want to be productive, and people engaging with what I'm doing makes me more productive.
** Would like to avoid the LiveJournal backfill auto-syndication of all backfilled posts live publicly which some were supposed to be private.

* {{aciccarello}} Using Bridgy Fed for Mastodon and Bluesky
** Great for replying to mastodon posts
** Have defaults for if different post types show up in a main feed but can be overriden
** Reviews generally aren't in the main feed but some might be able to stand on their own
** {{ilovecomputers}} you'll run into issues if you rename yourself to your domain: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1074

* {{t}} strava has options to "mute" activity in the main/group feeds
* {{gwg}} Micro.blog doesn't support all post types so you might not want to syndicate
** {{gRegor}} Micro.blog is fairly forgiving
** Mastodon also has limitations about what post types are supported
** Can control syndication per post type
** {{t}} but even still, most platforms still support a plaintext version

* {{gwg}}: use-case: inviting more conversation

* {{gwg}}: I want people to see and find my stuff
* {{t}}: is this for people to see real-time, like in a reader/newsfeed, or to find eventually or ever, like from a web search?
* {{gwg}}: both. anything within the week for me is somewhat real time. also had an example where someone found a post from years ago and commented on it.

* {{gRegor}} Goodreads reviews have a checkbox "Add to update feed" which is checked by default. If checked, review will show up on your profile page.

* {{aciccarello}} have seen that where someone mentions something of mine in their weekly round-up
* Most people won't assume they can subscribe to a website via ActivityPub/Mastodon, so making those options clearer can help gain readership
* People like that they can get personal interactions from platforms like Mastodon

* {{aciccarello}} would like to POSSE to Instagram since that's where his family is
