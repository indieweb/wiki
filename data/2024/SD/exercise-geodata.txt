== Background ==
* also interested: {{angelo}},  {{artlung}}
* https://indieweb.org/exercise
* Bringing location and activity data to your website from Strava, Ridewithgps, dawn patrol, etc.
* Apple Maps just added support for planning and using hiking trails

== Notes ==
* Is it useful to distinguish between individual and group activity?!?
* Overlaps with earlier session on venues and locations, with added aspect being activities and routes.
* Might include number and name of participants or groups
* Can be multiple locations.
* Venue data is rating, website 
* This focus is on data related to an activity:
* Data built in
* Elevation data
* Cardio data (ave HR, max HR, zones)
* Power (watts output)
* Routes
* Mileage
* Steps
* Surfing e.g. max speed, time in the water, length in time, distance of ride

* Instagram can capture data about a group - group data
* Cycling, surfing, running, hiking, swimming, walking (steps is the thing most have) 
** Rabbit app generates
** Associated media (photo, proof of life, gym checkin)
** "PR" "Personal record" 
** Have you exported data?
*** {{artlung}} I can't seem to export data, but inferentially I have IG posts where I tagged @Dawnpatrol.app - https://artlung.com/blog/tag/dawnpatrol-app/ which
** {{alabut}} wants to do it manually as an experiment
** https://wandrer.earth/
** Looking at strava maps that show what pathways Mike has taken
** https://www.alltrails.com/ (paid service which locks you out of information about what areas safe from a trail)
* Mike's use case is more about routes and not just exercise data, e.g. when he goes birding.

* "Linestream" LineString - Sets of lat+long points
** GEOS - https://libgeos.org/doxygen/classgeos_1_1geom_1_1LineString.html
