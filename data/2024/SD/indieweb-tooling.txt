IndieWebCamp San Diego 2024<br>
Session: IndieWeb Tooling<br>
When: 2024-12-07 16:50

== Participants ==
* {{angelo}} - facilitating
* {{t}}
* {{gregor}}
* {{ilovecomputers}}
* {{aciccarello}}
* {{gwg}}
* {{angelo}}
* {{addyourself}}

== Background ==
* Indiewebify.me
* Indieweb.rocks
* Protocol branding

== Notes ==
Python setup is hard and a barrier to contribution
* IndieWebify.me is PHP based
* indieweb.rocks is Python

* {{angelo}} stood up indieweb.rocks
* Want to work collaboratively rather than having multiple stagnating projects
* {{artlung}} opened a PR recently to add some tests to Indiewebify.me
* {{gRegor}} has done some partial migrations of the PHP framework off of the existing deprecated one.
** Looking for other people to carry that further
** Right now this is blocking but we could see if we can update to PHP 8 without changing the framework
* There are lots of github issues for new features
* We could refactor some of the templates so that there isn't much logic in the template files
* Indieweb.rocks checked a website for a representative h-card and a few other pieces
** Checked headers for IndieAuth/webmention endpoint

* We do link to a lot of other services
* Could potentially remove features like sending webmentions
* May be hard for someone to pick between a list of external services they don't know
* We could have the UI still in Indiewebify.me but have it call another service like Telegraph

https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82

* We want to be more opinionated than just a microformats parser. validation AND linting.
* Help people understand what a "note" or "bookmark" or "photo" should look like
* {{gregor}} need to push the 20% migrated work-in-progress code he has
