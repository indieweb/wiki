Session: Venue Recommendations<br>
When: 2024-12-07 14:50

== Participants ==
* {{t}} (co-facilitator)
* {{artlung}} (co-facilitator)
* {{aciccarello}}
* {{gwg}}
* {{gRegor}}
* {{addyourself}}

== Background ==
* Where to save your personal lists of interesting (physical) places?
* Where to share locations to share with friends? 
* want my friends to be able to see what I'm sharing without having to login 
* start small and with individual use cases, rather than groups, check-ins, etc.
* replacing Foursquare lists use-cases: https://indieweb.org/2024/SD/project-goals#Foursquare_recommendations_guides
* Do a simple valuable thing to start with and don't let complexity difficulty keep from 

== Notes ==
* Venue Recommendation
* Curated over time
* Also because Foursquare is deprecated
* What are minimum viable use cases?
* When I do multilocation chain
* Disambiguation of a chain (?)
* Do we need a canonical location? 
* Stale data problem (BAB moved and so checking in required an update)
* *I went here* - "I actually went here" has credibility
* I haven't been here but someone I trust recommended it
** First person recommendation
** vs. Second person location
** I have not been but I *want* to get there
** Review aggregation has negative (commercial mostly) incentives
* https://indieweb.org/recommendation

* James says hello from Scotland! Have a terrific IWC! Thx James!
** henlo! -- {{gRegor}} (groan - {{artlung}}, +1 {{t}} ðŸ˜†)

I don't care for "I've heard of"

Please don't parrot Google Search results, that has nearly zero value to me.

My venue recommendations are all places I personally have been to.
E.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20241121191000/https://foursquare.com/t/list/berlin-cafes--takeout

I would also be up for:
* I have not been here but my friend who I trust has been here and says it is good
* I have not been here but it is on my list of places to check out

Perhaps display with different icons and/or colors on a map.
* {{aciccarello}} has [https://www.ciccarello.me/reviews/ some experiments with reviews] and would like to post more structured posts

More examples:
* https://snarfed.org/lists has a few different recommendations
** restaurants example: https://snarfed.org/restaurants
* In 2000 I had this page: https://artlung.com/san-diego-spots/ - which is recommendations for San Diego (it was associated with a dot com domain at the time) but has no markup that's microformatted. 
* Tags can be useful but are difficult to manage (specific vs general location + business types)
* If recommendations are geolocated that could be useful for a search page
* MVP might be a top level page: https://slashpages.net/

Different approaches to a list of recommendations:
* automatically generated venue recommendations page from a set of individual review or similar posts
* manually curated static page â€” this is the one that {{t}} wants

I don't want to build a page "automatically" by making five more problems for me to solve, or to have write a new post every time.

* use case is to share this place with your friends in the shortest way possible FOCUS on MVP
* A simple list page is a great place to start
* More structured content does make it easier to organize (i.e. location data)

I would go more broadly horizontal like from a list of venue recommendations to then a list of movie recommendations
Rather than going deep and building a bunch of building blocks for venue recommendations

* [[Meridian]] is a community made tool for location data based on OpenStreetMaps

* E.g.: https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/813624465475848/burn-all-books/ this is the link,

{{gRegor}} maintains some movie lists, including recommendations: https://gregorlove.com/lists/movies/
* Reviews should be simple to post, could even be a name and a thumb up/down

* Paul Ford's six word reviews of SXSW mp3 files, by jwz: https://www.jwz.org/blog/2008/03/six-word-reviews-of-763-sxsw-mp3s/
https://web.archive.org/web/20080315014728/http%3A//www.themorningnews.org:80/archives/reviews/sixword_reviews_of_763_sxsw_mp3s.php
* Lightweight! Nobody wants to read all that review or read 763 tweets, but a large page to help discovery can work.
** 4578 words (763 songs vs 6 words for) (which is 20 minutes or so to read in total)
Note: despite Twitter being in its heyday in 2008, and being particularly suitable to the short format, Paul Ford DID NOT tweet his six word reviews

* Posting multiple reviews probably shouldn't show up in people's feeds (not great for a time based timeline)
You don't want to spam all your followers with all your reviews

It's not a time-based thing like a checkin.

* {{t}} I like the engeral structure of "places I've been and recommend" and "places I want to visit"
** could apply that to movies also, maybe books

* {{t}} If posting airport recommendations (places in airports), would prefer them all to be one page grouped by airport
** maybe each airport code is a section and heading with a fragment so I can share recommendations for a specific airport as a fragment link within the airports page
* A single page manually written has a lot more flexibility in organization than trying to figure out a tagging structure

Possibly automate generating a table of contents of the headings, at the top of the page
* either backend with PHP that parses the HTML and generates a ToC + original HTML
* or frontend with JS that progressively enhances the HTML page with a ToC at the top
** JS to allow search DOM to easily find things on a page: https://github.com/artlung/lab.artlung.com/blob/master/pages/2025.js
