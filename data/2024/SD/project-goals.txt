=== Foursquare recommendations guides ===
* {{t}}: anything to do with local city recommendations and guides especially for dining, diners, coffee like some of use [[Foursquare]] lists for, and want to move to our own sites, given the impending shutdown of some Foursquare apps, site features: https://foursquare.com/city-guide-sunset/
** Note: 2024-12-15 shutdown of Foursquare native mobile (iOS/Android) app
** Note: 2025-01? shutdown of Foursquare City Guide on the Web <blockquote>â€¦accessible until early 2025, with an exact date to come. We will keep you notified in advance of any changes.</blockquote>
* {{gRegor}}: inspiired by [[2024/SD/venue-recommendations]] session, I think I will set up a simple static HTML page using heading tags for different regions/granularity (e.g. SoCal / San Diego / specific SD neighborhoods) and try to automatically create TOC links at the top of the page
* {{gwg}} wants to start complete several little tweaks to his site, including pre checking Syndication targets, and improving some visual elements.

** [[File:IndieWebCamp_San_Diego_Project_Goals.jpg|center|alt=Typed Index card that reads: IndieWeb Camp San Diego 2024 Project Goals   I missed the first day of camp due to a family ob-ligation. But with Sunday free, I've driven down to San Diego from Los Angeles to participate in create day. Naturally, I've brought a couple of typewriters to continue on with my project from last year: Improving my posting work flow for typecasting (i.e. posting to my website by using the User Interface of a typewriter.) Since I've been doing more work via typewriter, improving this workflow will be a nice feature to have. Let's see how this goes.]]

** Went through the [https://indiewebify.me IndieWebify.me] tutorial and was able to setup my [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain|Web Sign In]], [[wikifying#Why_Join_the_IndieWeb_Wiki|Wikify]] myself, and create my [[h-card]]. Thank y'all for helping me through this process as there definitely were pitfalls as a newcomer. I think it'll be beneficial to perform some user research on other newcomers to the IndieWeb to see how their onboarding experience is like and how it can be improved.
