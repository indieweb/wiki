== Notes ==
* Inspiration for today's session: an old school web project called the Million Dollar Website, where people could claim a pixel at a time to build a large digital quilt.
* What is a modern and indieweb version of something collaborative that we could build like that with interesting emergent patterns?
* Joe's experiment of a node-based interface: https://lab.artlung.com/ArtLung-Notes/v2/
* "Million checkboxes" - https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/ & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Checkboxes
* "How do you make a website more of a happening?" E.g. Angelo's experiments that are super real time.
* Community barn-raising
* Exquisite Corpse - a collaborative game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse
* Passing The Musical Baton: https://artlung.com/blog/2005/05/18/passing-the-musical-baton/ (example posts round robin)
* Reddit r/place - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place
* Collaboratively build a font? 
* Ice bucket challenge
* "Here's 5 lies and a truth? 
* COMMUNITY PLAY
* Where's the fun? And sense of experimentation and play.
* Moderation becomes important for most audiences / curation / avoiding trolling / "griefing" / spamming
* Realtime or async - maybe both
* Mentioned earlier , want to "go where the people are".  Leads to some level of real-time presence
* Does pokemon go count?
* Mike: early Wikipedia had a sense of homesteading that felt like a million pixel quilt.
* Chatroulette as prior art - but it can go bad too
* It can be real time or async.
* Shared presence, shared reality
* Recreating Star Wars in any way https://www.starwarsuncut.com/
** https://racertrash.com/ does this and people take "segs"
* IndieWeb Carnival, writing prompts, film clubs.
* Lots of overlap with the zine creation events at our venue (burn all books, a volunteer-driven spinout from verbatim books)
* A little bit of chaos is a feature not a bug
* What about a timeline sparklines kind of graph like on github profiles? A concise visual representation across a group of websites, e.g. here's the posts by a group of surfers.

* Interfaces for community play = writing topic by the million checkbox guy.
