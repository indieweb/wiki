{{emojicon|üò∑}}
In order to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all, if you are feeling unwell, or have any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, we require that you participate remotely.

'''Before the camp''', we recommend:
* get fully vaccinated for COVID-19, including if possible the updated Fall 2024 booster
* bring KN95/FFP2, N95, or equivalently rated mask/respirator that you‚Äôre comfortable wearing in meeting rooms
* take a Covid test before travel. we require remote-only participation if positive
* contact the [[#Organizers]] with any specific concerns / desires with respect to Health and Safety

4-5 days beforehand (i.e. from November 5-9) please consider avoiding any situations that may risk exposure to contagious diseases, or at least wear a N95 or KN95 mask if you must enter such a situation (e.g. going to a hospital, pharmacy, on taking transit of any sort).

'''En route''' to Berlin and the camp:
* If you are flying or taking a train to the IndieWebCamp to participate in person, please consider:
** In airports or stations: wear a N95 or KN95 mask at all times, except for any identity checks
** On the plane or train: wear a N95 or KN95 mask at all times, except to briefly pull it down to take a sip of water/liquids.

'''Daily at the camp''', there will be good air circulation in the venue. In addition:
* if you are feeling unwell, or have any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, you must participate remotely (not in-person)
* the venue recommends but does not require masking indoors
* our room tables and chairs layout will permit sitting at 2m/6' distance if you prefer
* recommend masking when indoors, and only removing a mask to take a sip from a drink
* recommend eating only in the break area outside the meeting rooms, or outside the building
* speakers at the podium (e.g. when demonstrating) may remove their masks while speaking

'''Updates:''' similar to the [[2024/Portland|IndieWebCamp Portland]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Berlin 2024.
