'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Berlin 2024</dfn>''' is the '''eighth IndieWebCamp in [[Berlin]]''' and scheduled for 2024-11-09…10 the weekend after [[btconf]] [[Berlin]] 2024.

🗓 https://events.indieweb.org/2024/11/indiewebcamp-berlin-2024-XkH8P6vkmYNr

== Summary ==
IndieWebCamp Berlin is an '''all-levels''' BarCamp-like collaboration in Berlin for '''two days''' of keynotes, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping '''gain more control over our data and lives online'''!

Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and – maybe more importantly – encourage all users to own their own content and identities.

Bring your laptop and mobile devices, we’ll help you get setup to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!

The precise IndieWebCamp Berlin [[health and safety policy]] is TBD (based on balancing a variety of needs and concerns), however to start with we strongly recommend:
* being fully vaccinated for COVID-19, including if possible the updated Fall 2024 booster
* bring KN95/FFP2, N95, or equivalently rated mask/respirator that you’re comfortable wearing in meeting rooms
* contact the [[#Organizers]] with any specific concerns / desires with respect to Health and Safety

Updates: similar to the [[2024/Portland|IndieWebCamp Portland]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Berlin 2024.
