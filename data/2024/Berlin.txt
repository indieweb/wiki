The precise IndieWebCamp Berlin [[health and safety policy]] is TBD (based on balancing a variety of needs and concerns), however to start with we strongly recommend:
* being fully vaccinated for COVID-19, including if possible the updated Fall 2024 booster
* bring KN95/FFP2, N95, or equivalently rated mask/respirator that you‚Äôre comfortable wearing in meeting rooms
* contact the [[#Organizers]] with any specific concerns / desires with respect to Health and Safety

Updates: similar to the [[2024/Portland|IndieWebCamp Portland]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Berlin 2024.
