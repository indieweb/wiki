'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Berlin 2024</dfn>''' is the '''eighth IndieWebCamp in [[Berlin]]''' and scheduled for 2024-11-09…10 the weekend after [[btconf]] [[Berlin]] 2024.

🗓 https://events.indieweb.org/2024/11/indiewebcamp-berlin-2024-XkH8P6vkmYNr

== Summary ==
IndieWebCamp Berlin is an '''all-levels''' BarCamp-like collaboration in Berlin for '''two days''' of keynotes, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping '''gain more control over our data and lives online'''!

Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and – maybe more importantly – encourage all users to own their own content and identities.

Bring your laptop and mobile devices, we’ll help you get setup to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!

{{section-stub}}
In order to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all, if you are feeling unwell, or any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, we request that you participate remotely.

If you are flying or taking a train to the IndieWebCamp to participate in person, please consider:
* In airports or stations: wear a N95 or KN95 mask at all times, except for any identity checks
* On the plane or train: wear a N95 or KN95 mask at all times, except to briefly pull it down to take a sip of water/liquids.

In the 4-5 days before IndieWebCamp (i.e. from November 5-9) please consider avoiding any situations that may risk exposure to contagious diseases, or at least wear a N95 or KN95 mask if you must enter such a situation (e.g. going to a hospital, pharmacy, on taking transit of any sort).

The precise IndieWebCamp Berlin [[health and safety policy]] is TBD (based on balancing a variety of needs and concerns), however in addition to the above we strongly recommend:
* being fully vaccinated for COVID-19, including if possible the updated Fall 2024 booster
* bring KN95/FFP2, N95, or equivalently rated mask/respirator that you’re comfortable wearing in meeting rooms
* contact the [[#Organizers]] with any specific concerns / desires with respect to Health and Safety

Updates: similar to the [[2024/Portland|IndieWebCamp Portland]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Berlin 2024.
