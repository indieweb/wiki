* 2024-08-21 Wednesday in Portland immediately before [[XOXOfest]]:
** +0 {{t}} — I could also make this, and appreciate the slightly more convenient for travel / lodging costs of keeping an IndieWebCamp adjacent to a larger event folks are going to. Would also consider coming in Monday for a Monday afternoon/early evening mini Organizers Summit.

** +0 {{snarfed}}
** -1 {{martymcguire}} get into Portland from NYC Weds late PM.

Dates — Opinions:
* {{t}} — would be nice to be adjacent to XOXO given overlap in community and topics/speakers announced for [https://2024.xoxofest.com/ XOXO 2024] (Molly White, Erin Kissane, Darius Kazmei)
* {{martymcguire}} - I'll be in Portland for XOXO (Which is August 22-24 2024) so I'm up for some adjacent IndieWeb event! I wouldn't recommend doing a full summit around this time, haha.
* {{addyourself}}

Check list for/during/after the event:
* ✅ Saving a table or two at 8am (or earlier) on Sunday the 25th
* ✅ Getting the word out to XOXO participants and getting RSVPs on the Event link
* ✅ Wiki page creating / editing (for all the usual pages we make for an IndieWebCamp)
* ✅ Bringing IndieWebCamp supplies (large sticky notes, sharpies for the Grid)
* ✅ Camp cleanup — everyone helped
