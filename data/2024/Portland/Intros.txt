== Introduction ==
{{t}} welcomes everyone. Impressive to have so many folks here after XOXO. Chill vibes today. Maybe informal breakout sessions. Hack + create + collaborate on your own site and/or indie social media.

We are following the [[code-of-conduct|IndieWeb]] and [https://xoxofest.com/guide/conduct/ XOXO Codes of Conduct]. [https://xoxofest.com/guide/covid/ XOXO mask policy]. any questions or issues see {{tantek}} or {{kevinmarks}} or {{snarfed}}.

{{snarfed}} points out our Zoom link at https://events.indieweb.org (which we can use for remote attendees and screen sharing). Backchannel discussion in the indieweb IRC/web/slack/etc. [[discuss]]ion channels.

{{tantek}}: We'll get an etherpad set up for the day (more later if needed).

Andy Baio at [[XOXO]] says to have a home on the web that's not controlled by a billionaire. 

It's ok to keep posting there, they are tools, and it can be practical. But we encourage you to also have your own site.

Note on [[photo policy]]: we don't have nice lanyards to indicate preferences. Ask for consent before taking photos.

== Tantek ==
{{t}} demos https://tantek.com/: uses it to post [[notes]], [[articles]], [[GitHub]] [[issue]]s & [[comment]]s, and more on his own site, and [[POSSE]] to destinations selectively.

== David Millar ==
{{dgtd}} at https://davegoesthedistance.com is up. 

Links a bunch of projects from here, has new ones to add. "indicates the ADHD happening up in my noggin". 

Publish puzzle books, community projects in DFW area. 

Tasting tacos wherever he goes. Was on TV once walking a maze from memory. Mike Tyson was there (... physically).

== Doug Beal ==
{{dougbeal}} @ https://dougbeal.com - [[WordPress]] site hasn't been updated for some years, but it was set up with [[WordPress Plugins|WordPress IndieWeb plugins]] and more years ago, and still works receiving [[Swarm]] posts from [[OwnYourSwarm]]!

== Ryan Barrett ==
{{snarfed}} @ https://snarfed.org - WordPress with [[note]], [[photo|pictures]], [[article|blog posts]], indieweb [[building blocks]], [[Webmentions]], [[like]]s, [[repost]]s, [[RSVP]]s. 

Showed RSVP example for this event. [[microformats]] are here (shouts to {{tantek}} and {{kevinmarks}} for [[microformats2]]). Shows Webmention displayed on https://events.indieweb.org/ event page.

Ryan runs https://brid.gy/ and https://fed.brid.gy. [[Bridgy Fed]] is new since his last in-person [[IWC]] event, bridging federated protocols and sites like [[ActivityPub]], [[Bluesky]], [[Nostr]], etc. 

Some Bridgy Fed stats: 
* ~20k users. ([[Bridgy]] classic ~7k.) 
* ~300-400k events per day! 
* lots of signups (but a few people "turning it off"). 
* lots of likes, then reposts, etc. ActivityPub is <em>very</em> chatty. 
* lots of repeat messages, but it's okay.

Bridgy Fed gets lots of [[Webfinger]] lookups... for some other instances (like [[mastodon.social]]). Seems like broken software. [[Mastodon]] most common software. then [[Misskey]]!

== Joe Crawford ==
{{artlung}} @ https://artlung.com - makes header images periodically. 

Been running [[Front End Study Hall]] (FrESH) in IndieWeb chat / Zoom for learning [[HTML]]/[[CSS]] etc. Folks have learned a lot! 

Mentioned some career bits.

Helped organize an IWC [[San Diego]]. Inherited a site of the day site from Joe.

Loves owning your own data. mistrust-based decision making. He is having a brat summer.

== Kevin Marks ==
{{kevinmarks}} @ https://kevinmarks.com/ - looking at making posting easier. 

Mostly hand-written HTML, long form, complicated posts with lots of little bits, like embeds, which can break over time. (looking at you, [[Twitter]]). 

Working on porting his [[Noter Live]] tool, for taking notes live at events, from Twitter to Mastodon.

Showed demo of NoterLive Masto work in progress!

You can see demo toot now at `@kevinmarks@indieweb.social`

https://indieweb.social/@kevinmarks/113024077565625675

Removed old [[Bootstrap]] layout, so it's bare. Planning to toot notes as people go today!

== Annika Backstrom ==
Annika @ https://sixohthree.com - area code for New Hampshire. 

Admin for [[xoxo.zone]] mastodon server. 

microformats + indieweb building blocks are new to her. Gonna carve out time to work on that w/ [[Pelican]] static site. Added [[h-card]] today!

{{gRegor}} @ https://gregorlove.com - domain is a nickname from "gregor. greg-or what?"

Posts [[note]]s and more. 

Shows example of a survey from Surveymonkey that he mirrored to his own site about COVID concerns.

gRegor runs https://indiebookclub.biz - a [[Micropub client]] for posting reading (want-to-read, finished, etc) to your site. Conceived at [[IWC Baltimore 2018]].

[[indiebookclub]] sends [[read]]s to your website, but also keeps them on your profile on indiebookclub, so Micropub is optional. You can download all your posts in HTML format for [[portability]]!

== Amy Hurst ==

Finished her day project already! Removed Twitter + [[LinkedIn]] from her site. Dealing with academia pre-semester scaries.

Likes making IndieWeb [[building blocks]], e.g. a suite of [[Micropub clients]] and [[tools]].

Newest project: https://banter.bayside.pub/ , for quick responses ([[reply|replies]], [[like]]s, [[repost]]s) via Micropub. Syndicates to [[Bridgy Fed]], [[IndieNews]], etc (and [[bookmark]]s and [[RSVP]]s!)

Uses [[Hugo]], which is good but struggles with date parsing details, it's too strict.

Also made and runs the [[IndieWeb Webring]]! https://ðŸ•¸.ws / https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/
