== Introduction ==
{{t}} welcomes everyone. impressive to have so many folks here after XOXO. chill vibes today. maybe breakout sessions. hack + create + collaborate on your own site and/or indie social media.

We are following the indieweb and xoxo codes of conduct. xoxo mask policy. any Qs see tantek or kevinmarks or snarfed.

snarfed points out our zoom link at http://events.indieweb.org (which we can use for remote attendees and screen sharing). backchannel discussion in the indieweb IRC/web/slack/etc.

we'll get an etherpad set up for the day (more later if needed)

tantek: andybaio @ XOXO says to have a home on the web that's not controlled by a billionaire. it's ok to keep posting there, they are tools, and it can be practical. but we encourage you to also have your own site.

Note on photo policy: we don't have nice lanyards to indicate preferences. ask for consent before taking photos.

== Tantek ==
demos https://tantek.com: notes, articles, github issues, and more.

== Doug Beal ==
{{dougbeal}} @ https://dougbeal.com - wordpress site hasn't been updated for some years, but it was set up with indieweb plugins and more years ago, and still works receiving Swarm posts from ownyourswarm!

== Ryan Barrett ==
{{snarfed}} @ https://snarfed.org - wordpress with notes, pictures, blog posts, indieweb building blocks, webmetions, likes reposts, RSVPs. looked at RSVP example for this event. microformats are here (shouts to tantek and kevinmarks for microformats2). shows webmention displayed on http://events.indieweb.org page.

ryan runs https://brid.gy and https://fed.brid.gy. bridgy fed is new since last in-person IWC event, bridging federated protocols and sites like activitypub, bluesky, nostr, etc. some bridgy fed stats: ~20k users. (bridgy classic ~7k.) ~300-400k events per day! lots of signups (but a few people "turning it off"). lots of likes, then reposts, etc. activitypub is _very_ chatty. lots of repeat messages, but it's okay.

bridgy fed gets lots of webfinger lookups... for some other instance (like mastodon.social). seems like broken software. mastodon most common software. then misskey!

== Joe Crawford ==
{{artlung}} @ https://artlung.com - makes header images periodically. been running Front End Study Hall (FrESH) in IndieWeb chat / zoom for learning HTML/CSS etc. folks have learned a lot! mentioned some career bits. helped organize an IWC San Diego. inherited a site of the day site from Joe. loves owning your own data. mistrust-based decision making. he is having a brat summer.

== Kevin Marks ==
{{kevinmarks}} @ https://kevinmarks.com - looking at making posting easier. mostly hand-written HTML, long form. complicated posts with lots of little bits, like embeds, which can break over time. (looking at you, twitter). working on porting his noterlive tool, for taking notes live at events, from twitter to mastodon

demo of NoterLive Masto WIP!

you can see demo toot now at `@kevinmarks@indieweb.social`

https://indieweb.social/@kevinmarks/113024077565625675

== gRegor ==
{{gRegor}} @ https://gregorlove.com - domain is a nickname from "gregor. greg-or what?" posts notes and more. shows example of a survey from surveymonkey that he mirrored to his own site about COVID concerns.

gRegor runs https://indiebookclub.biz - a micropub client for posting reading (want-to-read, finished, etc) to your site. conceived at IWC Baltimore 2018.

indiebookclub sends reads to your website, but also keeps them on your profile on indiebookclub, so micropub is optional. you can download all your posts in HTML format for portability!

newest project: https://banter.bayside.pub/ , for quick responses (replies, likes, reposts) via Micropub. syndicates to Bridgy Fed, IndieWeb News, etc (and bookmarks and RSVPs!)

uses Hugo, which is good but struggles with date parsing details, it's too strict
