'''<dfn>Create Day Demos</dfn>''' was the final session of [[2024/Portland|IndieWebCamp Portland 2024]] where participants showed and demonstrated what they made during the day.

* Archived from: https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-08-25#t1724627828753800 live notes taken by {{schmarty}}

== Kevin Marks ==
{{kevinmarks}} is going to demo first! 

1. [[Noter Live]] Masto edition. demo folks, shout out your fediverse handles, if you've got 'em, and he'll note live!

Enter a hashtag, @-@- handle of the person you're quoting, and enter the text. 

Toots it from `@kevinmarks@indieweb.social`

For subsequent entries, automatically tags the same person, so you can quickly continue a thread while the same person is speaking

2. made a bookmarklet for {{benwerd}}’s [[Share Openly]]. 

pops a window. enters xoxo.zone, shares to site. edits down the text for the target, etc. demos for http://bsky.app as well!

3. added a Share Openly button to posts on his own site, too!

encourages folks to look into Share Openly to makes [[POSSE]] a <em>lot</em> easier.

we'll try to have the sharer work

See the thread at https://indieweb.social/@kevinmarks/113025214809641781 for {{kevinmarks}} using what he built to live post about his and everybody else’s demos!

== David Millar ==
Dave (https://davegoesthedistance.com / @dave@puz.fun) next. 

Did some maintenance on personal site. updated [[IndieWeb Webring]] links to the new format. updated some projects. switched all [[book]] links to go to book pages on his own site. added folks to his homes/fam list. will continue polishing!

== Ryan Barrett ==
{{snarfed}} (https://snarfed.org / `@snarfed.org/@snarfed.org`) wanted easy [[interaction]]s with posts that he reads. jealous of how good [[silo]] users have it for this. 

Tried to get [[IndiePass]] working, but had issues. 

For comparison, look at [[Threads]]. One tap on a [[heart]] icon to like it. 

1. Opens his [[NewsBlur]], picks a post. Uses [[Android]] share feature. Taps his "Like" share target. Finds the like on his site - it's there!

His site also pings [[Bridgy Fed]] in the background, discovers that the target of the like is a [[Mastodon]] post, and queues that up to notify their mastodon server.

Shows how it works using "[[HTTP Shortcuts]]" app. Lets you configure [[HTTP]] requests and expose that as a share target. Templates bits let you pull details out of the shared post/page.

2. Shows similar flow for a [[reply]]. A separate shortcut, shows a reply text popup that is also part of HTTP Shortcuts. not one-tap but pretty close!

== Doug Beal ==
{{dougbeal}} (https://dougbeal.com / `@dougbeal@xoxo.zone`) sharing from [[mobile]].

1. Removed Twitter from his website!

2. [[RSVP]]'d to the upcoming [[HWC]] Pacific (this Wednesday!). had to send [[Webmention]] manually. his RSVP shows up on the http://events.indieweb.org event page. did it all from his phone!

== Tantek ==
{{t}} (https://tantek.com / `@tantek.com@tantek.com`) between [[IndieWebCamps]] has been working on larger [[auto-link]]ing changes. 

Worked with {{kevinmarks}} on it some today. has been coding on it, looking now to turn that into more of a specification. 

functionality clusters like:
* `@-name`, `@-domain`, `@-@-s`, etc. 
* [[hashtag]]s, and 
* [[footnote]]s, too. 

hopes that an auto-link specification may help someone else make an interoperable implementation.

Captured the discussion on his site, including links to previous posts where he discussed implementations of various pieces. Encourages discussion about all this work so far!

== Amy Hurst ==
Amy (https://amyhurst.com / no fediverse handle). 

Removed Twitter from her site!

== Joe Crawford ==
{{artlung}} (https://artlung.com) spent time blogging! 

Themes of XOXO. Erin Kissane classified [[XOXO]] talks into "I did this awesome thing on the web" vs "This awful thing happened to me because of the web". Wrote about some themes related to this. 

We have all the pieces we need to have great personal websites and interactivity. 

We don't know what is next but have real hope, reflected in quotes from speakers at XOXO. Hopeful for what is coming down the line. Also syndicated to http://indienews.org/

== Aaron Parecki ==
{{aaronpk}} (https://aaronpk.com / `@aaronpk@aaronparecki.com` ) arrived late and squashed bugs on some IndieWeb infrastructure. 

1. [[Slack]] users mentioning Slack channels in Slack were not translated correctly in [[IRC]]. Slack had changed something and broke things. aaronpk fixed that up! but also discovered new problems. 

2. Also noticed some [[emoji]] weren't translating correctly. The Slack bridge has its own emoji database which needed updated, so he updated it!

3. Worked to get [[trip]]s working on his site. Has automated features for this for years, but recently went on a trip with a huge number of data points spanning 1000 miles and 36 hours, and it was breaking his automation. with a couple of hacks, it was working again!

== Avi Bagla ==
Avi (https://www.avibagla.com/ / `avibagla@xoxo.zone`)

1. updated his portfolio site, including some new projects. 

2. signed up for mastodon at `xoxo.zone` and added that to his site, too!
