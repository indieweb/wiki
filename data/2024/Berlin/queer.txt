Topic introduction: Making the (indie)web more welcoming to different people, especially focusing more on non-developer blogs and sites and making them feel welcome (?)
* Question: What is meant by minority? 
** Rephrasing of statement: making it more inclusive of any type of person; being welcoming to all topics pertaining to the web/indieweb
* Different cultures in different web communities with various focuses
** No community is inclusive of everyone
* Inclusivity in the way of accessibility on the web
** many parts of the web completely inaccessible to some people
** ways of being more accessible on the web: including alternatives for people (no one size fits all), making navigation accessible, many different approaches (too deep a topic to discuss completely here perhaps?)
** https://inclusivedesignprinciples.info
** Welcoming beyong technical accessibility? -> experience should be of equal value but cannot be the same
** accessibility should not be an afterthought (trying to fit in accessible principles in post may not lead to a truly equal experience)
* Where does the indieweb end/begin -- Community of people participating in events or anyone who is a fan of the idea/has their own site?
** How to communicate that non-tech sites or less code focused sites and topics are also appreciated, if this just happens to be what most people are interested in within a group
** Diversity of topics for pop-ups, such as FreSH or carnivals
* More specific/clearer approach of code of conduct (eg: rule against sexism could be maliciously interpreted by people who see some feminist rhetoric as being "hate against men" being against the rules)
** could be very hard, focus should perhaps be on how the rules are applied by moderators
** The easiest way to avoid this is to gatekeep "entry" to the community, but this is probably not the way
* private vs public content within communities
** email instead of webmention/public responses
* self-censorship on the internet (?)
** focusing on technical writing to appease employers
** content that one doesn't want associated with their name
