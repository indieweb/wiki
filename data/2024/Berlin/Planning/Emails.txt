<pre>Hi {{ first_name }},

We are looking forward to seeing ~20 of you that have signed up at [IndieWebCamp Berlin](https://indieweb.org/2024/Berlin)! Registrations close on Wednesday the 6th at 6pm CET, so if you have any colleagues still thinking about it, get them signed up! We need everyone to register with full names in advance for our venue security.

Here are a few things you can do in advance to make the most of your time at IndieWebCamp:

- Join the IndieWeb [chat](https://chat.indieweb.org/) (via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UEp9p3yNYj) or [Slack](https://chat.indieweb.org/slack) if you like) and introduce yourself!
- [Add yourself to the IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org/wikifying) with additional info about yourself, such as what projects you’re working on, etc.
- You should plan to bring a laptop, iPad, notebooks, or whatever tools you use to write, design, code, or create on your personal website!
- Start considering discussion topics and what you want to create for your personal site!

Is this your first IndieWebCamp and want to know more about what to expect? See our [attending IndieWebCamp guide](https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attending).

IndieWebCamp has [Code of Conduct](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct) and [Health and Safety](https://indieweb.org/2024/Berlin#Health_and_Safety) policies.

We strongly encourage and support a diverse and inclusive environment. Please especially consider inviting your friends who are a different gender or have a different background than yourself.

We’ll be in touch again later this week with any last minute details.

See you soon,
