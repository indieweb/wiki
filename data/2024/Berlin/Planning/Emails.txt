<pre>Hi {{ first_name }},

We are looking forward to seeing to see ~20 of you that have signed up at [IndieWebCamp Berlin](https://indieweb.org/2024/Berlin)! Registrations close on Wednesday the 6th at 6pm CET, so if you have any colleagues still thinking about it, get them signed up! 

Here are a few things you can do in advance to make the most of your time at IndieWebCamp:

- Join the IndieWeb [chat](https://chat.indieweb.org/) (via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UEp9p3yNYj) or [Slack](https://chat.indieweb.org/slack) if you like) and introduce yourself!
- [Add yourself to the IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org/wikifying) with additional info about yourself, such as what projects you’re working on, etc.
- You should plan to bring a laptop, iPad, notebooks, or whatever tools you use to write, design, code, or create on your personal website!
- Start considering discussion topics and what you want to create for your personal site!

Is this your first IndieWebCamp and want to know more about what to expect? See our [attending IndieWebCamp guide](https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attending).

IndieWebCamp strongly encourages and supports a diverse and inclusive environment. Please especially consider inviting your friends who are a different gender or have a different background than yourself.

We’ll be in touch again next week with any last minute notes.

See you soon,

Tantek, Marc, Joschi, and James (IndieWebCamp Berlin organizers)</pre>
