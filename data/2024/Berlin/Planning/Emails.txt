<pre>Hi {{ first_name }},

We’re looking forward to seeing you at [IndieWebCamp Berlin](https://indieweb.org/2024/Berlin) – hard to believe it’s just 5 days away!

Here are a few things you can do to get ready and make the most of your time at IndieWebCamp:

- join the IndieWebCamp [chat](https://chat.indieweb.org/) (via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UEp9p3yNYj) or [Slack](https://chat.indieweb.org/slack) if you like) and introduce yourself!
- [add yourself to the IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org/wikifying) with additional info about yourself, such as what projects you’re working on, etc.
- Plan to bring your laptop, iPad, notebooks, or whatever tools you use to write, design, code, or create on your personal website!

We are excited to see ~20 of you that have signed up! Registrations close on Wednesday the 6th at 6pm CET, so if you have any colleagues still thinking about it, get them signed up! 

IndieWebCamp strongly encourages and supports a diverse and inclusive environment. Please especially consider inviting your friends who are a different gender or have a different background than yourself.

We’ll be in touch again next week with any last minute notes.

See you soon,

Tantek, Marc, Joschi, and James (co-organisers)</pre>
