* ... add notes
* There is a different experience, when writting in different context and apps and sites. Some are easier, some harder. Some are so easy, that one does not need to think about it.
* We are also talking about formating like punctuation, lyout, paragraphs, structures lists,...
* The chat interfaces, one can simply type something in and send.
* Twitter made it really simple to post it, slight harder than chat - one could see Twitter in the chat apps in the past and one could use Twitter from the chat
* Blogger or Wordpress are harder, since there are two text boxes
* GitHub have title, content and it make you think in term of markdown, so you think more about how to write markdown then the content
* Writting HTML is even harder
* Markdown is easier than rich text editor, because it creates the microdistraction
* Notion was the epitom the distraction, with how you could make the text prettier
* There are things in between the markdown and the HTML - Obsidian have the preview
* Some would not use Slack for long form (200-300 words)
** Some people write Slack messages, that are longer than 300 words ({{t}}, {{sarajaksa}})
** People will write multiple messages on the same topic, that could potentially become a posts
** Slack/chat window is small - the UI grows in Slack
** Slack has some advantages, like the draft, which are hard to lose by accident
* Slack has a very good editing UI - Slack automatically formats things as you type and you can edit it later
** Slack can work well for text, that do not need a lot of editer
** Slack is not that good for headers, it is good for posting lings, mentions and hashtags
** One can select the text, past the URL and it creates the link
* Code Mirror: https://codemirror.net/
** Some people write with vim-key bindings
** You could bring your preferences to it
* The context is to make it on your website
* Typora - better for the rewritting
* BBEdit - used to edit the posts (it is not a BBCode) - used by {{t}} https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/
* For the URL, one could simply add it as the URL and move on
* For the website, it would do a at-mentions to automatically link the mentions of people
* There are two things here: how to write easier and how to format things
* Sometimes we might need a conversion between them
