* James has been experimenting with different layouts and designs in different blog posts and how images are displayed
* https://pixelfed.org/ for hosting images
* layouting images on a website much like in a book + technical realization
** css based on html elements rather than classes
* https://tollwerk.de/blog/beyond-tellerrand-berlin-2024
* caption for context, alt for content
* imagemaps
* animated images (gif, svg with css)
** https://wingpang.com/ "text" image animation
* hover-over effect
** https://www.juliaracsko.com/ - traced variants of images to fit color theme/design, on hover they reveal original image in project specific style
