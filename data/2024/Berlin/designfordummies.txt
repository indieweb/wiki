* Accessibility
* having a way to quickly iterate on the layout and content — so that a current version never feels like a big commitment
* start with content and get inspired from there (Design fitting to the content)
* consider the possibility of maximum width for text
* share skills vs going it alone?
* themes are the quickest way to change the look of your website with the same content
* WordPress themes are an example of this

* looking for a CMS with a huge choice of themes
