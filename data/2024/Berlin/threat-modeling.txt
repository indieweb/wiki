== Notes ==
* Think about which people/institutions we wouldn't want to have access to our content
- potential employers, family

https://superbloom.design/learning/resources/persona-non-grata/

potential solutions:
- vanishing content? e.g. old Instagram on Mastodon posts
- what content is used to train LLMs? can you disable it? set up blocklists
- Web glaze (https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/webglaze.html) for images
- whatever is on the internet is public
