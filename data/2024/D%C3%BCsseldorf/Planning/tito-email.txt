<pre>Hi {{ first_name }}!

We’re looking forward to seeing you soon at [IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2024](https://indieweb.org/2024/Düsseldorf)! Here’s what you can look forward to for the next few days.

## Spring is here!

The forecast this weekend predicts it will be ~16 to 24 degrees Celsius (60–75 Fahrenheit).

## Impromptu Friday socialising

Those who arrive early often try and coordinate something for Friday night. We expect this to be no different this time around! Have a look at [the event schedule](https://indieweb.org/2024/Düsseldorf/Schedule#Friday) to see if any specific plans have already formed, or add yourself to the list if you’re interested! Otherwise it is usually easy to find someone [through our discussion channels](https://indieweb.org/discuss).

## Saturday

The doors open at 9:30am on Saturday! Please arrive promptly so we can get you checked in and ready to start the day!

* Time: Saturday at 9:30am
* Location: [Zentralbibliothek](https://www.duesseldorf.de/stadtbuechereien/bibliotheken/zentralbibliothek). Konrad-Adenauer-Platz 1, 40210 Düsseldorf, Germany

Feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions, or reach out through the previous mentioned [discussion channels](https://indieweb.org/discuss). See you soon!
