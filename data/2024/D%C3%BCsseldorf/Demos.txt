== Dave Letorey ==
I have loads and loads of posts, but no way of finding those posts without the URL

Went from an under-construction home page, to a list of posts which I've made into cards, and I made a post about what I did today!

What I did:
* list of posts on the home page
* header with a title, and a date
* footer with a list of tags of post

What I didn't get done
* sort posts by date
* add missing dates
* make the tags into links to show a list of posts with that tag
