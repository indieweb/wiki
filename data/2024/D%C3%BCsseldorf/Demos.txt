== To Do ==
Please see notes in chat starting at:

And copy paste and edit here as subsections for each person that demonstrated in order!

I have loads and loads of posts, but no way of finding those posts without the URL

Went from an under-construction home page, to a list of posts which I've made into cards, and I made a post about what I did today!

What I did:
* list of posts on the home page
* header with a title, and a date
* footer with a list of tags of post

What I didn't get done
* sort posts by date
* add missing dates
* make the tags into links to show a list of posts with that tag

Inspired by the last session of the day yesterday led by Paul, I did some brainstorming on additions and improvements to the [[Principles]] which we can iterate on.

My contribution is three things:

1. I took a bunch of input about "owning your identity" on the IndieWeb, and Jeremy Keith has talked about this as the number thing, so I wrote up a [[principles#Own_your_identity|proposal for an "Own Your Identity" principle]]. There's a section below if people like it they can add a +1 or -1 if they don't, and comments. I want to use the ‚úäüèª emoji for own your identity and maybe switch to the üóÑ file cabinet emoji for own your data.

2. Second one, is [[principles#Methodology|Methodology]]. Any discussion about evolving the principles and how the principles came to be, I realized there's a bunch of implicit stuff about that so I documented a few of these. Like why are the principles ordered the way they are, or how should they be ordered. We have focused on principles that are actionable, that actually encourage you to do something rather than principles that just make you feel good. We have principles that encourage you to do something in a positive direction rather than just being an avoid type thing. It's ok to say avoid something if you say what to do instead. It's not ok to just avoid something because that just makes you not do anything and what's the point of that? We also talked about making the principles more user-friendly to be more applicable to a broader community. That itself is a methodology that we want to adopt, making things more broadly applicable, user-friendly, accessible, developer-specific is ok but not ideal. I realized we need short, catchy, and memorable phrases like make what you need, use what you make, short, brief, memorable. Lastly, the list as a whole should be skimmable, you don't have to scroll through pages and pages of something like a manifest or something, or a whole book's worth to get to the points.

3. Third thing I did was, copy paste and start to trim-back the existing principles to a [[developer-principles]] stub page with a nice warning at the top. If we're going to improve the principles to be more user-facing, we should hold onto the developer-facing principles for developers that are more specific, like hey if you're a developer, here's how this principles applies to you, and your code, and your creations and such. 

That's what I started. I'd like to see us update the principles to be more user-facing, more user-centric too. This is a continuation of an organizers summit project from 2018, so hopefully six years later we'll pick this project back up and maybe we can push it to completion.

Following on from that, one of my project was also on the [[principles]]. I sort of did these separately, perhaps thinking from a little bit more of a content perspective and organizational perspective and quite high level perspective. This is a draft of what it could potentially look like, hopefully some of these changes follow on from those ideas and principles about principles you have Tantek.

Adding Identity as the first one, I pulled in the suggested text you had there for that.

For each of these principles I had a statement, these would be linked, and some real examples of how we practice what we preach.

Keeping own what you make.

Collaborate with others, this is something that tries to pull in suggestions like "show not tell", and we have a community and do discuss things, all those things that don't feel like they're captured in the existing principles, so this is sort of a new one or make explicit existing behavior.

Pluralistic, might be similar to that one, but this is about not being a monoculture, and having different approaches.

With each of these by the way, these are less developer-centric, more community, and more general, like I'm trying to point to how these would be applicable if you're not developing software, if you just have a website.

So like being pluralistic, you could have a blog, you could have a digital garden, you could have an about page, could be a CV, that's an example of plurality, it's not really about development per se. Not saying that everyone should blog, which sometimes can get misconstrued about IndieWeb being about blogging, it's about having a website, and that can be whatever you want it to be.

Build for the long web, that one is currently, [[longevity]], trying to make sure these all have titles that are action based. Sort of short, pithy titles, followed by a paragraph to be consistent.

Last one, keeping the web weird, sort of the same one as above all have fun. I like this is about enhancing the creativity. 

I also pulled out and repurposed the existing principles into development principles:

* [[User:Paulrobertlloyd.com/principles#Developer_Principles]]

Again with these trying to think of how these can all work consistently, so we've got make or made in the title. Underlines the making and doing aspects of these.

What we do next, I needed to get something up and manipulate and play with it and try to understand it a little bit more, based on discussions earlier.

Finally, I've just done some new banners and icons and made pull requests for all the IndieWeb WordPress Plugins, so when the pages finally update, they'll all have a consistent look and feel.

I started with an update of my account(?) and I added these two links. https://sonja-weckenmann.de/

And then I wanted to add a like button and I hope it works because I didn't quite finish. Joschi helped me a lot. Let's try it. It went up by two! (someone else: I clicked it also). But I have to change the styling.

I managed to hook up Webmentions using webmention.io, I started with Micropub, I also managed to blow everything up right before the demo.

Back in IndieWebCamp Brighton, I was planning about how to move on with my website https://jkphl.is/ I was thinking about how to create a new website. 

And in Brighton I decided I wanted to use AsciiDoc to write my website, it's like Markdown with more features. 

Today I spent my time on a pipeline for rendering AsciiDoc documents to my website. I have quite some history with AsciiDoc so I put together a set of tools based on Nodejs to render AsciiDoc documents to my website. 

I set up a test document with all the types of content I need, what I found out is that there is kind of templating process I can plug into and write little pieces of templates for all kinds of notes(?modes) and now I am at the point where there is something on the web and it looks like this at the moment.

Nice thing about AsciiDoc is that GitHub or GitLab is also able to display AsciiDoc documents. On GitLab is where I'm maintaining the code. 

Next thing I will work on is improving that template so the website actually looks like what I would like it to look like. After that I will migrate all my blog posts.

== Daniel Pietzsch ==
I'm Daniel, that's my website here https://danielpietzsch.com/ 

What I want to do is show upcoming events that I am going to attend on my website, there on the right side of my website. I can add a new one in Calendar application, "Hello IndieWeb", add this.

The other things I did was create a shortcut here to build my website "Build dp.com", I can trigger a build via GitLab which hosts my code. You can see there's a pipeline running there now. While that takes maybe a minute.

The calendar is public, so I have a https URL, and I just query that every time I build the site, and then I parse the data, put it into data in my Jekyll project, and use Jekyll stuff to update my site.

Now it's done. Refresh. There are two events now, refresh and it should show the third one, it says Beyond Tellerand number three (with Hello IndieWeb)!
