I have loads and loads of posts, but no way of finding those posts without the URL

Went from an under-construction home page, to a list of posts which I've made into cards, and I made a post about what I did today!

What I did:
* list of posts on the home page
* header with a title, and a date
* footer with a list of tags of post

What I didn't get done
* sort posts by date
* add missing dates
* make the tags into links to show a list of posts with that tag

Inspired by the last session of the day yesterday led by Paul, I did some brainstorming on additions and improvements to the [[Principles]] which we can iterate on.

My contribution is three things:

1. I took a bunch of input about "owning your identity" on the IndieWeb, and Jeremy Keith has talked about this as the number thing, so I wrote up a [[principles#Own_your_identity|proposal for an "Own Your Identity" principle]]. There's a section below if people like it they can add a +1 or -1 if they don't, and comments. I want to use the ‚úäüèª emoji for own your identity and maybe switch to the üóÑ file cabinet emoji for own your data.

2. Second one, is [[principles#Methodology|Methodology]]. Any discussion about evolving the principles and how the principles came to be, I realized there's a bunch of implicit stuff about that so I documented a few of these. Like why are the principles ordered the way they are, or how should they be ordered. We have focused on principles that are actionable, that actually encourage you to do something rather than principles that just make you feel good. We have principles that encourage you to do something in a positive direction rather than just being an avoid type thing. It's ok to say avoid something if you say what to do instead. It's not ok to just avoid something because that just makes you not do anything and what's the point of that? We also talked about making the principles more user-friendly to be more applicable to a broader community. That itself is a methodology that we want to adopt, making things more broadly applicable, user-friendly, accessible, developer-specific is ok but not ideal. I realized we need short, catchy, and memorable phrases like make what you need, use what you make, short, brief, memorable. Lastly, the list as a whole should be skimmable, you don't have to scroll through pages and pages of something like a manifest or something, or a whole book's worth to get to the points.

3. Third thing I did was, copy paste and start to trim-back the existing principles to a [[developer-principles]] stub page with a nice warning at the top. If we're going to improve the principles to be more user-facing, we should hold onto the developer-facing principles for developers that are more specific, like hey if you're a developer, here's how this principles applies to you, and your code, and your creations and such. 

That's what I started. I'd like to see us update the principles to be more user-facing, more user-centric too. This is a continuation of an organizers summit project from 2018, so hopefully six years later we'll pick this project back up and maybe we can push it to completion.
