'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2024 Planning</dfn>''' is the [[Planning]] page for [[2024/Düsseldorf|IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2024]]

Planning for IWC Düsseldorf 2024!

Organizers:
* {{marcthiele}} — cross-promotion with [[btconf]], ticketing
* {{jkphl}} — Saturday venue
* {{t}} - wiki editing, wrangling more co-organizers, working with {{jkphl}} and {{marcthiele}} to figure out details to make an IWC happen! Sunday venue search
* ... 

Venue:
* Saturday May 11: The City Library
* Sunday May 12: TBD — looking for local suggestions!

Sunday venue ideas?
* {{zegnat}} is going to ask around
* ...
* ...
* Fallback: lobbycon at the NH
** pros:
*** outlets / desks
*** lobby wifi
** cons:
*** is "in public"
*** no exclusive use/guarantee of the space - expect randoms to show up and use any available space
*** may get kicked out by the hotel 
** needs:
*** would need a way to project (micro/picoprojector?) for demos session
*** would need to set expectations of participants ordering at least a drink and/or snack from the hotel (perhaps at some frequency? like every 2 hours?) because the room in the middle of the hotel lobby and is serviced by the bar staff

Not this year (but has worked in past, maybe in future)
* CGI - need to message Marc about contacting them
* sipgate — will they be open to hosting an event for outsiders?
* ...

Interested in attending:
* {{t}}
* {{Maggie}}
* {{sarajaksa}}
* {{dominik}}
* {{lifeofpablo}}
* {{alex}} (remotely if early November)
* {{addyourself}}

Was interested in attending 2023:
* {{zegnat}} - happy to volunteer (setup, organiser tasks, [[code-of-conduct#Resolving_an_Issue|CoC contact]])
* {{gwg}} - Has never been to Dusseldorf and might want to try a new opportunity. Needs at least a month if not two notice to make an overseas journey.
* {{jeremycherfas}} - I would like to be there, if at all possible.
* {{addyourself}}
