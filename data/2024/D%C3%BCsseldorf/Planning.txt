'''<dfn>Planning</dfn>''' for [[2024/Düsseldorf|IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2024]].

Organizers:
* {{marcthiele}} — cross-promotion with [[btconf]], ticketing
* {{jkphl}} — Saturday venue
* {{t}} - wiki editing, wrangling more co-organizers, working with {{jkphl}} and {{marcthiele}} to figure out details to make an IWC happen! Sunday venue search
* {{gwg}} Attending, and happy to help in any way
* ... 

Venue:
* Saturday May 11: The City Library
* Sunday May 12: TBD — looking for local suggestions!

Sunday venue ideas?
* ...
* ...
* moderate chance fallback: lobbycon at the [https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/de/de/duesseldorf/dusmk/hoteldetail Holiday Inn] (where most of the IWC organizers are staying)
** may require someone who is staying there: {{t}}, {{gwg}}, {{capjamesg}}
** pros:
*** outlets / desks
*** (likely?) lobby wifi
** cons:
*** is "in public"
*** no exclusive use/guarantee of the space - expect randoms to show up and use any available space
*** may get kicked out by the hotel 
** needs:
*** would need a way to project (micro/picoprojector?) for demos session
*** would need to set expectations of participants ordering at least a drink and/or snack from the hotel (perhaps at some frequency? like every 2 hours?) because the room in the middle of the hotel lobby and is serviced by the bar staff

Not this year (but has worked in past, maybe in future)
