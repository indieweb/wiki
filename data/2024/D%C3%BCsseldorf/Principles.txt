== Notes ==
* Paul is leading this session
** Paul has questions around when the principles were last reviewed, how relevant they are, who is the audience, are the principles technical or community or both?
* Place to start: describe where the principles came from
** We should have a history section on /principles
** Principles page created in 2012; Tom was tired of saying "this indieweb thing" and having to explain it.
** Several community members have contributed to the principles.
** /principles was written using sentiments form the community over time.
* Several community members thought the principles were specifically developers in ~2014-16
** In response, principles were rewritten / reframed so that they are more broadly appealing
* Random idea: time slider for MediaWiki edits
* Principle #2 should be updated: it's technical. What does "machines second"?
* The IndieWeb is participatory -- we want that to be embodied in the principles
* The IndieWeb is active: you don't have a website because you want to read things (well, you could, using a domain for a login and nothing else -- that's okay!), you do it because you want to create.
* Use your personal website to exemplify things
* Some principles are user-centric, others are developer-centric.
* We did not finish editing the principles. We could work on this on Create Day.
** Say which ones are user-centric and leave those alone.
** Look at ones that are developer-centric and ask how we can update them to be more broadly appealing.
** Idea: We could have subheadings that group theprinciples.
* Principles page should be user-centric
** We could have a separate page on development principles -- that's where we can talk about open source and open standards.
* Should we challenge points in general to see if they still make sense?
** Yes.
* Some people may want their content to be deleted after a day, etc -- a photo of what you were doing on a day may not be something you want to archive. It's a question of distribution, though: the stories expire, but you still have the data.
* Point of principles is for the long-term; people who haven't cared about something have come around.
* How do you get people to start in the IndieWeb without having to have felt something being closed?
* Note: the principles don't talk about using your real name.
* Many young people haven't felt a platform shutting down so they don't have the same context.
* If you look at other organizations, the principles reflect the best wisdom of those communities.
** Not everyone will understand all the principles immediately.
** If you try to please everyone, you please no-one.
* Have a one-line sentence that is a summation of the overall mission/vission?
* ...
