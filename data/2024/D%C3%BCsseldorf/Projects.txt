Please list what you're working on for Create day below

== Tantek ==
* proposed additions and updates to [[principles]]
** ✅ "Own your identity" proposal: [[principles#Own_your_identity]]
** ✳️ document some of the methodologies behind the principles and how we came up with them, considered them, iterated on them etc., perhaps in a Brainstorming subsection [[principles#Methodology]] that could be moved to its own page eventually
*** in-progress: [[principles#Methodology]]
** ✳️ draft a set of [[developer-principles]] for retaining existing (and prior) developer-centric aspects of [[principles]]
** rewrite/reframe existing [[principles]] to be more user-centric rather than developer-centric, per [[2018/Organizers#IndieWeb_principles_split_and_reorg]] discussion
