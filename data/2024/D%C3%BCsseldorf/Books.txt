== Notes ==
* Readwise plugin lets you comment on a particular part of a web page
** A way to capture something someone likes on a personal website, you could blog on that.
** Collaborative annotations on something.
** OCR for book annotations
** https://hypothes.is/
* Idea: interactive book annotation tool that lets you highlight with your finger, then opens a text box to annotate.
* Use indiebookclub.biz to list books one is reading -- a Micropub client.
* Status tracking vs. reviewing vs just listing
* How do you make personal bookshelves social? - link of GoodReads 
* Randomly place a fake book that is an Easter egg that takes you to a hidden room in your website.
* Makes you "fall through" the trapdoor.
* Really long bookshelf or multiple shelves.
* Things you could do: Make /books page, or /library, or /antilibrary
* Sharing metadata across personal websites; tags that are shared
* Inline comments could be distracting
* BookWyrm -- supports ActivityPub -- basically Federated GoodReads
* Reilly shares books he has read on his personal website; hot link cover image from OpenLibrary
** OpenLibrary: information should be open without restriction.
* Tracy shares books, and Pablo
* Two use cases: Posts about reading, or lists.
* Personal library catalog.
* Idea: interactive scanning application with polygon highlights so you can choose which book to select.
* Aspirational personal library? Bookmarks of physical books you have seen.
* What is the best link for a website?
** Link to the author if they have a website where they advertise their books.
** Related: asin.cc for short Amazon links.
* "Are you telling me Shakespeare didn't have a personal website?"
* Link to author personal website, Wikipedia page for a book, or provide an ISBN
* Link to personal website: an independent linking to an independent
* Or you could link to your local bookstore
** What if the bookstore stops selling the book (i.e. you read a new title, they ran out of stock, and five years later they don't have one on order)?
** The bookstore could order more?
* List of books that people have recommended to you on your personal website?
** There are sites that collect together all bookstore catalogs into one and help you find the closest one with the book in stock, such as https://bookshop.org and http://indiebookstores.ca
* Organization systems for books - LOC
* Top rated picks
** Bookstores have this
** Helps people find a few books they may like
** Reference books live somewhere, fiction is somewhere else
* You could have multiple different sections
* API for book covers? (OpenLibrary)
* Use your website to track the location of books
* Search bar on personal website
* Value of books you have read is higher, so show those first?
* Highlight books to see a comment? (i.e. you should read another book first)
* Technical complexity as something to show
* Roy Tang’s Discworld page: https://roytang.net/topics/discworld/
* List of local booktores you recommend
** Bookstores may not respond from other locations(?) (i.e. US websites blocking EU due to GDPR)
** Example found/shown in session: https://www.booksmith.com/ (was unresponsive / timed out, also blocked https://validator.w3.org/ and https://indiewebify.me/)
** Has book permalinks based on ISBN-13 e.g.: https://web.archive.org/web/20230929112550/https://www.booksmith.com/book/9780060959470
* You could create a book permalink on your website with reviews, etc.
** Similar to indieweb [[venue]] pages
** Have a look at BookWyrm for inspiration
** Could have a list of every time you have mentioned the book on your blog, in a post
* Great example of indieweb book library: https://crashthearcade.com/book-list/
