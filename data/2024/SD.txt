== Health and Safety ==
{{emojicon|üò∑}}
Everyone attending IndieWebCamp San Diego is required to agree to the following policy.

This is a living policy and may receive clarifying edits between now and the event. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of the policy between the announcement and the event.

'''Masks'''

All attendees are required to wear a high-quality mask while inside the event venue, with the exception of those who can't mask for medical reasons.

Masks should be N95, KN95, or KF94 (or equivalent standard), cover the nose and mouth completely, and worn properly while inside the venue. Disposable ‚Äúpaper‚Äù surgical masks, masks with exhalation valves, and cloth masks are not permitted. [https://sipmask.com/ Sip masks] are permitted. Some masks will be made available in case you do not have one.

You may briefly remove your mask in between sips of a beverage, but otherwise it should remain on. We recommend stepping outside if you need a longer drink break.

If you need to unmask for eating or any other reason, please step outdoors.

'''Testing'''

Attendees are asked to monitor their health leading up to the event and are encouraged to test with an at-home antigen or rapid test before traveling to San Diego. While in San Diego, we recommend taking a COVID test before coming to the venue each day.

We encourage you to inform close contacts, should you test positive during or after the event, so that they can take appropriate precautions.

'''Illness'''

Under no circumstances should you attend if you test positive for COVID, experience respiratory symptoms (like flu, cold, RSV, COVID), or have any other reason to believe you may be ill or contagious. Remote attendance will be available via Zoom.

'''Ventilation'''

Our main venue is a long narrow room behind the storefront of Burn All Books. There is a front and a rear door and not many windows. An air purifier will be running in the meeting space and a CO2 monitor will be used as a proxy for the ventilation levels in the venue.

'''Before and After the Event'''

In at least the 5 days before IndieWebCamp (December 2-6th), we encourage attendees to wear a high-quality mask (as described above) in public indoor settings in order to avoid exposure to contagious diseases. This includes healthcare settings, stores, airports, airplanes, and public transit.

We encourage attendees to test 5 days after the event.
