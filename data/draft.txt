{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>draft</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb refers to a draft <em>[[post]]</em>, a post that an author has partially written, or otherwise does not consider finished.

== Why ==
Drafts are useful for private or semi-public sharing with others for review and feedback before official publication and [[POSSE]]ing.

Being able to save drafts has more than once saved me from posting something "in the heat of the moment" that I'd have later regretted. They can be a useful saucer for cooling off. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Some IndieWeb community members are using [[scheduling]] to publish drafts at otherwise public URLs, but not have them show up on their [[homepage]] (e.g. in their [[composite stream]]) or legacy [[feed file]].

== Open Source Examples ==
=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] has a draft feature that allows you to save a draft and share a URL to a draft post which does not show up on your home page or any feeds.

=== ProcessWire ===
[[ProcessWire]] has a published/unpublished flag that effectively allows writing a draft post that does not show up on your home page or any feeds. An unpublished page is visible only to logged in administrators at its permalink.
