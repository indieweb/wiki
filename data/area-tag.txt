An '''<dfn>area-tag</dfn>''' is a special kind of [[tag]] that tags a specific area or region of a post which can be used to tag a [[photo]] post with [[person-tag]]s at specific locations/areas where each person appears in the photo.

== How to ==
All examples are contextually inside an h-entry.

=== area tag with note ===
Area tag with a note:
<pre><nowiki>
<area class="p-category" shape="rect" coords="..."
      alt="tag here"/>
</nowiki></pre>

=== person tag as area tag ===
[[person-tag]] as an area-tag:
<pre><nowiki>
<area class="p-category h-card" shape="rect" coords="..." 
      alt="Ben Roberts" href="http://ben.thatmustbe.me/"/>
</nowiki></pre>

=== area tag reply ===
Area tags can be placed inside a [[tag-reply]] to tag some ''other'' post with area-specific tags, including person-tagging people at specific points/areas in someone else's photo post.

The [[reply-context]] for an area tag reply to a photo post for example should include the entire photo that is being area-tagged, so that the area element can overlay the portion of the photo. And a person area tag reply could actually display a name/link of the person tag, on top of the person in the photo, and even do hover effects triggered by point proximity or a rectangle overlaid on the person in the photo.

'''Potential [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request:'''

Once someone has implemented publishing an area tag reply on their own site, in particular, a person area tag reply to both an original post and e.g. a [[Facebook]] or [[Flickr]] POSSE copy of it (or at least a person photo tag of a silo photo post), it would be beneficial for Bridgy Publish to support POSSEing that tagging to the silo POSSE copy:
* Bridgy Publish to POSSE a copy of your "photo tag reply post" to a silo that has the photo (perhaps POSSE copy thereof), where Bridgy could do the photo-tagging for you on the silo as your reply post specifies to do.
