How to setup [http://microformats.org/wiki/web-sign-in web sign-in] on your own domain.

== Setup Instructions ==

=== 1. Link to your various social profiles on your home page ===

On your home page, link to your profiles and add the <code>rel="me"</code> attribute to the links.

This may look something like the following:

<pre><ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk" rel="me">@aaronpk on Twitter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk" rel="me">Github</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://google.com/+aaronpk" rel="me">Google</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:me@example.com" rel="me">me@example.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="sms:+15035551212" rel="me">(503) 555-1212</a></li>
</ul></pre>

If you don't want the links to be visible, you can use link elements in the head of your your homepage instead of visible links:

<pre>
<link rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk" />
</pre>

Note that visible links are preferred over invisible data, see [[antipattern#invisible_metadata|antipattern:invisible metadata]] for why.

This wiki uses indieauth.com to authenticate you. See [https://indieauth.com/#supported-providers indieauth.com] for a list of which of your services it can use to log you in.

=== 2. On each service, ensure there is a link back to your home page ===

You'll need to verify that each service has a link back to your home page. For convenience the "edit profile" links for all the supported services are below.

* [https://twitter.com/settings/profile Edit your Twitter profile]
* [https://plus.google.com/me/about/edit/d Edit your Google+ Profile]
* [https://github.com/settings/profile Edit your Github profile]
* [http://www.flickr.com/profile_edit.gne Edit your Flickr profile]
* Note: LinkedIn does not support rel=me links so can't be used

To authenticate using App.net, you’ll need to verify your domain with them.
* [https://account.app.net/settings/verification/ Verify your domain with App.net here].

Logging in via Persona (with an email address) and SMS don’t require you to add links anywhere, but instead verify your identity via Persona login or a short code sent to your phone, respectively.

=== 3. You're done! ===

That's it! You're done! Now you can use your domain to sign in to any sites that support [http://microformats.org/wiki/web-sign-in web sign-in]!

=== Known Issues ===

* 2014-01-18: It is worth noting that, for setting up your Google+ profile, you have to add your homepage as "Other profile" rather than as (or additional to) "Contributor to" (which is needed for Google authorship).
