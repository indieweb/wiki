A '''<dfn>tag reply</dfn>''' is a [[response]] to a post that tags that post with one or more [[tags]].

== Why ==
Tagging others' content is a very common [[silo]] UX and practice. By using your own site to tag others' content, you "ownyourtags" even if/when the [[silo-deaths|silos die]].

== How to ==
=== simple tag-reply ===
How to mark-up a tag reply, e.g. with the tags "indieweb" and "indiewebcamp":

Inside your usual [[h-entry]], use:
<pre>
<a class="u-tag-of" href="http://a.example.com/postpermalink37">...</a>
<span class="p-category">indieweb</span>
<span class="p-category">indiewebcamp</span>
</pre>

And then send a webmention from your tag reply permalink to <nowiki>http://a.example.com/postpermalink37</nowiki>.

Doing so will tag that postpermalink37 with the tags "indieweb" and "indiewebcamp".


=== tag and comment ===
To tag some other post, and comment on it at the same time:

Inside your usual [[h-entry]], use:
<pre>
<a class="u-in-reply-to u-tag-of" href="http://a.example.com/postpermalink37">...</a>
<p class="e-content">
This is a great post about the <span class="p-category">indieweb</span>
and <span class="p-category">indiewebcamp</span>.
</p>
</pre>

And then send a webmention from your tag reply permalink to <nowiki>http://a.example.com/postpermalink37</nowiki>.

Doing so will tag that postpermalink37 with the tags "indieweb" and "indiewebcamp", as well as make the comment <blockquote>This is a great post about the indieweb and indiewebcamp</blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
. None so far

== Silo Examples ==
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] allows people to tag other people's photos, both with plain text [[tags]], and [[person-tag]]s.

Sometime in 2000s-2014(?), if you hovered over a tag on a photo/video permalink page, it would show an HTML popup indicating who added it and when.

(screenshot needed)

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] allows people to [[person-tag]] other's photos.

If you hover over a person-tag on a photo/video, it shows an HTML popup card of that person, with small text at the top saying "Tagged by fullname" where fullname is the name of the person that added the tag.

(screenshot needed).
