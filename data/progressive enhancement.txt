'''<dfn>progressive enhancement</dfn>''' is the web development practice of building web pages, sites, apps so they are at least readable, and preferably allow for most if not all interactions, from any kind of browser, and optionally take advantage of additional capabilities (like various CSS & [[JS]] features) when available.

At a minimum, pages designed and built with progressive enhancement should be [[curlable]].
