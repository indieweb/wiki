Med hvert steg under vil du oppn√• forst√•else, uavhengighet og mer eierskap til din nettidentitet og ditt innhold, og sakte men sikkert komme deg videre p√• IndieWeb.

== Samfunn og hjelp ==
'''[[discuss|üë• Bli med i v√•rt chatterom]]''' for √• bli kjent med andre medlemmer av IndieWeb-samfunnet, som gledelig vil dele sine erfaringer og svare p√• sp√∏rsm√•l:
* '''[https://chat.indieweb.org/ üí¨ Online #indieweb-chat]''' (i nettleseren)
* '''[https://chat.indieweb.org/slack üí¨ #indiewebsamfunnet p√• Slack]''' - √•pen registrering
'''Hvorfor?''' Dette steget alene vil hjelpe deg √• raskt f√• svar p√• sp√∏rsm√•l om videre steg. Det er ikke p√•krevd, men vil nesten sikkert akselerere din framgang p√• IndieWeb.

Kom til et '''[[Homebrew Website Club]]-meetup''' i en by n√¶r deg og m√∏t IndieWeb-samfunnsmedlemmer ansikt-til-ansikt, sp√∏r sp√∏rsm√•l, og del opplevelser og motivasjoner for √• komme igang med IndieWeb.

== Skaff et personlig domene ==
{{main|personal-domain}}
üåê Du trenger et personlig domene du kan bruke som din nettidentitet:
* '''Skaff ditt eget personlige domene''' - Sp√∏r en venn eller kollega om en hvilken [[domain name registrar|domenenavn-registrar]] de anbefaler (f.eks. hvilken de bruker og liker/stoler p√•/respekterer)
* '''Domene-personvern''' - De fleste domenenavn-registrarer vil gj√∏re din personlige informasjon offentlig tilgjengelig (navn, postadresse, telefonnummer, epostadresseme). Mange registrarer tilbyr tilvalg for domene-personvern, s√• det er registrarens detaljer, og ikke dine, som st√•r i whois-registeret. Bare bruk domene-personvern hvis du stoler helt og fullt p√• tjenesteleverand√∏ren -- tvister om domenenavnets administrasjon eller overf√∏ringer kan blir problematisk hvis du ikke er registrert som den juridiske eieren av domenet.

'''Hvorfor?''' Se [[why-nb]]. Dette er det f√∏rste steget for √• bli med i indieweb, √• eie et domenenavn som du kan bruke som din hoved-identitet p√• nett.

== Get a place for your content ==
üìù Next, you need a place for your content.

Here are three options to choose from depending on your preferences.

=== GitHub Pages ===
GitHub pages are free and have a web interface for creating &amp; editing. For quick hosting you can use [[github-pages]] as a first step to get online. No installation needed.
* Follow the '''[https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site blank-gh-site]''' instructions to clone it and set it up in your GitHub account, or come to a [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetup and ask for help. You can be setup to publish in minutes.

There are other free but more limited options described in [[Transitional Steps]].

=== Web Hosting ===
Web hosting costs a little but provides much more capabilities.
* Sign up with a '''[[web hosting]]''' provider (ask friends and colleagues who they use for their personal websites that they're happy with, also see Lifehacker's [http://lifehacker.com/5911651/five-best-web-hosting-companies list of 5 best web hosting companies])
* Set up your domain name to be served by your web hosting provider

=== Home Server ===
Using your own server at home costs more and takes more time to set up ‚Äî for developers only.
* You can also self-host on your own server. Interesting to hobbyists are the many [[Small Computers]] available that can be used as servers, including Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black, Intel Galileo, and a host of other small, low-power computers.

== Set up your site ==
As a community with diverse interests, desires, and levels of technical know-how, there are multiple approaches to setting up a site on the Indieweb.

=== Simple One Page ===
üìÑ All you really need to get started is a simple one page site, which you can setup using the '''[https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site blank-gh-site  project]'''.
 
=== CMS Guides ===
üìë If you already know or have a preference for a content management system, see these specific guides for setting them up on your domain.
* [[Getting Started on WordPress]]
* [[Getting Started with Known]]
These two are highly recommended and have dedicated [[discuss|help and support forums]], see the '''[[projects]]''' page for more options. 

If your web hosting provider has a control panel like [[cPanel]] or [[Fantastico]], it may allow have an option to quickly set up a content management system in a few clicks.

== Set up your home page and web sign-in ==
{{main|How to set up web sign-in on your own domain}}
üè° Create and upload a simple <code>index.html</code> [[home page]] with your name, [[icon]], and [[rel-me]] links to your social network profiles. Make sure that the profiles link back to your domain.

The website https://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ has a handy tool to validate that your domain name and profiles are linked together correctly.

'''Why?''' This ensures that it is easy to see that your profile on the social networks are all the same person as your domain name. This will also allow you to sign in to sites that support [[IndieAuth]] ‚Äî like this wiki!

=== Tools ===
[https://indiewebify.me/ üîß Indiewebify.me] provides step-by-step guidance and tools to test & validate your progress. See [[Tools]] for more useful things for building & debugging an IndieWeb site.

== Add info about yourself ==
üë§ Update your <code>index.html</code> home page to include your basic information in an [[h-card]]. This h-card can be as simple as your name.

The website https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-card/ has a handy tool to validate your h-card.

'''Why?''' When you publish content, you can link back to your home page using [[rel-author]] and your authorship information can be retrieved from the h-card.

'''Advantages:''' While you are not yet publishing content on your own site, at this point you have:
# Staked your claim on the indieweb
# Set up an identity that you own and control

'''Why add my basic contact information in an h-card?'''
* This helps with providing authorship information for anything you publish and link back to your home page with [[rel-author]].

These are small but important steps to declaring your independence from content [[silo]]s.

== Add links to existing social media ==
‚ú¥Ô∏è '''Why add links to your social media profiles?'''
* By linking from your personal site to your existing social media, and having your social media profiles link to your personal site, it sets you up to use your domain as your [[IndieAuth]] identity ‚Äî to sign into this wiki for example. For more details, see: [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain|setup web sign-in]].

'''Advantages:''' while you are not sharing your content on your own site yet,
* you've staked your claim on the indie web, and 
* setup an identity that you own and control. 

== Publish content on your domain ==
üì∞ Using whatever project or CMS you have installed on your server, post something!

== Add microformats to your content ==
üìë Add the [[h-entry]] microformat markup to your posts. Many CMSs and themes already support them!

You can use the '''[https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/ h-entry validator]''' to verify that your recent post has validate your h-entry.

'''Why?''' This will allow other people's software to easily read and understand your content. This is useful for a variety of things like recognizing [[comments]], [[likes]], [[reposts]], and displaying [[reply-context]]s for your posts.

== Syndicate Elsewhere ==
{{main|POSSE}}

üì§ Set up automatic [[syndication-models|syndication]] of your posts so copies of your IndieWeb content can be published (semi-automatically) to your existing social media so your followers there will see your IndieWeb content . 

This practice is called [[POSSE]], short for '''Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere'''.

By setting up POSSE, you can have your posts pushed to specific social media [[silos]] with a personal [[permalink]] back to the original on your own site.

'''Why?''' By POSSEing your content to silos, you allow those that read content on those silos to continue seeing what you have to say, while you retain ownership and control of your content on your own site.

'''Remember:''' Incremental progress is OK and encouraged! POSSE does not have to be totally automatic to be effective. Use a CMS with POSSE support (or POSSE plugin for it), or post on your site and manually sharing to social media (including a link back to the original). This will help you figure out what works for you and what is worth the effort to automate.

== Share and Join Us ==
Next steps:
* Share what you did / discovered in the process of building your IndieWeb site, even if it is only a single page, with a simple design.
* Ask what you can/should do next in the [[discuss]]ion channels.
* Check the list of [[events]] and join us at the next IndieWebCamp or [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetup!
* Once you can [[IndieAuth]] or log into the wiki, create your [https://indieweb.org/wikifying#Wikify_yourself user page] by wikifying yourself.
* Document what you've done and add your site and details to the IndieWeb examples section of relevant pages to share what and how you've done it with others.

== Optional / Bonus Steps ==

=== Port old silo content to your site ===
Once you are posting on your own site and [[POSSE]]'ing out content to social silos, port your old silo content to your own site with permalinks on your site. Typically this involves a one-time export and batch import process. Here are some popular social content silos:
* [[Twitter]]
* [[Tumblr]]
* [[Facebook]]
* ...
* Also consider sites you use which may be shutting down soon, see: [[site-deaths#Upcoming]]

=== Set up a personal URL shortener ===
{{main|permashortlinks}}

'''Why?''' A personal ''[[short domain]]'' is key to creating [[permashortlinks]] which help:
* Provide [[discovery|discoverable]] permashortcitations in [[POSSE]]d notes, e.g. on [[Twitter]], which itself enables [[original-post-discovery]].
* [[POSSE]]ing to [[silos]] that have post length limits, but don't wrap your links, e.g.
** [[Foursquare]] notes (along with [[checkin]] posts)
** ...

'''How?'''
* For WordPress, install and use the [http://willnorris.com/2011/01/hum-personal-url-shortener-wordpress Hum personal shortener plugin].
* For others, take a look at porting the existing open source [http://tantek.com/w/Whistle Whistle] algorithmic URL shortener to your system.
