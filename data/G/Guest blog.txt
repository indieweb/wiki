'''<dfn>Guest blog</dfn>''' is a practice of allowing another author to publish on your blog or website or publishing on someone else's website. This occurs when bloggers who post on a regular schedule have people write during vacations, to attract exposure, as a marketing tool, and as a leadership tool to develop newer bloggers.
