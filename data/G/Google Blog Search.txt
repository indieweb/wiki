{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Google Blog Search</dfn>''' was launched in 2015 as a competitor to [[Technorati]] Search that provided very fast but very incomplete results (from an arbitrary fractional subset of [[blog]]s), which then shut down on 2011-05-26 after Technorati itself pivoted away from blog search.
