{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Google Blog Search</dfn>''' was a low quality clone of [[Technorati]] that provided very fast but very incomplete results (from an arbitrary fractional subset of blogs) that was still apparently competitive enough for big topics to drive marketshare away from Technorati, and then subsequently shut down some time after Technorati itself gave up on blog search.
