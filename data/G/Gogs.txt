'''<dfn>Gogs</dfn>''' is a self-hosted [[:Category:Software Forge|software forge]] with additional features such as issue management.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} has been running a Gogs server for private repositories since 2016-02-13, and [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/02/13/18/ wrote a post about the process of setting it up]

== Criticism ==

Apparent lack of dogfooding: Gogs is developed and hosted on [https://github.com/gogits/gogs GitHub].

Development process: complaints about not enough activity by the maintainer lead to the creation of the fork [[Gitea]] which in turn led to [[Forgejo]] .
