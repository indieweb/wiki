{{main|Gemini protocol}}

The gemini protocol allows users with dedicated clients (such as [https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/ Lagrange]) download documents and explore following links in a similar fashion to the regular web. It is a modern protocol but with a focus in simplicity and security.

The associated file format to this protocol is the gemtext which displays only Text lines, Link lines, Heading lines, List items, Quote lines and Preformat toggle lines.
