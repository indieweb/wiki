'''<dfn>Gemini</dfn>''' is an application-level internet protocol for the distribution of arbitrary text and other files and pages, with special consideration for serving a lightweight hypertext format with privacy and security in mind. A person can start a Geminispace with very little effort and host if from a low-end device at home.

<blockquote>You may think of Gemini as "the web, stripped right back to its essence" or as "Gopher, souped up and modernised a little", depending upon your perspective.</blockquote>

== Concepts ==

<blockquote>Gemini is intended to be simple, but not necessarily as simple as possible. Instead, the design strives to maximise its "power to weight ratio", while keeping its weight within acceptable limits.  Gemini is also intended to be very privacy conscious, to be difficult to extend in the future (so that it will *stay* simple and privacy conscious), and to be compatible with a "do it yourself" computing ethos.  For this last reason, Gemini is technically very familiar and conservative: it's a protocol in the traditional client-server request-response paradigm, and is built on mature, standardised technology like URIs, MIME media types, and TLS.</blockquote>

Gemini sites are called "capsules" and are hosted by Gemini protocol servers.

To access Gemini sites with current web browsers an Web-to-Gemini proxy is necessary.

== Software ==

There are [https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/software/ dedicated servers and clients] available for many platforms.

== Gemtext Format ==

Gemini capsules consists of files made up using the [https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/gemtext.gmi Gemtext markup language], but the protocol serve any file format.

Capsule owners can keep a [[gemblog]] for posting a blog on Gemini.

== Publication ==

Aggregators will collect new [[gemblog]] posts, which can also be served as Atoms feeds.

The platform has search engines dedicated to finding content on Gemini sites.
