The '''<dfn>Gemini</dfn>''' protocol is an application-level internet protocol for the distribution of arbitrary files, with some special consideration for serving a lightweight hypertext format which facilitates linking between files.

You may think of Gemini as "the web, stripped right back to its essence" or as "[[Gopher]], souped up and modernised a little", depending upon your perspective.
