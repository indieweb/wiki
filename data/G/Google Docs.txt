'''<dfn>Google Docs</dfn>''' is a free and fairly user-friendly document creating, collaborative editing, and sharing silo from [[Google]] that sometimes fails inexplicably.

== Issues ==
=== Sharing unavailable ===
Perhaps the most important feature of Google Docs, collaborative editing, if often blocked, because of a "Sharing unavailable" error preventing you from sharing the document with others to edit together.

When you click the blue [Share] link/button in the top right corner, sometimes you'll see a spinning cursor for a bit and then this alert:

* {{t}}: I have seen this error at least once a day when attempting to share a Google Doc with others. In comparison I have never had nor seen any similar problem with [[Etherpad]].
