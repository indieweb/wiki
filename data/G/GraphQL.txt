'''<dfn>GraphQL</dfn>''' is a query language for [[API]]s and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data. In terms of the IndieWeb it could be used to retrieve your posts from your site [[database]] or other backend.


== IndieWeb Examples ==

* [[Together Server]] is a GraphQL server that acts as a bridge [[Micropub]] and [[Microsub]].

== Brainstorming ==

* Create a web service which allows any website marked up with MF2 to be queried using GraphQL. For inspiration, see [https://coolql.cool CoolQLCool]

** "I think GraphQL is quickly moving to one of my least favorite technologies. Building an efficient query system for the server is almost writing a database and as a user it has a lot of rough edges. Good idea but man is it complex." [http://lucumr.pocoo.org/ @mitsuhiko] July 28, 2022

** <blockquote><i>[…]</i> I have had the opportunity to deploy to environments where non functional requirements like security, performance, and maintainability were more of a concern, my perspective has changed. In this article I would like to take you through why today, <strong>I would not recommend GraphQL to most people</strong>, and what I think are better alternatives.</blockquote>
