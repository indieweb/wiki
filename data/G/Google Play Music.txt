== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== David Peach ===
{{davidpeach}} has built a small hack on his personal site to scrape a url that is passed over from a bookmarklet. The scraping uses [[PhantomJS]] to allow for pulling in of [[JavaScript]]-created content.

Article on how this is implemented : [http://davidpea.ch/articles/671 Semi-automated PESOS from google play music]

* At the moment the following things are pulled through: 
** Artist
** Album
** Basic album info
** Album art.
* See an example of the data being used on [http://davidpea.ch David's web site].

=== Tristan Havelick ===

[[User:Tristanhavelick.com]] has created a page that contains tracks recently played on Google Play Music.  Here's roughly how it works:

* https://github.com/erik/lastcast is used to post tracks played in Google Play Music via Google Home or Chromecast to the website libre.fm (which is an open source version of last.fm)
* The page https://www.tristanhavelick.com/music/ is generated from the data exposed on this libre.fm API endpoint: https://libre.fm/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks&user=thavelick&page=1&limit=10&format=json
