'''<dfn>[http://gmail.com Gmail]</dfn>''' is an [[email]] reading, composing, and searching client and service hosted by [[Google]].

In addition to the gmail.com website, there are also Gmail client applications for various platforms (iOS, Android) that connect to the Gmail service.

== Backup ==
If you have experience backing up gmail accounts, please help expand this section!

=== Gmvault ===

* Gmvault seems to be very simple and straight forward. It's on the command line, so it's scary for some users, but it does a good job of describing what it does. I ({{Sebsel}} at 2017-01-31) did the following on my Mac, and since I can't remember installing <code>pip</code>, I think this works out of the box:
** <code>sudo pip install --upgrade pip</code>
** <code>sudo pip install gmvault</code>
** <code>gmvault sync example@gmail.com</code>
** Gmvault prompts for OAuth, with a description. Press enter to open the browser, and you have to make sure you are logged in at that browser to the Gmail account.
** Do the OAuth in de browser and copy the key. Paste it in the Terminal
** Gmvault does things! I got 6351 mails out of an old account in 16m 14s. It creates a folder called 'gmvault-db' in your home folder, with (in /db/) folders for every month. In those folders are, per e-mail, an '[id].meta' and an '[id].eml.gz'. The .meta is a JSON with info from Gmail (labels/tags, subject) and the .eml.gz is a gzipped .eml, which is just the plain-text e-mail with all the headers.

== Downtime ==
Gmail is down occasionally, usually only briefly.

If you get a [[500]] error like this, try again in a few minutes:

== Criticism ==
=== Abandons browsers ===
Gmail seems to abandon browsers for no particularly good reason, given that email UIs have very simple layout / interaction needs.
* Note: This is Google's general browser support policy: support the current and previous major releases of the browser. [https://cloud.googleblog.com/2011/06/our-plans-to-support-modern-browsers.html]

* 2016-03-31 screenshot of Safari 6.1.6 (7537.78.2) with Gmail showing a warning: <blockquote>This version of Safari is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser. Dismiss</blockquote>

=== Vague and generic updates explanations ===
Gmail's iOS app update [[release notes]] are often vague and generic.
<blockquote>Bug fixes and performance improvements.</blockquote> is neither informative, nor a very convincing reason to update.
