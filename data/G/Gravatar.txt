'''<dfn>[https://gravatar.com Gravatar]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] service run by [[Automattic]] to host a [[profile photo]] (avatar) for e-mail addresses. The photos can then automatically be displayed on your posts and comments on any website that supports it. Some sites use the service to also provide [[hovercard]]s with additional identity information.

== Features ==
* Supports [[rel-me]] verification. See [[rel-me#Gravatar]]
* ...

== Criticism ==
Gravatar is based on MD5 hashes of e-mail addresses, which has been used to deanonymize users in the past: [http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/12/crypto-weakness-in-web-comment-system-exposes-hate-mongering-politicians/], [https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/79856]. You're effectively leaking weakly-hashed user data.

=== Web3 support ===
In 2024, Gravatar wrote about the use of [[Web 3.0]] and [[blockchain]].
