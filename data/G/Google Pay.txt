'''<dfn>[https://pay.google.com/about/ Google Pay]</dfn>''' is a mobile [[payments]] app scheduled to shut down 2024-06-04 [https://blog.google/products/google-pay/payment-apps-update/]. It lets you send money to someone using their email address or phone number, but that functionality will end 2024-06-04. Google Pay will still work for online checkout. The tap-to-pay app functionality is now in the [[Google Wallet]] app.

== Rebranding and website takedown ==
The service was renamed when the Google Wallet and Android Pay services were combined, pivoting more to focus more on purchases. This lead to the removal of the web UI and [[Gmail]] integration. From the app, users can still generate a link to share for payments, though the link opens the Google Pay app.
