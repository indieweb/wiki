== Rebranding and website takedown ==
The service was renamed when the Google Wallet and Android Pay services were combined, pivoting more to focus more on purchases. This lead to the removal of the web UI and [[Gmail]] integration. From the app, users can still generate a link to share for payments, though the link opens the Google Pay app.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Anthony Ciccarello ===
{{aciccarello}} previously included Google Pay as an option on his [[pay]] page. Since web payments were not supported he listed his email address. Removed it as an option 2024-03-12 following the service shutdown announcement.
