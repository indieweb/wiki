'''<dfn>[http://goodreads.com Goodreads]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] for keeping track of [[books]], reviews, and reading progress. [[Amazon]] purchased Goodreads in 2013.

== How to export your data ==
Goodreads provides <span id="Export">[[export]] of book lists to csv, txt or xls files [https://www.goodreads.com/help#import_books].

* Would be good to mung any of these into h-review based files for import into an indiewebsite -- {{kartik}}

There is also a plugin for the desktop software [https://calibre-ebook.com/ Calibre] that will allow one to sync large portions of their data directly to their computer.

== Features ==
* Multiple shelves to categorize your books.
** Books can be put on multiple shelves.
** There are three core, "exclusive" shelves: read, currently-reading, and to-read.
*** All books must be in one and only one of these shelves.
*** Additional "exclusive" shelves can be added by the user.
* When a book is on the currently-reading shelf, you can post reading progress updates
** A page number or percentage can be entered
** Optionally, a status of up to 420 characters can be entered
** The currently-reading list shows the percentage complete based on your last reading progress update
* A stream of your friends' added books and reading progress updates
** Each can be [[comment]]ed on or [[liked]]
* An annual reading challenge where you can select the number of books you want to read during that year.
** Your reading progress is tracked and informs you whether you are on track or # books behind.

== POSSE to Goodreads ==
* {{gRegor}} has manually [[POSSE]]d reviews to Goodreads.

* {{chrisaldrich}} has been manually POSSEing both status updates and reviews to GoodReads since [http://boffosocko.com/2016/09/17/as-of-91316-im-beginning-to-own-all-of-my-reading-data-into-from-goodreads-%F0%9F%93%9A-indieweb/ 2016-09-13]. Examples can be found in [http://boffosocko.com/?kind=note&cat=945 this feed].

== API for Goodreads ==
Goodreads does have a [https://www.goodreads.com/api/documentation very complete API] that could be used to automate [[POSSE]]. 

As of 2015-12-29, [[silo.pub]] has support for publishing to Goodreads via a [[micropub]] API.

The API appears to be good for posting information to Goodreads but not as good for reading information, e.g. for [[PESOS]]. For example, there does not appear to be a method to directly retrieve a user's updates (reading progress, reviews). The user.show method gets a user's information along with their 10 latest updates, though. It appears multiple calls to different endpoints are necessary to get more complete information.
* In the Goodreads Developers group there is a thread titled "Is the public API maintained at all?" raising some concerns about some things being broken, apparently lack of [[selfdogfooding]] by Goodreads (instead using a private, undocumented API). Quite a few other developers echoed the concerns. The thread was started 2017-03-19 and there does not appear to be an official response from Goodreads as of 2019-03-08.

== Brainstorming POSSE ==

To POSSE a [[review]] to Goodreads would basically involve:

# creating an API key and secret with Goodreads
# OAuthing on behalf of the user
# Searching for the book_id in Goodreads
# Searching for the "shelf" in Goodreads
# Posting the review

Their API guidelines also *require* a link back to the "original" post in Goodreads.
* What if the post on Goodreads is a copy and not the original? - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]]
