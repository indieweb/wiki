<dfn>'''[https://www.google.com/calendar Google Calendar]'''</dfn> is an [[event]] hosting [[silo]] and calendar web application from [[Google]].

== Export ==
[https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111?hl=en Google provides a way to get a URL to poll the calendar data], meaning that you can use it as a user interface for data entry and manipulation, and extract the content for repurposing elsewhere.

== "Add to Calendar" Links ==
Some event hosting silos such as [[Eventbrite]] offer "Add to Calendar" functionality to export events to a visitor's preferred calendar, including Google Calendar.

=== Constructing an Add to Google Calendar Link ===

It's possible to construct a link that adds an event to a Google Calendar. For example:

 <nowiki><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&
text=Your+Event+Name&
dates=20140127T224000Z/20140320T221500Z&
details=For+details,+link+here:+http://www.example.com&
location=Waldorf+Astoria,+301+Park+Ave+,+New+York,+NY+10022&
sf=true&
output=xml">Add to Google Calendar</a></nowiki>
