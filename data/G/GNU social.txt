{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://gnu.io/social GNU social]</dfn>''' is a free software [[project]] that "will be a decentralized social network that you can install on your own server".

GNU social spun out of the [[GNU FM]] project to avoid the defacto GNU FM server[https://libre.fm]  becoming a social silo.

On 2013-06-08, GNU social incorporated [[StatusNet]] and Free Social, so a lot of this page is old StatusNet information as well. [https://www.gnu.org/software/social/merge.html]

== Syndication ==
GNU social uses the OStatus protocol (based on Atom or RSS feeds published in realtime via [[Pubsubhubbub]]). As a result, GNU social users can subscribe ''directly'' to an external site that publishes a [[How_to_set_up_your_realtime_feed|Realtime feed]].

 <tantek> there was never a need to syndicate to Status.net
 <tantek> users on Status.net were able to directly subscribe to *external* sites in realtime if they supported PuSH
 <tantek> Federation as it were
 <tantek> the only reason to POSSE to a service is if a) you have friends on that service (otherwise you're just spamming), and b) that service only allows people to subscribe to local-to-the-service accounts.
 <tantek> in the case of Status.net, b) was not true.

To follow any [[Pubsubhubbub]] feed with a GNU Social instance, simply click the "+ Remote" button in the sidebar when looking at your profile page and enter the URL to the HTML page from which such a feed can be discovered.  Some instances run a theme which hides this button (or makes it harder to find).  You can always go to /main/ostatussub to subscribe to a feed (such as: http://quitter.se/main/ostatussub)

Here's an example of one of Tantek's notes reposted by a GNU social user [https://status.ssweeny.net/notice/304641]. Amusingly, when posts from tantek.com were reshared by a GNU social user syndicating to Twitter, it converted references from tantek.com to @tantekcom [https://twitter.com/search?q=%40tantekcom%20%40evanpro%20evan.status.net&src=typd&f=realtime], which did not exist until [https://twitter.com/tantekcom/status/14190824867].

== Open Questions ==
How does an indieweb site get a proper looking profile on a GNU social site? Compare @tantekcom@tantek.com and @kyle@kylewm.com (which has the same Atom components)

* Recommended Atom feed content is an Atom author with name/url (for nickname/profileurl) and then an Atom link in the author with rel=photo or rel=avatar -- [[User:Singpolyma.net|singpolyma]] 07:42, 29 October 2015 (PDT)
** GNU Social will also attempt to read an hCard or h-card on the URL that it is given (if you give it a page to detect the feed from and not just a direct feed URL) which likely explains the discrepancy that caused this question. [[User:Singpolyma.net|singpolyma]] 19:09, 27 October 2015 (PDT)

== IndieWeb Compatibility ==
* As of 2014-04-23, posts are now marked up with microformats2 [https://social.umeahackerspace.se/conversation/115235 thanks to Mikael Nordfeldth] (one of the primary developers), spurred by [http://microformats.org/2014/06/20/microformats-org-turns-9-upgrade-to-microformats2 Microformats.org Turns 9]
* As of 2015-12-14, webmention support was added thanks to [[User:Singpolyma.net|singpolyma]].  Support is optional and disabled by default.  https://git.gnu.io/gnu/gnu-social/merge_requests/41/commits

=== Requests ===
Are there outstanding bugs / issues filed for these yet?
* GNU Social should support consuming [[PuSH]] + [[h-feed]]
* GNU Social should accept [[Webmention]]s by default and process them for replies, likes, reposts
** primary maintainer MMN has expressed interest in this https://social.umeahackerspace.se/notice/1250616

== IndieWeb Examples ==
No IndieWeb community members are currently using GNU social on their own site.

Are you using or self-hosting an install of GNU social?
* {{addyourself}}

=== Past Examples ===
* Evan Prodromou (2012) : was using StatusNet on <nowiki>http://evan.status.net/</nowiki> (2012(?)-2013)
** 2013 Evan has moved to [[pump.io]]
* GNU social founder {{mattl}} (2014) on mattl dot io (no longer mine) since 2014-??-?? (need precise date of deployment of GNU social at this domain)

== Examples ==
Notable example deployments of GNU social:

As of 2016-02, there are several [[Twitter]] lookalike gnusocial instances such as 
* https://quitter.se and 
* https://quitter.no 
These feature a [[public_timeline]] as their main view in a consciously retro-twitter look. These are based on the [https://github.com/hannesmannerheim/qvitter Qvitter] code open sourced by [http://quitter.se/doc/faq Quitter.se] 

In response to Twitter clamping down on abuse, there have also been instances set up that are troll-themed, such as:
* '''sealion.club'''
* '''shitposters.club''' (with its own rules: shitposter.club/notice/42220)
* '''freezepeach.xyz''' 
(all unlinked due to likely [[code-of-conduct]] violations, those curious can copy paste the domain explicitly).

== Issues ==
=== js dr ===
GNU social using Quitter appears non-functional and nearly empty without JS (e.g. [https://quitter.no/notice/1062421 sample post permalink]), and displays the message: <blockquote>Please enable javascript to use this site.</blockquote>

No content is displayed, AKA the '''[[js;dr]] problem'''.

This is in stark contrast to [[Twitter]] (which many GNU social instances are setup as replacements for), which displays just fine without JS.

As a stopgap, there is an invisible copy of the content marked up with [[microformats2]] and thus consumable by sites (e.g. indieweb sites and [[readers]])
* [http://pin13.net/mf2/?url=https://quitter.no/notice/1062421 mf2 JSON of above post permalink]

Further [https://quitter.no/notice/1086213 discussion] shows that this depends on configuration. [https://quitter.no/notice/1089026 Markup is being added] to the qvitter pages

== Criticisms ==
=== Difficult to get information about ===
Years ago, there was some confusion on IRC about StatusNet/pump/GNU social[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-11-02#t1383405690000], but that criticism doesn't really make sense anymore.

There is now an [https://karp.id.au/social/user/index.html unofficial user manual]

== History ==
* June 8th 2013, [http://www.gnu.org/software/social/merge.html GNU social] announced a merger with StatusNet and FreeSocial. Around ths time, identi.ca stopped accepting new registrations and transitioned active accounts to [[pump.io]].

* 2013 November: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160309165231/https://e14n.com/evan/note/1txE90HZTMSaf5EA6jxmAQ Evan began transitioning] (archive link) the remaining *.status.net  accounts to pump 
** original post <nowiki>https://e14n.com/evan/note/1txE90HZTMSaf5EA6jxmAQ</nowiki> offline

* ~2016-2017 The status.net domain itself was either sold, or expired, was squatted, and then sold to a company that is using it for self promotion that has nothing to do with OStatus or GnuSocial.
** to be added to: [[site-deaths]]
** number of *.status.net accounts lost? unknown
** number of *.status.net post permalinks lost? unknown

There continues to be an active community of StatusNet/GNU social users, many on quitter.se[http://quitter.se], though both pump.io ''and'' GNU social encourage users to host their own instances (to avoid becoming de facto centralized, as Identi.ca basically became).
