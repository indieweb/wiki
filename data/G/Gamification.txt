'''<dfn>Gamification</dfn>''' is applying the principles of game design to other software or services; some [[silos]] use gamification to encourage regular use of their apps and sites, and some such features could be implemented on personal sites to reinforce intentional behaviors.

Originally focused on usability, gamification is often a byword for dark patterns exploiting intermittent reinforcement and leader boards.

Examples of gamification features (alphabetical):
* [[badge]] — badges provided ("earned", "unlocked") as a reward for completing some action, thus incentivizing pursuing that action
* [[leaderboard]] — a leaderboard shows who on a service or site has done the most of some action or achieved the highest of some kind of score
* [[posting graph]] (including posts [[sparkline]]s) — line or bar chart or other graph showing recent post frequency/count per day or other time period
* [[streak]] — a streak is the repeated performance of some action (e.g. publishing a post, sending a message) at some regular frequency (e.g. daily), that is only recognized after some number of instances at that frequency, uninterrupted, e.g. after 5.
