== GoDaddy  ==
GoDaddy's mission is to radically shift the global economy toward life-fulfilling independent ventures, and as such, is in alignment with the [https://indieweb.org/principles principles of IndieWeb]

== Initial Efforts ==
In mid-2016, several members of GoDaddy's social media team began attending and evangelizing these principles internally. Myself, Stacey DePolo, began attending indieWeb Homebrew Club meetups in San Francisco, and eventually offered to host them in rotation with the usual location, Mozilla. 

Internally, I've been evangelizing IndieWeb principles, and have found that many internal stakeholders, including our Chief Product Officer, Steven Aldrich, to our CEO, Blake Irving, believe that making indieWeb principles part of our products are key to achieving our stated mission. 

Here's the current plan of action to make this partnership come to life:

1. discuss with team that builds our DIY product, [https://www.godaddy.com/websites/website-builder Website Builder] (completed August, 2016) <br>
2. pitch dev team in charge of GoDaddy's [https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting Managed WordPress] product (completed Nov. 2016) <br>
3. Initiate IndieWeb verification within GoDaddy Employee Advocates  (completed Oct. 2016, Noah Plumb, Isaac Irvine, Stacey DePolo have begun work) <br>
4. Contact authors of GoDaddy's WordPress theme  [https://github.com/godaddy/wp-primer-theme Primer] to pitch indieWebification of it. (pursuing December 2016)<br>
