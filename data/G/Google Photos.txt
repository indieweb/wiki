'''<dfn>Google Photos</dfn>''' is a [[js;dr]] [[photo]] [[silo]] hosted by [[Google]] that incorporates machine learning tools to organize and categorize uploaded photos, as well as generate presentations called 'stories' based on them.

== Data Export ==
At this time, Google permits easy access to download all of the photos uploaded into the service, however, this would be without the metadata it has generated to index it.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{gwg}} has recently(2015-11-13) begun using it as one of several places to back up photos also stored elsewhere, due to the advantages of automatic categorization.

== Issues ==
=== js-dr ===
Google Photos is [[js;dr]], it displays only a header, no content, without Javascript:
