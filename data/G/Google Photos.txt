{{stub}}
'''<dfn>Google Photos</dfn>''' is a [[js;dr]] [[photo]] [[silo]] hosted by [[Google]] that incorporates machine learning tools to organize and categorize uploaded photos, as well as generate presentations called 'stories' based on them.

Initially, Google Photos allowed unlimited "high quality" (16MP photos, 1080p videos) uploads with only original-quality uploads counting against your storage limits. Google announced [https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/] [http://web.archive.org/web/20201111235951/https://www.wired.com/story/google-photos-free-unlimited-storage-ends/] starting 2021-06-01, all new uploads would count toward the storage limit.

<blockquote>Starting June 1, 2021, any new photos and videos you upload will count toward the free 15 GB of storage that comes with every Google Account or the additional storage youâ€™ve purchased as a Google One member.</blockquote>

== Data Export ==
At this time, Google permits easy access to download all of the photos uploaded into the service, however, this would be without the metadata it has generated to index it.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{gwg}} has recently(2015-11-13) begun using it as one of several places to back up photos also stored elsewhere, due to the advantages of automatic categorization.

== Issues ==
=== js-dr ===
Google Photos is [[js;dr]], it displays only a header, no content, without Javascript:
