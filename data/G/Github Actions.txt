This can be used for [[Docker]] compose to create services on remote machines.

If you use GitHub for [[flat file storage]], you can use Github Actions for automated continuous [[deployment]] (CD) to your web host. Continuous deployment is a form of continuous integration (CI).

{{capjamesg}} uses GitHub Actions to deploy his personal website (jamesg.blog) and several other websites.

His GitHub Action setup has the following steps:

* Check out repository
* Set up Python
* Install dependencies (his SSG, [[Aurora]])
* Generate the site
* Upload pages with rsync

He keeps assets in a separate GitHub repository. This repository has its own action that uploads images with rsync.
