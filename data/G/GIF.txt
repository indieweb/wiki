'''<dfn>GIF</dfn>''' is a bitmap image format introduced by CompuServe in 1987 and often used for [[reaction]] posts. At one point it was one of only a few image formats available for [[photo|photos]] but due to file size and 256 color limit has been superseded by more modern formats. It lives on, particularly for [[88x31]] badges.

== Formats ==
Some other formats are used for short, silent, looping videos to achieve the same effect, even if they are not GIF format.
