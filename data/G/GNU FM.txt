[http://gnu.io/fm GNU FM] is a music community platform that is compatible with the Audioscrobbler API most commonly associated with [http://last.fm]. As of August 2014, the defacto GNU FM installation, [https://libre.fm] has been in production usage for over five years and has recorded over 98 million song listens. 

Planned social networking functionality was abandoned and eventually the [[GNU social]] project was spun off to create this.

GNU FM is federated, and we even federate with Last.fm.
