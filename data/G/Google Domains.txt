* {{gRegor}}: I tried it on 2017-07-21 to buy a new domain
** Really simple registration process
** DNS nameserver updates were also simple and propagated very quickly
** Over the following years, I moved most of my domains there from Domainmonster, partly because they were being acquired [https://www.internetnews.me/2017/04/10/domainmonster-no-customers-migrated-123-reg/] and I enjoyed the Google Domains experience 
* {{ds}} uses it and highly recommends it:
** clean, simple, minimal UI and pleasant user experience
* {{aciccarello}} used it on ciccarello.me for it's ease of setup, reasonable pricing, and simple email forwarding. Switched to [[NameCheap]] after the purchase by Squarespace was announced.
