'''<dfn>Google+</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Google Plus</dfn>, <dfn>GPlus</dfn>, or <dfn>G+</dfn>) is both a social content hosting [[silo]] operated by [[Google]], similar in many respects to [[Facebook]], and a centralized Google identity service for other Google services like [[YouTube]]. 

Google has integrated Google+ across many of their services, e.g. even Google's search shows a toolbar for it when signed into Google+.

Google announced they're shutting down consumer version end of August 2019:

== How to ==
=== How to export your data ===
[https://www.google.com/takeout/ Google Takeout] lets you download a zip with all of your Google+ posts, comments, pictures, etc. It's not linked directly from anywhere within Google+, and doesn't come up as a first search result for common queries, but works fantastically (if a bit slow).

[http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your posts to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and all comments intact.

=== How to POSSE to ===
There's currently no good way to automatically [[POSSE]] to Google+. Here are the (bad) options:
* Use the [https://developers.google.com/+/api/latest/moments Moments API]. As far as we know, though, it doesn't actually surface to users yet.
* Apply for the [https://developers.google.com/+/api/pages-signup partner-only Pages API].  ([http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-03-05/line/1425588204495 Requires signing an NDA.]) [https://withknown.com/pro/ Known Pro] uses this.
* Make a business relationship with Google so you can use a private/partner API, like [[WordPress]]'s [http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/ Jetpack Publicize]. [http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/google/ More] [https://twitter.com/justinshreve/status/411154097522233345 details]. Here's an example: [http://www.cogiddo.com/2013/12/test-post-for-the-new-integration-with-google/ original post], [https://plus.google.com/+DimitriosDiamantaras/posts/gyrwmds81hU Google+ post].
* Screen-scrape and use the web endpoints as if you were a normal user. [http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wordpress/ NextScripts SNAP] does this.

==== Why POSSE to ====
There is some evidence that Google+ "+1"s on links affect their search ranking:
* <span class="h-cite"><time class="dt-published">2013-08-20</time> <span class="p-publisher">The Moz Blog</span> / <span class="p-author h-card">Cyrus-Shepard</span>: <span class="p-name">Amazing Correlation Between Google +1s and Higher Search Rankings</span> (<cite class="u-url">http://moz.com/blog/google-plus-correlations</cite>)</span>
POSSEing links of your [[posts]] to Google+ may help increase +1s on them and thus increase their search ranking.

==== IndieWeb POSSE Examples ====
===== Will Norris =====
In <cite>[https://willnorris.com/2011/09/outsourcing-comments-to-google Outsourcing comments to Google+]</cite>, [[2011]] IndieWebCamp participant Will Norris explains how he uses 
* [https://willnorris.com/2011/09/launching-the-google-platform Google+ read API]
* [https://developers.google.com/+/web/+1button/ Google+ +1 button]
* in his [https://github.com/willnorris/wordpress-snowflake snowflake] plugin for [[WordPress]]
to <em>manually</em> create links to his blog posts on Google+ where he then accepts comments (instead of comments on his own blog).

This isn't a full POSSE implementation (which would be cross-posting the entirety of the contents of your blog posts to G+ posts), but rather just a way to manually share links/summaries of your original posts onto G+, similar to [[Twitter#POSSE_Articles_to_Twitter|POSSEing articles to Twitter]].

Manually POSSEs posts and replies to Google+
* Original post POSSE example (from 2014-05-26) : https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/technologies-ideas-action POSSE copy: https://plus.google.com/+KartikPrabhu/posts/GYxvUCwXC4y
* POSSE of a reply: https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/birth-of-idea-phone POSSE copy: https://plus.google.com/+LeoStein/posts/fBQeHxP8h2R#z135gpcygo2qebcj404chhhyzof0ubprel40k#1417402122646866

Google+ does not have URL permalinks for replies but does have an <code>id</code> attribute in the <code>div</code>. I copy the id to generate a syndication URL for my replies. Of course, G+ is kind enough to use javascript and ignore the id in the URL when the page is visited!

== Features ==
=== API ===
Google+ has a proprietary read API.
* https://willnorris.com/2011/09/launching-the-google-platform

=== +1 Button ===
{{main|+1 Button}}
Google+ allows you to put a "+1" button on any page that when clicked, does a "+1" (similar to a like) of your page, inside Google+, on the Google+ profile of whoever clicked the button.

=== Activities ===
Google+ has a proprietary Activities API that is based on (but not actually) [[ActivityStreams]]:
* https://developers.google.com/+/api/latest/activities

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to delete your account ===
TBD.

Has anyone deleted their G+ account? What's the process? How long do they hold your data anyway? Etc.

=== POSSE Events ===
Anecdotally there seems to be more interaction on G+ [[event]] posts than simple text posts.

If we can figure out a way to automatically create event posts on G+, it might be worth POSSEing indieweb event posts to G+.

=== Searchability ===
It's not obvious how to best publish/POSSE to or comment on G+ in a way that is most easily searchable / findable. Here are some tips:

* only post public posts to G+
* ...

== Issues ==
=== Lack of comment permalinks ===
[[Comments]] on Google+ lack their own permalinks, making it very difficult to reference a part of a conversation on a Google+ post.

It's apparently a "Known feature request that's never made it to the head of the priority queue." according to:
* https://plus.google.com/+AdeOshineye/posts/6zUWbNKbWrM

See also:
* http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-57405079-264/why-each-google-comment-should-get-its-own-web-address/

Similarly when asked at the 2013 Google I/O conference, Google+ representatives relayed the same message that it's a known feature request and there are still no plans for it.

=== Occasional IndieAuth login problems ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} had used Google+ for login via IndieAuth primarily until there were intermittent failings due to errors in redirects.    For example https://plus.google.com/113259788317081930920/posts redirects to https://plus.google.com/+BenRoberts83/posts but Google will occasionally change/break this routing.
