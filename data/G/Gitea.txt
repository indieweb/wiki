Unknown status.

Would be immediately useful (each of these needs an issue permalink (on GitHub (or at least POSSEd to) until the project moves) to describe and track support progress)

== Dogfooding ==
Goal: host Gitea the open source project on a Gitea instance.

Currently Gitea the open source project is on [[GitHub]] (instead of using Gitea itself for source control).

There is active work on fixing this however, so that Gitea the project [[dogfood]]s itself by being developed on a site running Gitea!

== History ==
* Gitea is a community fork of [[Gogs]], which forked late 2016/early 2017 due to perceived inactivity of the main projects maintainer: [https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/].
