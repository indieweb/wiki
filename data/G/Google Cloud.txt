'''<dfn>[https://cloud.google.com/ Google Cloud]</dfn>''' is a set of internet services from [[Google]], including [[Google App Engine]], Google Compute Engine, Google Container Engine and others.

== Issues ==
=== Billing issues very poorly handled ===
If you ever have billing problems (e.g. your credit card expires, or your credit card company proactively changes your credit card number, and you need to enter a new one into the "Google Developers Console"), Google Cloud is very bad about handling such issues and requires all kinds of privacy-violating actions.

Details documented at: http://bengo.is/notes/20151129-bengo-is-back

Note that in that case, even after providing all the privacy-violating documents, Google Cloud still failed to get back to him or restore his account.

Billing issues are common with any kind of paid subscription service, thus poor handling of them (or failure to handle them) are good enough reason to '''avoid using Google Cloud services for personal website hosting'''.
