'''<dfn>[https://gnunet.org/ GNUnet]</dfn>''' is a free software [[project]] for building applications with [[privacy]] by design. 

More technically, it is a open-source software [[framework]] for decentralized, peer-to-peer networking and an official GNU package. It is a network protocol stack for building secure, distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. It supports end-to-end encryption and is built to potentially replace the modern, but insecure, Internet.

GNUnet compliments some Indieweb [[principles]], and allows people to create or use applications to secure your data, whether it's used for payments, conversation, email or filesharing.
