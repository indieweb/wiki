=== IndieWeb CMS and Hosting ===
We have step-by-step tutorials that will get you all the way from an idea for a domain name to a full-fledged Indie Website with a few CMSs. [[Known]] or [[WordPress]] are the easiest. See the [[CMS]] page for more options.

=== Previous Services ===
Based on the experience of even fairly technical newcomers, it is too difficult and expensive and fragile to setup WordPress.com to work properly with IndieWeb features (even as simple as posting an [[RSVP]] to an event), so this is no longer recommended.

==== WordPress.com ====
[[WordPress.com]] is the hosted WordPress service. It too can be setup with some IndieWeb features, but also takes more work, and for some features may require a higher level of paid service.
