'''<dfn>[http://www.getgrav.org/ Grav]</dfn>''' is a [[flat-file]] [[CMS]] built on [[PHP]], with [[Twig]] templating, and [[YAML]] + [[Markdown]] for storing articles (YAML for metadata, Markdown for the content).

== Introduction ==

Grav uses its filesystem as a database, and heavily relies on [https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/performance-and-caching caching] (filesystem, memcache, redisâ€¦)

There's an [https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin admin] plugin with a nice user-interface which allows to:
* add/edit pages and articles
* configure the whole system and the plugins
* run updates and backups
* clear the cache manually
__TOC__
Grav is not a [[static site generator]], as it handles dynamic operations via plugins using an [https://learn.getgrav.org/plugins/grav-lifecycle eventing system]. Yet it is not a Wordpress-like CMS that renders all templates on every request, as it caches rendered templates (among others).

As a concept, Grav brings the best of both worlds. But the current implementation is far from scalable (Grav team recommends setups with at max a few thousand pages).

=== Pros ===

* Fast setup, amazing [https://learn.getgrav.org documentation]
* Nice responsive design
* Many useful plugins
* Multi-language support (url-based differenciation, support for language-based slugs)

=== Cons ===

* Dates are not translated
* Not optimized for big websites (1000s of pages), as building collections/taxonomies (categories, tags, events) requires parsing through all of the pages (can be made faster with SSDs, but still requires lots of RAM)

== Setup ==

You can find both the Grav core and a package with the Admin plugin in the [https://getgrav.org/downloads downloads section of the Grav site]. If you download the package, simply extract it, and point your web server there to be guided through setup.

Sample configuration files [https://github.com/getgrav/grav/tree/develop/webserver-configs are available] for nginx, caddy, Apache, IIS and lighttpd.

=== Updates ===

Updates can be made through the admin interface (from the main dashboard), or using the command-line tool, from your webroot : bin/gpm selfupgrade

=== Backups ===

Although backups are achievable through the web interface, data storage within Grav only relies on files, so making daily backups of your website can be as easy as a cron job running rdiff/rsync for the user/ folder in the webroot.

== Indieweb ==

=== IndieAuth ===

{{robertvanbregt}} has created a basic [http://github.com/metbril/grav-plugin-indieauth IndieAuth plugin] that will inject authentication and token endpoints into your homepage.

=== Microformats ===

The default [https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-antimatter Antimatter] theme supports basic microformats2 out-of-the-box. Support for h-feed name and description is available [https://github.com/paulcmal/grav-theme-antimatter/tree/feature-mf2-feed in a fork of the Antimatter theme]. The [https://github.com/Birssan/grav-plugin-about-me About Me plugin] adds additional information, including h-card on the home page and links to your identity in silos and other sites.

Themes and plugins generally provide full instructions for adding either via the command line or through the Grav admin interface.

==== More microformats ====

The [https://github.com/kalebheitzman/grav-plugin-events events] plugin has [https://github.com/paulcmal/grav-plugin-events a fork] adding microformats (no RSVP support yet).

=== Open Graph / Twitter Cards ===

To automatically generate og: and twitter: tags for your pages (can be overriden on a per-page basis), there's the [https://github.com/paulcmal/grav-plugin-socialmeta socialmeta] plugin.

===RSS===

OleVik has written a [https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-twigfeeds plugin that will display RSS feeds] in a Grav site. This can be useful for bringing in content from elsewhere.

=== Webmention ===

There is a [https://github.com/Perlkonig/grav-plugin-webmention Webmention plugin] marked as "beta", with [[Vouch]] support and a published [https://github.com/w3c/webmention/blob/master/implementation-reports/grav-plugin-webmention.md implementation report] against the specification.

{{jeremycherfas}}: <q>I tried using it and in the end gave up because the data it returned were so inconsistent, depending on the source markup. Tried to get it to use XRay instead but my ability wasn't up to it then.</q>

[[User:Rosemaryorchard.com]] is working on an improved plugin.

=== rel=me ===

{{robertvanbregt}} has created the [https://github.com/metbril/grav-plugin-relme Rel Me plugin] than can add [[rel-me]] links to a site.

=== Micropub ===
[[micropub]] is not (yet) supported natively or through a plugin. However, it should be feasible to create (a fork of) [[nanopub]]. [[User:Rosemaryorchard.com]] is working on an endpoint plugin.
