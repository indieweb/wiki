Google has shutdown a number of services (most recent first):
* 2016-01[https://web.archive.org/web/20160123173426/http://google.com/profiles/tantek] Google broke their original [[Google Profile]] URLs, e.g. this used to work in the [[Google Buzz]] days until 2015-12[https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065942/https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206], but now (2016-02-14) just 404s:
** http://google.com/profiles/tantek (with [[rel-me]] support too)

== Articles ==
Articles and blog posts critical of Google's behavior with respect to the open web, indieweb, open standards etc.:

* ...

== Search ==
{{main|Google Search}}

Google is primarily known for its dominant search engine.

=== Google Supports Microformats ===
{{main|Google_Search#Google_Supports_Microformats|Google Search: Supports Microformats}}
Google search will highlight results with [[microformats]] like those in IndieWeb [[posts]].

=== Google Web History ===
You can save your Google search history by explicitly turning on '''Google Web History'''
* https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/54068?hl=en&ref_topic=14148
And then look up your past Google searches:
* https://history.google.com/history/lookup (requires login)

=== Search History ===
Google collects your search history for the purpose of gathering data for ad serving.

They do this whether or not you are logged in (e.g. with cookies), and whether or not your have opted into Google Web History (see below), though you can also opt-out of all ad-customization.

There is something apparently that shows your demographic and psychographic buckets according to this data, but only at a high level. It should be browsable and searchable.

Apparently they scrub logs after somewhere between 6 and 18 months, and much of the extra details stored in history they don't store at all, or only temporarily (until the log savers get to it, i.e. days).
