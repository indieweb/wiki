Google has shutdown a number of services (most recent first):
* 2016-01[https://web.archive.org/web/20160123173426/http://google.com/profiles/tantek] Google broke their original [[Google Profile]] URLs, e.g. this used to work in the [[Google Buzz]] days until 2015-12[https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065942/https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206], but now (2016-02-14) just 404s:

== Search ==
Google is primarily known for its dominant search engine.

=== Google Web History ===
You can save your Google search history by explicitly turning on '''Google Web History'''
* https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/54068?hl=en&ref_topic=14148
And then look up your past Google searches:
* https://history.google.com/history/lookup (requires login)

=== Search History ===
Google collects your search history for the purpose of gathering data for ad serving.

They do this whether or not you are logged in (e.g. with cookies), and whether or not your have opted into Google Web History (see below), though you can also opt-out of all ad-customization.

There is something apparently that shows your demographic and psychographic buckets according to this data, but only at a high level. It should be browsable and searchable.

Apparently they scrub logs after somewhere between 6 and 18 months, and much of the extra details stored in history they don't store at all, or only temporarily (until the log savers get to it, i.e. days).

=== Aaron and Tantek met via Google Search ===
On 2009-09-23, IndieWebCamp co-founders Aaron Parecki and Tantek Ã‡elik met at an event Tantek organized, that Aaron found, via Googling for that date[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-29#t1401373878] and meetup san francisco[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-29#t1401374413] on the day of.

[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] was visiting San Francisco (from Portland), used Google on 2009-09-23 to search for meetups in San Francisco, and found:
* http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2009-09-23-weekly-dinner-sf

Aaron showed up, met a bunch of the microformats community in San Francisco:

Including Tantek. They kept up remotely and met again at the [[Federated Social Web Summit 2010]], which provided inspiration for them to co-found the IndieWebCamp community, and co-organize (with Amber Case and Crystal Beasley) the first IndieWebCamp two-day event in [[2011]].
