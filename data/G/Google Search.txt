'''<dfn>Google Search</dfn>''' is how [[Google]] started, a web search engine, and supports indexing and highlighting results with [[microformats]], like IndieWeb [[event]] posts.

[[Google]] is primarily known for its dominant search engine.

== Features ==
=== Google Supports Microformats ===
Google search will highlight results with microformats like those in IndieWeb posts.

==== Microformats OneBox ====
Publishing a page with [[microformats]] can cause it to show up in Google Searchâ€™s OneBox feature, e.g. here is an [[event]] that came from an IndieWeb event post when searching for just "indieweb events"

==== Event Search results ====
Click on the "Search more events" link in the above OneBox navigates to Google Event Search which shows more detailed results for the Indieweb event:

Note the cursor was hovering over the "ðŸŒŽ More Info" link in the right column which the status bar in the lower left indicates links to the original [[event]] post on tantek.com.

=== Google Web History ===
You can save your Google search history by explicitly turning on '''Google Web History'''
* https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/54068?hl=en&ref_topic=14148
And then look up your past Google searches:
* https://history.google.com/history/lookup (requires login)

=== Search History ===
Google collects your search history for the purpose of gathering data for ad serving.

They do this whether or not you are logged in (e.g. with cookies), and whether or not your have opted into Google Web History (see below), though you can also opt-out of all ad-customization.

There is something apparently that shows your demographic and psychographic buckets according to this data, but only at a high level. It should be browsable and searchable.

Apparently they scrub logs after somewhere between 6 and 18 months, and much of the extra details stored in history they don't store at all, or only temporarily (until the log savers get to it, i.e. days).

=== Aaron and Tantek met via Google Search ===
On 2009-09-23, IndieWebCamp co-founders Aaron Parecki and Tantek Ã‡elik met at an event Tantek organized, that Aaron found, via Googling for that date[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-29#t1401373878] and meetup san francisco[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-29#t1401374413] on the day of.

Including Tantek. They kept up remotely and met again at the [[Federated Social Web Summit 2010]], which provided inspiration for them to co-found the IndieWebCamp community, and co-organize (with Amber Case and Crystal Beasley) the first IndieWebCamp two-day event in [[2011]].
