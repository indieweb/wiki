== POSSE to GitHub ==
For [[POSSE]]ing source [[code]] to github, see [[git]].

While git is inherently distributed, all the extra functionality (issues, pull requests, etc.) that GitHub adds on top is not. GitHub [https://developer.github.com/v3/ has a nice API] for interacting with repositories, which makes it pretty easy to POSSE issues, comments on issues, stars, and maybe more.

=== POSSE note to GitHub ===
Plain text [[note]]s can be POSSEd to GitHub as a gist.

No known examples of anyone doing this yet. 

Be the first and add your permalinks here!

=== POSSE an issue ===
An [[issue]] post that is in reply to a particular GitHub repo can (and should) be POSSEd to GitHub as a new issue on that GitHub repo.

See examples of POSSEing issues to GitHub:
* [[issue#IndieWeb_Examples]]

=== POSSE reply to repo ===
A [[reply]] to a GitHub repo path, may make sense to be POSSEd as a comment on that path, e.g. if it is a gist. If the reply is an issue, see above [[#POSSE_an_issue|POSSE an issue]].

=== POSSE reply to issue ===
A [[reply]] to a specific GitHub issue can (and should) be POSSEd as a new comment on that issue.

If the GitHub issue was itself originally posted as an indie [[issue]], then be sure to post your [[reply]] as a [[multi-reply]] in-reply-to both that the indie issue permalink, and its GitHub copy.

=== POSSE reply to comment ===
A [[reply]] to a comment on a specific GitHub issue can (and should) be POSSEd as a comment in reply to that previous comment.

If that previous comment was itself originally posted as an indie [[reply]], then be sure to post your [[reply]] as a [[multi-reply]] in-reply-to both that previous indie reply permalink, and its GitHub copy. E.g.:
* indie multi-reply to a comment: http://tantek.com/2018/155/t1/
** POSSE copy: https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/3837#issuecomment-394545444

=== POSSE star of repo ===
A [[star]] on a GitHub repo can (and should) be POSSEd as a [[like]] of the repo.

=== POSSE reacji to issue or comment ===
A [[reacji]] to a GitHub issue or comment can (and should) be POSSEd as a reaction to that issue/comment on GitHub respectively.

If that GitHub issue or comment was itself originally posted on the indieweb, the be sure to post your [[reacji]] as a [[multi-reply]] in-reply-to both to the indie issue/reply post permalink and their GitHub copy.

=== Backfeed ===
If you POSSE to GitHub in any of the above ways, you should [[backfeed]] any replies on your post's GitHub POSSE copy back to your own post so that you can:
* keep a copy of people's comments on your post
* view follow-ups to your post on your post, instead of having to visit GitHub's site
* reply to follow-ups to your post, from your site, instead of using GitHub's UI

[[Bridgy]] [https://brid.gy/about#which backfeed supports]:
* comments on issues and PRs
* emoji reactions to issues and PRs

Additional backfeed to consider implementing
* [[tag-of]]: username1 added the abc label n hours[or days] ago
* [[untag-of]]: username1 removed the abc label n hours[or days] ago
* ????: closed this in linkedPullRequest n hours[or days] ago

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}} is automatically [[POSSE]]ing comments on GitHub issues from his own site to GitHub using [[silo.pub]] (as of YYYY-MM-DD), and before that was manually POSSEing. E.g.:
* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/08/14/6/mailpile (original)
** https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/issues/48#issuecomment-22682787 (manual POSSE copy on GitHub)
At some point Aaron switched to using [[silo.pub]] to POSSE to GitHub
*... need aaronparecki.com permalink of an issue/comment post in reply to github (preferably first such link after implementing silo.pub auto-POSSE to GitHub)
** ... need POSSE copy github.com permalink (that was published with silo.pub)

==== Colin Tedford ====
[[User:Colintedford.com|Colin Tedford]] manually POSSEs Github issues, and manually POSSEs and backfeeds comments on GitHub issues (it's just occasional bug reports, so not as onerous as it might be if he were a developer).
* http://colintedford.com/2015/02/02.0338-easy-syntax-not-working/ (original, w/ comments)
** https://github.com/glensc/dokuwiki-plugin-pageredirect/issues/18 (POSSE copy on Github)

==== Chris Aldrich ====
{{chrisaldrich}} is occasionally automatically POSSEing comments on GitHub issues from his Known site to GitHub. E.g.:
* original: http://stream.boffosocko.com/2017/miklb-i-would-generally-agree-with-you-but-im-thinking 
** POSSE: https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-post-kinds/issues/84#issuecomment-292446828

He does this with the [[Known]] plugin to POSSE to GitHub.

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} is POSSEing to GitHub using [[Bridgy]] Publish [http://tantek.com/2018/052/t2/monday-github-issue-comments-indieweb since 2018-02-19]:
* comments on GitHub issues ([http://tantek.com/2018/050/t1/authorize-bridgy-prompt since 2018-02-19], [http://tantek.com/2018/052/t2/monday-github-issue-comments-indieweb post about])
* new GitHub issues ([http://tantek.com/2018/052/b1/bridgy-github-support-images-hyperlinks since 2018-02-21], [http://tantek.com/2018/052/t4/monday-github-issues-indieweb post about]) {{main|issue#Tantek}}
* replies to comments on GitHub issues ([http://tantek.com/2018/052/t1/ab-term-limits-issue since 2018-02-21])
* multi-reply to an indie [[reply]] to a GitHub issue and its POSSE copy:
** http://tantek.com/2018/155/t1/
** POSSE copy: https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/3837#issuecomment-394545444
* reactions to GitHub comments ([http://tantek.com/2018/055/t1/thumbs-up since 2018-02-24]) 
* reactions to GitHub issues ([http://tantek.com/2018/057/t1/thumbs-up since 2018-02-26])
* reactions to GitHub pull requests ([http://tantek.com/2018/190/t1/ since 2018-07-09], same code as reactions to comments & issues)

=== Bridgy ===
[[Bridgy]] can [https://brid.gy/about#publish-types POSSE issues, comments, stars, and emoji reactions to GitHub], as well as [https://brid.gy/about#which backfeed comments and reactions].

If you get an error POSSEing to a particular GitHub repo using Bridgy, you may need to ask the repo's organization's owner(s) to approve Bridgy as an OAuth app for that repo.

See and refer them to: https://help.github.com/articles/approving-oauth-apps-for-your-organization/

=== Known ===
[[Known]] has a plugin for automatic POSSEing to GitHub:
* https://github.com/mapkyca/KnownGithub

=== Silopub ===
* [[silo.pub]] supports creating issues, commenting on issues and pull requests, and starring repositories since [https://kylewm.com/2016/04/i-launched-github-support-on-silo-pub-this-morning 2016-04-22]

== Porting to the IndieWeb ==
Example github activity [[Atom]] [[feed]] whereby you can export or [[PESOS]] your activities from:
* https://github.com/tantek.atom (for account name "tantek")

If you want a feed of activity by others on your repositories, it looks like you can get it through your "Personal News Feed". "Your personal News Feed shows activity‚Äîother than your own!‚Äîon repositories you watch. [&hellip;] To subscribe to your personal News Feed in your favorite RSS reader, click Subscribe to News Feed under your list of repositories." https://help.github.com/articles/news-feed/

== Using Github for comments ==
Some people use Github to gather comments for their blog posts. For each post, an issue is opened. Comments are fetched via the Github API and displayed below the blog post

Examples:

* http://donw.io/post/github-comments/
* [https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/speed-up-laravel-tests-with-database-transactions/ jordaneldredge.com blog post] and comment-tracking issue [https://github.com/captbaritone/jordaneldredge.com/issues/9 jordaneldredge.com#9]

== OAuth UI ==
If you deploy an application that uses GitHub's API and needs to request the user's permission, it will display an OAuth permissions page that looks like *you* (the author of the application) are asking permission.

E.g. [[Bridgy]]'s GitHub permission initially had a "Authorize snarfed" green button (fixed shortly thereafter, says "Authorize bridgy" [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/333#issuecomment-367853218 since 2018-02-20])

[[File:2018-02-09-github-bridgy-auth-snarfed.png]]

(Old example from 2018-02-09.)

The solution is to deploy the application from a GitHub organization account for your application, either with the same name as your application, or whatever organization your application is a part of, that you're asking your users to "trust".

[[Bridgy]] for GitHub now does this ("Authorize bridgy" green button), using the https://github.org/bridgy organization. Example prompt below with updated green button. The real prompt has the real logo and omits "local" / "localhost:8080":

[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/333#issuecomment-367853218 <img style="max-width:100%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/778068/36569186-a4f00d52-17e1-11e8-8989-841c09db906e.png" alt="Authorize bridgy screenshot"/>]

== Feature Details ==
=== Account Recovery ===
As part of GitHub's Account Recovery feature, starting ~ 2018-07-18, GitHub started putting in a forced interstitial to confirm you account recovery settings, e.g. a page with something like this as its entire content:

[[File:2018-204-github-recovery-interstitial.png]]

Any attempt to load a GitHub URL (assuming you were previously logged in) would result in a temporary redirect to that interstitial. You could still view public GitHub URLs in a browser's "Private Mode" without seeing the interstitial (because you were not logged in).

'''Note:''' DO NOT ''only'' use "Fallback SMS number" as an account recovery mechanism, for all the reasons documented on the [[SMS]] page (tl;dr, SMS is horribly insecure, and fairly trivial for a professional to attack - has already happened to numerous people.)

== Self-hosted alternatives ==
{{main|git#Software}}

There are some self-hosted alternatives to GitHub. Gitlab and Gogs support issue tracking and project management as well.

* [[GitLab]]: full-featured GitHub replacement
* [[Gogs]]: full-featured GitHub replacement
* [http://gitolite.com/ Gitolite]: web interface for managing repositories, with fine-grained access controls 
* [https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb Gitweb]: simple web interface for browsing git repositories 
* Formerly [[Gitorious]] (acquired by GitLab in March 2015)
* Formerly Gitosis ([http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Gitosis#Note deprecated] long ago in favor of gitolite)
* [https://gitea.io/ Gitea]: Golang, lightweight alternative with many common features

== Issues ==
=== Account reuse is potential security issue ===
2018-02-07 GitHub allows account deletion, recreation by another party, with library dependency:

== Criticism ==
=== DMCA harassment ===
You can lose your data due to unjustified DMCA takedowns:
* [https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014-07-02-Qualcomm.md Takedown] and [http://ausdroid.net/2014/07/05/qualcomm-retracts-dmca-takedown-request-apologises-involved/ Apology]
* Github has since improved this process by defining how they are handled better, specifically allowing for the owner to make needed corrections or to move hosts. https://github.com/blog/1908-a-better-dmca-process
=== DDoS collateral damage ===
Github is sometimes the target of DDoS attacks, apparently targeted at specific projects. While GitHub seems to be handling the attacks in such a way as to keep access working, this is a vulnerability of any centralized service, that it attracts attacks unrelated to your use of it, that jeopardize your use of it (collateral damage). Most recent first

* 2016-10-21 DDos attack on [[DYN]] affects [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/ Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, GitHub], effectively taking them all offline.

* 2015-03-26 DDoS attack [https://github.com/blog/1981-large-scale-ddos-attack-on-github-com] via unsuspecting browsers executing scripts from ([[MitM]]) faked [[Baidu]] requests[http://insight-labs.org/?p=1682].

=== March 2017 Terms of Service Update ===
In March 2017, GitHub updated their terms of service. Several people are upset about the change, which may affect GPL and similarly licensed software.

=== Contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ===
Renewed a $200,000 USD contract with ICE in 2019

}}
* The CEO defended the decision, despite the amount not being ‚Äúfinancially material for the company.‚Äù <blockquote>‚ÄúWhile ICE does manage immigration law enforcement, including the policies that both GitHub and Microsoft are on record strongly opposing, they are also on the front lines of fighting human trafficking, child exploitation, terrorism and transnational crime,‚Äù he wrote, adding that the company would donate $500,000 to non-profits working to combat the effects of Trump‚Äôs immigration policies. As of now, the money has not yet been donated.</blockquote>
* <blockquote>Friedman‚Äôs response has outraged many employees. Nearly 25 percent of the company has signed onto an open letter demanding Friedman cancel the contract, including half of the engineering department.</blockquote>

* <blockquote>‚ÄúWe are not satisfied with GitHub‚Äôs now-public stance on this issue,‚Äù GitHub employees wrote in an open letter. ‚ÄúGitHub has held a ‚Äòseat at the table‚Äô for over 2 years, as these illegal and dehumanizing policies have escalated, with little to show for it. Continuing to hold this contract does not improve our bargaining power with ICE. All it does is make us complicit in their widespread human rights abuses.‚Äù</blockquote>

== Downtime ==
Occassionally GitHub fails to handle requests:

=== 2016-07-26 Server Unavailable ===
[[File:2016-07-26-github-no-server-available.png]]

<blockquote>No server is currently available to service your request.<br/><br/>Sorry about that. Please try refreshing and contact us if the problem persists.</blockquote>


=== 2018-10-21 Degraded Service ===
2018-10-21 GitHub experienced over 24 hours of what they called "Degraded Service".
* Details: 2018-10-30: GitHub Blog [https://blog.github.com/2018-10-30-oct21-post-incident-analysis/ October 21 post-incident analysis]
During that time GitHub was effectively "down" for many users and use-cases.
* Pages (issues/pull requests) not loading
* Pages (issues/pull requests) out of date
* Editing issues not working
