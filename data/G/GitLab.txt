'''<dfn>[https://about.gitlab.com GitLab]</dfn>''' (available in multiple versions but primarily Community Edition and Enterprise Edition) is a [[:Category:Software Forge|software forge]] that offers [[git]] repository management, code reviews, issue tracking, activity feeds and wikis. 

'''GitLab Community Edition''' is an open source project that provides many of the features of [[GitHub]]. You install it on your own server or pay a service provider to do it for you. GitLab also includes [[gitlab-pages|GitLab Pages]], a service to build and host static websites.

'''GitLab.com''' is a hosted version of GitLab Enterprise Edition (proprietary). Also offers enterprise support and repository hosting. 

== IndieWeb Friendly ==

GitLab.com supports the following IndieWeb [[building blocks]]:
* [[rel=me]] on user profiles on links to your own site, e.g. see https://gitlab.com/Mikaela which has a rel=me link to https://mikaela.info/

== IndieWiki Examples ==

* {{mat.tl}} has been a longtime GitLab user (for Libre.fm) and a GitLab CE and EE administrator.

* {{addyourself}}

* Helpful discussion of setting up GitLab with [[Docker]] and subsequent  memory issues. Concludes "After this experience it is apparent that neither gitlab nor docker is really ready for primetime."



== Issues ==
=== Loss of data (on GitLab.com) ===
<blockquote>
We also lost some production data that we were eventually unable to recover. Specifically, we lost modifications to database data such as projects, comments, user accounts, issues and snippets, that took place between 17:20 and 00:00 UTC on January 31. Our best estimate is that it affected roughly 5,000 projects, 5,000 comments and 700 new user accounts.
