'''<dfn>Google Contacts</dfn>''' is perhaps the worst "popular" web-based contacts [[UI]] / addressbook service in existence that does such horrible things as overriding cmd-F (page search) to activate the search text box instead, and fails to autoparse simple name <emailaddress> shorthands like you might copy from the Gmail UI.
