'''<dfn>[https://glitch.com/ Glitch]</dfn>''' (formerly <dfn>Gomix</dfn>, <dfn>HyperDev</dfn> before that) is a tool allowing you to quickly prototype [[web application]]s in a complete IDE with built in version control, sharing, [https://glitch.com/help/kb/article/9-how-do-i-add-a-custom-domain-a-cname-or-a-record-for-my-custom-domain/ custom domain support], and more.

It works similar to a CodePen or Gist but it allows you to write a [[Node.js]]-based server to complement the front end.

It's made by Glitch Inc, formerly known as Fog Creek Software.
