'''<dfn>[http://github.com GitHub Pages]</dfn>''' is a static [[content hosting service]].

__TOC__
GitHub's <dfn>GitHub Pages</dfn> (gh-pages) feature is a [[web_hosting#Static_domain_hosting|static domain hosting]] where you can host your static sites. They offer pre-built web page templates, as well as the ability to build and host [[Jekyll]] websites.

== Why ==
Static content hosting is a form of [[web hosting]] that can be used for [[getting started]] on the IndieWeb.

=== Advantages ===
* An advantage to using a GitHub based solution is that you can easily transfer it to another web host simply by deploying from GitHub to your web host.

== How ==
=== Easy Start ===
The simplest way to get started with GitHub pages is:
* Go https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site and follow the instructions there.

=== domain related configuration ===
* [https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/ configure your domain for Github Pages] 
** ''Note:'' when you add your custom domain to your settings page, this will automatically create a CNAME file
** ''Additionally,''  on your domain configuration page, add these two custom resource records to your DNS: an “@” type A records that points to the GitHub IPv4 address 192.30.252.153  and a “www” CNAME record that points to your USERNAME.github.io url.
* [https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/ enable HTTPS support]
** See also: [https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/#https-errors Custom domains: HTTPS Errors]

=== Guides ===
There are several more involved guides on how (and approaches) to use GitHub Pages to host your website:
* [[Jekyll]],  http://jekyllrb.com/, is enabled by default on GitHub Pages, but you can also build locally and push to GitHub.

* Example: [http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/08/11/now-powered-by-jekyll-and-github-pages/ BootStrap blog powered by Jekyll and GitHub pages]
* Jekyll IndieWeb [https://http://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb | IndieWeb ready Jekyll project] Microformats 2 ready, support for h-card in config file, receive webmentions

=== Fork and go ===
Some websites provide ready-to-fork repositories that one can use to get started. These *don't* have to be used with GitHub, but they are configured to use GitHub pages by default.

* [http://octopress.org/ Octopress] provides a rich website construction toolkit, based on top of Jekyll.
* [http://pjf.id.au/ pjf.id.au] has his entire website under CC-BY, with a branch on github specifically for forking the design and build process. Like Octopress, it uses Jekyll underneath. See the [https://github.com/pjf/pjf.github.io github repo] for details.
* [[coisas]] is a browser-based CMS that works only with GitHub Pages, it has a [http://github.com/fiatjaf/coisas-template template] that can be forked from the website UI, and then worked on without need of ever touching the command line.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

== Limitations ==
=== No HTTP Status Code Control ===
gh-pages does not allow you to setup custom HTTP [status] return codes. -bret (in IRC 2013-176, unlogged).

If a page exists, GitHub Pages will return "200 OK"

If a page does not exist, or was deleted, GitHub Pages will return "404 Not Found"

For some as yet unknown reason, GitHub Pages will return a 301 redirect to the same URL on the first request to a page in a "while". On subsequent requests, it will return the actual page content.

There is ongoing discussion on using http-equiv codes to work around limitations like these.
See: [[deleted#Brainstorming]]

===Limited file types===
GitHub isn't a very good host for large media files, especially if they change, although there is nothing stopping you from uploading media.  Only serve files from gh-pages, as raw repository links have to come out of some application layer, and thus are slower to retrieve.  Github enforces a soft repository [https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota size limit of about 1Gb].

===Jekyll Safe Mode===
If you wish for GitHub to build your [[Jekyll]] website for you on their server, you must conform to the [https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages restrictions associated with jekyll safe mode], which means no plugins.  You can pre-process with as many plugins as you want and upload raw html files instead as a simple workaround (similar to how [[octopress]] works).

== Criticism ==
As Github Pages is part of [[Github]], it suffers from the same weakness - see the [[Github]] page for details about them.
