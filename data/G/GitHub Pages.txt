'''<dfn>[https://pages.github.com/ GitHub Pages]</dfn>''' (aka gh-pages) is a static [[content hosting service]] offered by [[GitHub]] where you can host your static sites. They offer pre-built web page templates, as well as the ability to build and host [[Jekyll]] websites.

== Why ==
[[web_hosting#Static_domain_hosting|Static content hosting]] is a form of [[web hosting]] that can be used for [[getting started]] on the IndieWeb.
__TOC__

=== Advantages ===
* An advantage to using a GitHub based solution is that you can easily transfer it to another web host simply by deploying from GitHub to your web host.

== How ==
=== Easy Start ===
The simplest way to get started with GitHub pages is:
* Go https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site and follow the instructions there.

=== domain related configuration ===
* [https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/ configure your domain for Github Pages] 
** ''Note:'' when you add your custom domain to your settings page, this will automatically create a CNAME file
** ''Additionally,''  on your domain configuration page, add these two custom resource records to your DNS: an “@” type A records that points to the GitHub IPv4 address 192.30.252.153  and a “www” CNAME record that points to your USERNAME.github.io url.
* [https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/ enable HTTPS support]
** See also: [https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/#https-errors Custom domains: HTTPS Errors]

=== Guides ===
There are several more involved guides on how (and approaches) to use GitHub Pages to host your website:
* [[Jekyll]],  http://jekyllrb.com/, is enabled by default on GitHub Pages, but you can also build locally and push to GitHub.
* http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/extras/github-pages.html
* Example: [http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/08/11/now-powered-by-jekyll-and-github-pages/ BootStrap blog powered by Jekyll and GitHub pages]
* [http://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb IndieWeb ready Jekyll project] Microformats 2 ready, support for h-card in config file, receive webmentions

=== Fork and go ===
Some websites provide ready-to-fork repositories that one can use to get started. These *don't* have to be used with GitHub, but they are configured to use GitHub pages by default.

* [http://octopress.org/ Octopress] provides a rich website construction toolkit, based on top of Jekyll.
* [http://pjf.id.au/ pjf.id.au] has his entire website under CC-BY, with a branch on github specifically for forking the design and build process. Like Octopress, it uses Jekyll underneath. See the [https://github.com/pjf/pjf.github.io github repo] for details.
* [[coisas]] is a browser-based CMS that works only with GitHub Pages, it has a [http://github.com/fiatjaf/coisas-template template] that can be forked from the website UI, and then worked on without need of ever touching the command line.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
* Starting on 2020-04-02 {{chrisaldrich}} has a secondary website built on [[TiddlyWiki]] that uses GitHub Pages for hosting. He's detailed the process at [https://boffosocko.com/2020/04/04/self-hosting-tiddlywiki-with-github-pages/ Self-hosting TiddlyWiki with GitHub Pages]

== Limitations ==
=== No HTTP Status Code Control ===
gh-pages does not allow you to setup custom HTTP [status] return codes. -bret (in IRC 2013-176, unlogged).

If a page exists, GitHub Pages will return "200 OK"

If a page does not exist, or was deleted, GitHub Pages will return "404 Not Found"

For some as yet unknown reason, GitHub Pages will return a 301 redirect to the same URL on the first request to a page in a "while". On subsequent requests, it will return the actual page content.

There is ongoing discussion on using http-equiv codes to work around limitations like these.
See: [[deleted#Brainstorming]]

===Limited file types===
GitHub isn't a very good host for large media files, especially if they change, although there is nothing stopping you from uploading media.  Only serve files from gh-pages, as raw repository links have to come out of some application layer, and thus are slower to retrieve.  Github enforces a soft repository [https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota size limit of about 1Gb].

===Jekyll Safe Mode===
If you wish for GitHub to build your [[Jekyll]] website for you on their server, you must conform to the [https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages restrictions associated with jekyll safe mode], which means no plugins.  You can pre-process with as many plugins as you want and upload raw html files instead as a simple workaround (similar to how [[octopress]] works).

== Brainstorming ==
=== Setup your personal domain ===
The instructions to [https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/ configure your domain for Github Pages] are quite lengthy, confusing, and spread across multiple pages, this section is a simplification of those instructions for the common case of a personal domain.

Simpler step-by-step instructions:
# From your *.github.io page, choose "⚙︎ Settings" near the top, then "Pages" from the left column
# Scroll down to where it says "Custom domain" and enter your domain name like "example.com" (no "www." and no "/" at the end)
#* You might see an error/warning like a red ⚠️ triangle next to your domain, or an error like: <blockquote>'''Both example.com and its alternate name are improperly configured''' ( Check again )  <br/>Domain does not resolve to the GitHub Pages server. For more information, see Learn more (NotServedByPagesError). We recommend you add an A record pointed to our IP addresses, or an ALIAS record pointing to YOURUSERNAME.github.io.</blockquote>
#* Do not worry about this, GitHub itself says <blockquote>Make sure you add your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site before configuring your custom domain with your DNS provider.</blockquote>
# Go to the DNS configuration page for your domain (example.com) on your provider
# Change the "DNS Time To Live" (TTL) to 60 seconds (some providers may set a floor of 600)
# Edit existing "A" records (or create new ones if necessary) to enter GitHub’s IP addresses <blockquote>185.199.108.153 <br/>185.199.109.153 <br/>185.199.110.153 <br/>185.199.111.153 </blockquote>For the latest, see step 5 in [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain in this section] where it says "To create A records, …" and copy each line of dot-separated numbers that look like "185.199.108.153" into its own "A record"
# Click the ( Check again ) button in the red background warning on your GitHub settings just under the "Custom Domain" setting. (this may or may not work, depending on how many A records you edited)
# Wait anywhere from a few minutes to a day (depending on what your "TTL" was set to) and reload your domain "example.com"

== Criticism ==
As Github Pages is part of [[Github]], it suffers from the same weakness - see the [[Github]] page for details about them.
