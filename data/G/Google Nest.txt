'''<dfn>Google Nest</dfn>''' is a home security system sold by [[Google]] that was recently discovered to have a hidden undisclosed microphone to be activated by a centralized software update, and questioned by United States Senators about why it had not informed customers about it, perhaps a good reason to setup an IndieWeb based home security system instead.
