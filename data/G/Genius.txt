'''<dfn>[http://genius.com/web-annotator News Genius]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] that allows users to highlight and [[annotation|annotate]] any webpage by prefixing it with http://genius.it/, or using plugin or bookmarklet, and is being [[#Criticism|widely criticized]] for enabling harassment of smaller (indieweb) sites.

== Blocking ==
* Savant: A [https://github.com/kevinmarks/savant script] to redirect from a [genius.it] wrapped page to the original url. [http://genius.it/8883931/news.genius.com Discussion on their site]
* Genius Defender: An [http://www.vijithassar.com/2641/how-to-block-genius-annotations approach] that poisons the page with unicode invisible separators. 
** Looking at [https://github.com/vijithassar/genius-defender/blob/master/genius-defender.php#L9 the code] this is an O(n^2) process on your site that expands it by a factor of 10 in length (yes gzip will help) that can be reversed with a O(n) regex to filter them out again. Not recommended.

== Criticism ==
The site works by proxying the original page, with the user's Browser signature, and injecting javascript to enable annotation. It puts in a base tag that makes relative css and script work, but not code that uses window.location, so breaks the webmentions on eg [http://genius.it/kevinmarks.com kevinmarks.com]

It does not respect robots.txt so an author cannot block annotation of their site. 

[http://glog.glennf.com/blog/2016/3/25/citation-appropriation-and-fair-use Glenn Fleishman]:
<blockquote>The Genius Web Annotator is a hybrid of citation and appropriation that doesn't respect the source's owner nor have any mechanism to opt out or block it. The site retrieves the original page through a proxy server and then rewrites it with added JavaScript, which lets it overlay its commentary tool. I wrote the company earlier in the week through its general feedback form asking about how to opt my sites out. I've received no response so far.</blockquote>

[https://ellacydawson.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/how-news-genius-silences-writers/ Ella Dawson]:
<blockquote>Although the coverage of News Genius praises it as a feature hosts can code into their site, anyone can lay comments on anything by adding some language to a URL address. That is the entire point: according to the annotator’s Twitter bio, “The Genius Web Annotator lets you add line-by-line annotations to any page on the Internet.” Because my blog is currently a free WordPress website, anyone can use Genius to annotate my posts without my control. It is not opt-in for the creator, and if I want to engage with the annotations, I have to sign in using a Genius account. I see no way to report an annotation for abuse or harassment—perhaps that is only available for users?—and I see no way to block a user from annotating my content. 

Genius is officially worse than Twitter: I can block a user on Twitter, and they can then go and scribble whatever they want on my website using Genius.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There are dangers in painting with broad strokes. Treating large news orgs with the same software as independent bloggers seems a little shortsighted.
If the focus of the company is to hold large news orgs accountable, why not implement a whitelist of large, high traffic news organization domains and offer an opt-in option for independent bloggers who want it as their comments system of choice?</blockquote>

Now it can’t pay back its investors.</blockquote>
