The '''<dfn>Gillmor Gang</dfn>''' is a [http://techcrunch.com/video/gillmor-gang/ weekly podcast] hosted by [http://techcrunch.com/author/steve-gillmor/ Steve Gillmor] who has perennially discussed topics relating to the bleeding edge of web technology as they relate to social media, journalism, and modern life.

IndieWeb maven {{kevinmarks}} is a regular guest on the show and frequently touches on how the IndieWeb movement overlaps these topic areas.

Favorite topics on the show include the real-time web, notifications, news consumption, mobile, RSS, as well as technology companies Apple, Google, and Microsoft. 

Seemingly Gillmor has eschewed RSS (possibly in favor of real-time), so the best place to find RSS copies of the show is on [[Huffduffer]].

Steve Gillmor is also the brother of journalist [http://dangillmor.com/ Dan Gillmor], an IndieWeb member who utilizes pieces of it including the [[microformats]]2 capable Sempress theme on his primary site run on [[WordPress]].
