== Data Export ==

* Go to the [https://www.garmin.com/en-US/account/datamanagement/exportdata/ “Export your data” page] and request a copy of your data. The ZIP file you will get via e-mail contains every data point Garmin has saved about you. More details about the data format can be found in the blog post [https://francescoschwarz.com/articles/running-on-my-own/ “Running on my own”].
* You can also use [https://tapiriik.com/ tapiriik] (for free) to sync GPS files between a number of destinations, including a Dropbox folder.
** This will not sync manually created activities.
* Alternatively, on the Garmin Connect page under “Analyze” -> “Activities”, you can select all activities and click on “Export to CSV” (in the bottom left corner). This only exports the current page of activities, not all activities.
