'''<dfn>Get started</dfn>''' on the [[indieweb]] by connecting with the IndieWeb community, getting a personal domain, a place for your content, and setting up your home page and other IndieWeb essentials.

Do the reasons '''[[why]]''' resonate with you, but you are not sure how to get on the IndieWeb? 

You have found the right page!

With each step below, you will gain understanding and more ownership of your online identity &amp; content, steadily making progress with your personal web presence.

At some point along the way, you may want to participate the community by joining [[discuss|👥 our chat room]], attending a 📅 [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetup, or going to the next 🎪 [[next-iwc|IndieWebCamp]] weekend.

== Get Your Own Site ==
This is the key to being on and a part of the [[IndieWeb]]:
* Get your own domain
* Set up your hosting
* Create your pages

=== Get Your Domain ===
You need your own [[personal domain]] to use as your primary online identity:
* '''Get your own personal domain name''' from a [[domain name registrar]] 
* '''Choose your privacy level''' - Most domain name registrars will make your personal information publicly available (name, mailing address, phone number, email address), but many registrars offer domain privacy options, so that instead of your personal details the registrar's details will be in the public whois directory. Only use domain privacy options if you fully trust the provider of the service, since disputes about domain name administration or transfers may get tricky if you are not listed as the legal owner of the domain.

=== Set Up Hosting ===
[[web hosting|Web hosting]] is how you put your website online. You can use a web hosting service, which is recommended for beginners, or you can [[self hosting|self host]] on your own device, which is generally considered more challenging.

Examples of web host services:
* [[GitHub Pages]]
* [[gitlab-pages|GitLab Pages]]
* [[DreamHost]]
* [[NeoCities]]
* [[Netlify]]
* [[NearlyFreeSpeech.NET]]

=== Create Your Pages ===
The actual pages or content of your website can be created in a variety of ways. Some popular options are the use of '''[[static site generator|static site generators (SSGs)]]''', writing '''[[HTML]]''', or using a '''[[CMS|Content Management Service (CMS)]]'''. For blogging, you can also look at [[Dreamwidth]], [[Micro.blog]] ([[Tutorial_Set_up_micro_dot_blog |Tutorial]]), or [[Blogger]] ([[Tutorial Set_up_an_Indie_Website_using_Blogger|Tutorial]]). 

Optionally, you may want to import your content from other accounts or platforms. For more information, see [[export#Silos|Export: Silos]] or the wiki pages for specific sites, such as [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Facebook]].

=== Syndicate Elsewhere ===
{{main|POSSE}}
[[syndication-models|Syndication]] or [[cross-posting]] means to share your posts across multiple sites. You may want to set up automatic syndication so that material posted to your site is automatically distributed to your social media accounts, or you can cross-post manually. 

Putting material on your own site first and linking to it elsewhere is called [[POSSE]], which is short for Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. By setting up POSSE, you can have your posts pushed to specific social media [[silos]] with a personal [[permalink]] back to the original on your own site. In other words, you allow those that read content on those silos to continue seeing what you have to say, while you retain ownership and control of your content on your own site.

=== Use Microformats ===
When setting up your [[home page]] (<code>index.html</code>), you can include [[rel-me]] links to your social network profiles in order to confirm those accounts are yours. If your links are set up correctly (test with [https://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me/ the IndieWebify.Me Web Sign In Validator]), this will also allow you to sign in to sites that support [[IndieAuth]] — like this wiki! For more information, see [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain|setup web sign-in]].

On blogposts and articles, you can add the [[h-entry]] microformat markup to your posts in order to help automated tools display your author information, which can be useful for indie web [[comments]], [[likes]], [[reposts]], and [[reply-context]]. You can use the [https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/ h-entry validator] to verify that your h-entry has been set up correctly.

=== Use Tools ===
[https://indiewebify.me/ 🔧 Indiewebify.me] provides step-by-step guidance and tools to test & validate your progress. See [[Tools]] for more useful things for building & debugging an IndieWeb site.

== Join The Community ==
* Share what you did / discovered in the process of building your IndieWeb site, even if it is only a single page, with a simple design.
* Ask what you can/should do next in the [[discuss]]ion channels.
* Check the list of [[events]] and join us at the next [[IndieWebCamp]] or [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetup!
* Once you can use [[IndieAuth]] or log into the wiki, [[wikifying#How_to_Join_the_IndieWeb_Wiki|create your user page]] by wikifying yourself.
* Document what you've done and add your site and details to the IndieWeb examples section of relevant pages to share what and how you've done it with others.

== Brainstorming ==
This section is for collecting various ideas and proposals for improving this page, and seeing which gather sufficient "+1" support from the community make some incremental improvements.

* Proposal: Consider re-organizing top level into:
** Get on the IndieWeb
** How will my friends see my posts?
** How will I see posts by my friends?
** +1 {{t}}
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

=== Resolved ===
<s>
* Proposal: Split "IndieWeb self-starters" into two sections on "CMS hobbyists" and "Web Developers" because "self-starter" still implies too much ease of entry/use
** +1 {{t}}

* Criticism / challenges of using/publishing tutorials as a method of helping beginners [[get started]]: tutorials go out of date without people actively maintaining them, and then can frustrate or at least disillusion or new folks trying them: https://mastodon.social/@SteveDuncan/113217240463741345 (WordPress in particular)
** "Just to make it more fun, I decided to pursue the AWS instructions on the Indieweb site. They are out of date. After googling a bit, turns out Amazon has yet another product called Lightsail that allows for a pretty rapid start up of an instance with #wordpress. $7/mo rather than free tier. first 90 days free.Let's see how many times I have to do this before I get it right! Nothing puts hair on my palms, screams in my home and poop in my toilet like amateur web administration #indieweb" [https://mastodon.social/@SteveDuncan @SteveDuncan] September 28, 2024

* Request: need more "how to" videos that get directly into it, without any "why" for the folks that come here already convinced [[why]].
** +1 for adding those if available; until then, the videos & articles sections could be turned to links to those respective pages -{{Coyote}}

* Proposal: consider moving anything "Previous" or "Historical" to a separate page to shorten and simplify this one
** +1 from [[User:Osteophage.neocities.org|Coyote]]</s>
