'''<dfn>Gowalla</dfn>''' was a [[location]] [[checkin]] [[silo]] that operated from 2007 to 2012. It is functionally similar to [[Foursquare]] but with a unique design aesthetic that won it loyal fans. It was acquired by [[Facebook]]<ref>http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/02/report-facebook-has-acquired-gowalla/</ref> and unceremoniously shut down soon after, despite their cheerful announcement:

: We’re excited to announce that we’ll be making the journey to California to join Facebook.<ref>[http://adactio.com/articles/6630/ Time], ''Adactio''</ref>

== Reboot ==
In 2021, Josh Williams announced that he was bringing back Gowalla in a new form, with new co-founder Patrick Piemonte. They launched a "Street Team" beta program for early adopters. The new Gowalla uses aspects of augmented reality and NFTs.

The podcast [https://gowalla.fireside.fm The Gowalla Story] ran in 2021 for 5 episodes, hosted by Josh Williams and Dan Benjamin: "an exploration of the rise, fall, reinvention, and reimagining of a startup"
