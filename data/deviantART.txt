'''<dfn>[http://www.deviantart.com/ deviantART]</dfn>''' is an art hosting [[silo]] that retains the rights to resell copyright of anything you post to it, without informing you, and has done so in the past.

== Criticism ==
=== Selling Your Work ===
An attendee of [http://vimeo.com/101137894 this talk] shared her personal experience (video, time offset: 13:52), about how:
* as an artist, she has had work stolen, having been on deviantART for a while
* a business started printing her art on shirts
* that had licensed it from deviantART
* apparently was part of deviantART's TOS that they could do so with her art
** Note that many (most?) silos (e.g. [[Medium]]) have similar TOS where they have the rights to sell your work without your permission or notification.

=== Export ===
