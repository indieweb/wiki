'''<dfn>LGTM</dfn>''' is an acronym for the expression <dfn>looks good to me</dfn> which is sometimes used as quick shorthand in #indiewebcamp IRC discussions to indicate a particularly positive affirmative response to something visual, e.g. a blog [[post]], a wiki page (edit), a code snippet, a [[UI]] design, or often some aspect of personal site [[design]].
