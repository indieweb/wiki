IndieWebCamp [[projects]] related to [[wiki-page]] hosting/creation/editing on your own site.

== Existing Projects ==
=== Smallest Federated Wiki ===
{{main|Smallest Federated Wiki}}
Smallest Federated Wiki was conceived/created/developed/launched at IndieWebCamp [[2011]]
=== MediaWiki ===
{{main|MediaWiki}}
MediaWiki runs indiewebcamp.com, microformats.org/wiki, and is used by IndieWebCamp community members like [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] on http://wiki.tommorris.org/
=== ikiwiki ===
{{main|ikiwiki}}
ikiwiki is another independent site wiki, and is used by IndieWebCamp community members like [[User:greptilian.com|Philip Durbin]] on http://wiki.greptilian.com/

== Brainstorming ==
Thoughts on how an IndieWeb wiki could be implemented

=== Static Pages Plus HTTP Headers ===
This is a brainstorm by [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Ã‡elik]], originally discussed in [[IRC]] 2013-091, captured here for potential iteration.<blockquote>[1:21pm] tantek: I'm actually thinking of, how do I just use a static HTML page itself as the storage for a "wiki" page.</blockquote>

* static HTML files as their own storage of their current/latest version
* previous versions stored elsewhere (e.g. the filesystem)
** date-time-stamp filename suffixing convention
** new link rel to link to the previous [http://microformats.org/wiki/version#brainstorming historical version]
** each version linking explicitly (via invisible <code>&lt;link></code> or visible hyperlink) to the previous version, and [http://microformats.org/wiki/version#current current version].
*** this places a content requirement on the otherwise unrestricted HTML files. 
*** alternatively if this information (what is the previous version) is kept in a database cache, it can be sent with the server as an HTTP LINK Header with rel value.
** the combination would satisfy essential qualities 2,3,4 listed above.
* for editability, it might be a neat trick to write software that made any static HTML page on your site automatically "editable" if you happened to be signed in with [[Web Sign-in]] / [[IndieAuth]].
** similar to revisions/versions, a page could link to its editing interface/version/query parameter with a rel link as well, e.g. rel=edit, which has been previously proposed as part of [http://universaleditbutton.org/Suggestions#JavaScript_links_for_AJAX-driven_edits Universal Edit Button: links for AJAX-driven edits] but could be used for server-based editing state as well. E.g. <code>href="?edit=1"</code>. Again this might be best sent as an HTTP Link Header.
** goal: make a page editable without putting any meta/link in the page itself.
*** should be possible to use HTTP LINK rel=edit to an editing script (for browser plugin discovery)
*** perhaps an HTTP LINK rel=script to execute an editing script (for browsers that don't know about rel=edit).

Interface - there are many ways personal wiki software could provide editing / version browsing features, here are a few:

UI for browsing previous versions:
* slider in Etherpad
* what archive.org puts up in the header on archived page results
* That ins/del [http://codepen.io/barnabywalters/pen/nhmuw slider demo] I made may be of interest/use --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 06:40, 2 April 2013 (PDT)

Brainstorm summary:
# static HTML page as its own storage
# *-date-time suffixed versions of said page in the file system (or perhaps in the YYYY/ directories), linking to latest version and previous versions with rel values
# HTTP LINK headers for browser-editing-plugin discovery and javascript-based fallback
# Access UIs via query parameters e.g. ?edit=1, ?history

== Others ==
Other projects that may be of help with designing/creating/building a wiki content system.

* [http://www.mementoweb.org/  MementoWeb]
** -1 memento seems horribly overdesigned, e.g. has way too many rels, none of them actually useful: original, timegate, timemap. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 16:49, 1 April 2013 (PDT)
