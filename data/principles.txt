The IndieWeb Community is largely based on '''<dfn>principles</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>tenets</dfn>) such as [[own your data]], scratch your own itches, build tools for yourself, [[selfdogfood]], document your stuff, open source your stuff, UX design is more important than protocols, visible data for humans first and machines second, platform agnostic platforms, plurality over [[monoculture]], longevity, and remember to have fun!

'''Key principles of building on the indie web''', numbered for reference, not necessarily for any kind of priority.

# ✊ '''[[own-your-data|Own your data]]'''.
# 🔍 Use '''visible data''' for humans first, machines second. See also [[DRY]].
# 💪 Build '''tools for yourself''', not for all of your friends. It's extremely hard to fight [[wikipedia:Metcalfe's law|Metcalfe's law]]: you won't be able to convince all your friends to join the independent web. But if you build something that satisfies your own needs, but is backwards compatible for people who haven't joined in (say, by practicing [[POSSE]]), the time and effort you've spent building your own tools isn't wasted just because others haven't joined in yet.
# 😋 Eat your own '''[[dogfood]]'''. Whatever you build should be for yourself. If you aren't depending on it, why should anybody else? We call that [[selfdogfood]]ing. More importantly, build the indieweb around your needs. If you design tools for some hypothetical user, they may not actually exist; if you build tools for yourself, you actually do exist. [[selfdogfooding]] is also a form of "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system proof of work]" to help focus on productive interactions.
# 📓 '''Document''' your stuff. You've built a place to speak your mind, use it to document your processes, ideas, designs and code. At least document it for your future self.
# 💞 '''Open source''' your stuff! You don't have to, of course, but if you like the existence of the indie web, making your code open source means other people can get on the indie web quicker and easier.
# 📐 '''[[UX]] and [[design]] is more important''' than protocols, formats, data models, schema etc. We focus on UX first, and then as we figure that out we build/develop/subset the absolutely simplest, easiest, and most minimal protocols & formats sufficient to support that UX, and nothing more. AKA UX before plumbing.
# 🌐 Build '''platform agnostic platforms'''. The more your code is modular and composed of pieces you can swap out, the less dependent you are on a particular device, UI, templating language, API, backend language, storage model, database, platform. The more your code is modular, the greater the chance that at least ''some'' of it can and will be re-used, improved, which you can then reincorporate.
# 🗿 '''[[Longevity]]'''. Build for the '''[http://adactio.com/articles/1522/ long web]'''. If human society is able to preserve ancient papyrus, Victorian photographs and dinosaur bones, we should be able to build web technology that doesn't require us to destroy everything we've done every few years in the name of progress. 
# ✨ <span id="Plurality">'''[[plurality|Plurality]]'''</span>. With IndieWebCamp we've specifically chosen to encourage and embrace a diversity of approaches &amp; implementations.  This <span id="Background">background</span> makes the IndieWeb stronger and more resilient than any one (often [[monoculture]]) approach.
# 🎉 Have '''[[fun]]'''. Remember that GeoCities page you built back in the mid-90s? The one with the Java applets, garish green background and seventeen animated GIFs? It may have been ugly, badly coded and sucky, but it was ''fun, damnit''. Keep the web weird and interesting.

__TOC__
* There seems to be an unwritten principle of focusing on UX that I've encountered multiple times while participating in the indieweb community. A recent example where it was cited is [http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/07/05/1/ this]. Should we make it explicit? (see also [https://twitter.com/blaine/status/353174289194819585]) -[[User:Www.sandeep.io|Www.sandeep.io]] 18:54, 7 July 2013 (PDT)
** Added explicit principle above about UX/design. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 13:40, 24 August 2013 (PDT)
