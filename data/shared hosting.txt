'''<dfn>shared hosting</dfn>''' is a particular level of [[webhosting]] service that includes FTP access with at least [[PHP]] and/or [[Perl]] CGI on a server where a bunch of people have accounts that share the same filesystem, and the same [[Apache]]/[[nginx]] process(es).

See [[webhosting#Shared_Hosting]] for examples and more details.

=== How to know if on shared hosting ===
Q: How can you tell if your webhosting service is a shared hosting service?

A: If you can <kbd>ssh</kbd> into the server, try <kbd>ls /home/</kbd>. If you see an error message like: <blockquote>ls: cannot open directory /home/: Permission denied</blockquote> then you're likely on shared hosting service.
