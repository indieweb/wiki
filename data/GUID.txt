{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>GUID</dfn>''' or <dfn>Globally Unique Identifier</dfn> is a (typically) 128-bit number to uniquely reference or identify something; on the IndieWeb, GUIDs are encouraged in some [[feed file]] formats as supposedly more persistent than [[permalinks]] but in practice GUIDs have been less portable and harder to preserve/migrate/restore than [[permalinks]].

== Criticism ==
=== Less portable than permalinks ===
* Per http://waxy.org/2016/11/redesigning-waxy-2016-edition/ 
<blockquote><p>So I redesigned my blog.</p>[...]<p> After 14 years of blogging, I switched from [[MovableType]] to [[WordPress]]. [...] It took some effort, but '''I preserved the links to everything''' I’ve ever written—472 posts and 15,891 links. </p>[...]<p>The RSS feeds should redirect appropriately, though inevitably marking everything as new because '''I couldn’t migrate GUIDs.'''</p></blockquote> '''emphasis added'''
