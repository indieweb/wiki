{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>geofence</dfn>''' is a virtual geographic boundary that either triggers or limits actions, information, or granularity thereof when crossing it, like {{aaronpk}}’s pulsing blue dot feature.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}}’s site creates a dynamic geofence around his latest [[checkin]], to show a pulsing blue dot if he is still at or nearby, and removes the blue dot from the checkin post when he leaves the geofence, [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/05/19/18/still-here since 2017-05-19].
