[[Community]] development discussion and brainstorming.

== Community development framework checklist ==
[https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/499519295698001920 @emmajanehw on twitter suggested] a helpful resource: [https://www.gov.uk/community-development-framework gov.uk Community development framework]. 

We should make sure that we meet every item on the checklist at the bottom, or have explicit reasons not to, and that it is easy to find for a wiki visitor (from the front page and individual events pages).

'''Skepticism''':
* How is gov.uk (the author of said framework) an authority on community? 
* Does gov.uk have a healthy community themselves?
* Does gov.uk clearly follow their own framework/checklist? (apparent lack of [[selfdogfood]])
Barring obvious answers to these, we should take all their suggestions as "hypothetical nice ideas" - not as any sort of authoritative statement of items known to work.

{{clear}}

===Is there a clear, circulated community vision or objective?===

* First line on the front page: The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. 
** defined in opposition to something?
** has been quoted word-for-word in the media, is thus a powerful statement that resonated sufficiently for the press to reproduce it as-is without editing.
* [[User:KevinMarks.com]] on Twitter: "@indiewebcamp has a clear goal - help you have your own website and learn from others already doing so" [https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/499241528674381824]
** @emmajanehw: @kevinmarks “goal” and “help” are not used in that context on home page or event summary page. [https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/499241961308835840]

===Is there a clearly defined remit - can people easily understand the criteria for membership?===

* ''remit'': "an area of responsibility and authority" [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/remit]
* Bullet points below "Beyond Blogging and Decentralization"
** Principles over project-centrism
** Selfdogfood
*** not obvious to newcomers what that is
** Design first, formats second
* [[Principles]]
* This might not be obvious on individual events pages -- who is this event for?
** @emmajanehw: Currently the top level page talks about the “what” but not the “who”. [https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/499218683945037824]
** @emmajanehw: The categories are foreign to me. I don’t really understand what a Creator vs. a Blogger vs. an Apprentice is. [https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/499218683945037824]
** @emmajanehw: So I looked for something which looked like “me”, or described “me”, but I just found it to be about a diff community. [https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/499219226499219457]

===Is there a way for community members to identify each other and find contact details?===

* [[discuss]] (linked from sidebar and body text of front page)
* [[chat-names]] (linked from discuss)

===Is there at least 1 person responsible for managing information and encouraging constructive participation?===

* not stated anywhere on the wiki (?) but fairly apparent on IRC
** not true but apparently we can make it more visible
* '''[[code-of-conduct]]''' linked from home page and every event home page.
** +1 great point, coc fits this perfectly. It was not linked on [[2014/UK]] or [[2014/Cambridge]], but I will add it!

===Is there a way for members to interact in an informal way?===

* IRC backchannel
** not publicized
*** not true, on the home page side bar "Discuss" and prominent on the home page, Getting Started, and individual event pages.
**** I was talking about [[indiechat]] specifically [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]

===Is there a way or place for people to share or archive potentially useful resources, knowledge and documents?===

* [http://indiewebcamp.com indiewebcamp.com]

===Are there regular opportunities for community members to meet in person?===

* [[Events]]
* Bi-weekly [[Homebrew Website Club]]
* frequent [[IndieWebCamps|IndieWebCamp events]]

===Is there a published and community-owned programme of activities, both on- and offline?===

* Redundant with previous item?
** Yes, this checklist and previous could be collapsed. Poor editing of checklist itself.
* [[Events]]

===Are there opportunities for members to influence the activities and resources of the community?===

* [[discuss]]
* [[wiki]]

===Are there clearly defined metrics and plans to measure and regularly report on community activity?===
* [[irc/today|Chat logs]] on site sidebar
* [[this-week-in-the-indieweb]] is an automated report on wiki activity
* "What's everyone working on" a regular feature of [[Homebrew Website Club]]
* Notes on every [[Homebrew Website Club]] page, including link to IRC logs during the meetups where meetup activity is recorded.
