'''<dfn>[https://granary.io/ granary]</dfn>''' is the social web translator. It's a library, REST API, and webapp that frees you from social network [[snowflake]] API and exposes the sweet social data foodstuff inside as HTML and JSON with [[microformats2]], [[ActivityStreams]], [[JSON Feed]], Atom, RSS, XML, and more.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{gregor}} uses Granary to synthesize Atom feeds from the [[h-feed]]+[[h-entry]] on various pages, thus avoiding the need to maintain a separate [[feed file]] or code to generate it. Examples:
** https://gregorlove.com/stream/feed.atom for https://gregorlove.com/stream/
** https://gregorlove.com/channels/photos/feed.atom for https://gregorlove.com/channels/photos/
** https://gregorlove.com/notes.atom for https://gregorlove.com/notes (older version, will probably redirect to the stream one above at some point)
