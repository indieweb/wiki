'''<dfn>[https://granary.io/ granary]</dfn>''' is an open source social web translator that converts between various feed and activity formats, used by IndieWeb community members to for example automatically generate feed files from HTML.

It's a library, REST API, and webapp that frees you from social network [[snowflake]] API and exposes the sweet social data foodstuff inside as HTML and JSON with [[microformats2]], [[ActivityStreams]], [[JSON Feed]], Atom, RSS, XML, and more.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{gregor}} uses Granary to synthesize Atom feeds from the [[h-feed]]+[[h-entry]] on various pages, thus avoiding the need to maintain a separate [[feed file]] or code to generate it. Examples:
** https://gregorlove.com/stream/feed.atom for https://gregorlove.com/stream/
** https://gregorlove.com/channels/photos/feed.atom for https://gregorlove.com/channels/photos/
** https://gregorlove.com/notes.atom for https://gregorlove.com/notes (older version, will probably redirect to the stream one above at some point)

* {{sarajaksa}} uses Granary to change her gallery and read books lists into RSS feeds.
** https://sarajaksa.eu/books/ becomes https://sarajaksa.eu/rss-books.xml
** https://sarajaksa.eu/gallery/ becomes https://sarajaksa.eu/rss-gallery.xml

* [[User:calebh.top]] uses Granary to generate an Atom feed from his blog's homepage.
** https://calebh.top/feed/ for https://calebh.top/posts/
