'''<dfn>guest pass</dfn>''' is a feature of at least one silo ([[Flickr]]) that allows a user to create a special URL to an otherwise private or protected [[post]] or [[collection]], such that the user can send that URL to someone (like over email or [[chat]]) allowing them to browse the protected content without signing in or otherwise creating a [[silo]] account.
