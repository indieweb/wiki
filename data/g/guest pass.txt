'''<dfn>guest pass</dfn>''' is a feature of at least one silo ([[Flickr]]) that allows a user to create a special URL to an otherwise private or protected [[post]] or [[collection]], that includes a code to access that thing, such that the user can send that URL to others without a silo account, like over email or [[chat]], allowing them to view that thing without signing in or otherwise creating a [[silo]] account.
