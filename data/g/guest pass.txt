{{stub}}

'''<dfn>guest pass</dfn>''' is a feature of at least one silo ([[Flickr]]) that allows a user to create a special URL to an otherwise private/protected [[post]] or [[collection]], that the user can send that URL to others (like over email or [[chat]]), where viewing it would set a [[cookie]] and redirect them to the actual protected content URL, allowing them to browse it without signing in or otherwise creating a [[silo]] account, and (used to) display a prominent banner that they were viewing that content via a Guest Pass.

== vs capability URL ==
A guest pass is different from a [[capability URL]], in that the guest pass encodes some form of elevated access-state which persists in the viewer's browser (typically via cookies), so they can return via an otherwise normal permalink URL. That elevated access-state is typically displayed to the viewer in the form of a banner usually above the content, clearly communicating that the viewer is seeing something that is not otherwise publicly accessible.
