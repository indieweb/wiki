    '''<dfn>geocaching</dfn>''' is hiding and locating containers at specific geographic coordinates using GPS.

The dominant silo providing services to the geocaching community is [[Geocaching.com]]. Other sites include terracaching.com and opencache.uk. Geocache logs could be considered [[checkin]]s.

== Brainstorming ==

Besides the checkin information, I would also suggest another property which indicates whether you have found or did not find the log. Something like p-geocache-log-type where value is either 'found' or 'not-found'. With this property, we can also explicitly set a post to 'geocache' instead of a checkin only.

== PESOS to WordPress ==

{{template:danq}} has implemented a [[WordPress]] plugin that performs manually-initiated [[PESOS]] from a variety of geocaching websites including [[Geocaching.com]] and opencache.uk and is [[selfdogfood]]ing it on [https://danq.me/ danq.me]: '''[https://danq.me/2018/09/16/importing-geocaching-logs-into-wordpress/ blog post] | [https://github.com/Dan-Q/danq-geocaching-reposter source code]'''
