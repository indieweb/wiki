{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>grumpinition</dfn>''' is a portmanteau of grumpy and definition meaning a definition written in such a way that the author was clearly upset with the term or phrase being defined, often for specific reasons, which may be explicitly noted in the definition.

It's recommended to avoid this for the same reasons as [[snarkinition#Criticisms|snarkinition criticism]]. Instead, capture criticisms in a separate criticism section of the page.
