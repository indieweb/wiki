'''<dfn>Geocoding</dfn>''' is the process of turning a text form location (such as an address or name of a place) into a set of geographical coordinates. The inverse, reverse geocoding, turns a set of geographical coordinates into an address or a place name. Either method, or both, might be used for location aware applications, or during the process of computing locations for [[checkin|checkins]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} geotags all his posts to display the city name of where the post was created. The geocoding is done via [[Atlas]]

== Geocoding Services ==
* [[Nominatim]] uses [[OpenStreetMap]] data
* [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start Google Maps Geocoding API]
* [https://www.mapbox.com/geocoding/ Mapbox]
* [http://geocoding.geo.census.gov/ Geocoder] (U.S. Census Bureau)
* [https://developers.arcgis.com/ Esri's mapping services]
* http://www.geonames.org/ - not strictly a geocoding service, but has free databases/webservices for countries, postal codes, placenames, and their coordinates.
