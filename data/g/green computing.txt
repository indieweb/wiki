**I have a group of projects in the pipeline that will create large amounts of data, that need to be processed and the pay-as-you-go for cloud computing resources sound very attractive. - [[user:tomasparks.name | tomasparks]]

=== cloud computing ===
[[cloud|Cloud computing]] companies claim because they can optimize server utilization compared to on-premises computing, that they use less power. But critics like Greenpeace claim that they are still using dirty power [http://www.clickclean.org/]

=== static sites ===
Are [[static_site]]s the best option?

* External resources like [[JavaScript]], [[Cascading_Style_Sheets]] or [[fonts]]/[[icon_font]], there are two options include with your website (more data to download) or use cloud hosted version (less data to download because it been cached in the web browser, but is reliant on third party host)
* External interactive contents ([[webmention.io]], [[Bridgy]] and [[Disqus]]) reliant on third party host.
* A [[static_site_generator]] toolchain could defeat the whole reason for going static.
