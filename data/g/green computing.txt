** "Therefore the whole site and server services has been thought over and the average page size has been reduced to 450,56kb (Low tech, High future)."

=== Purchase when you need to ===

Only purchase a new computing device when you need to. Purchasing a new computer every year will let you stay up to date on the latest specifications but it will also produce a carbon footprint.

It's better to keep a device until that device is no longer usable.

**I'm in a catch-22, I could build the low-tech website server, but my isp needs me to have a business plan to host anything on my connection and I would still need a CDN.
**I have a group of projects in the pipeline that will create large amounts of data, that need to be processed <s>and the pay-as-you-go for cloud computing resources sound very attractive.</s> Cloud computing is looking less and less value for money and running my own [[home_server|homelab]] is looking more attractive. - [[user:tomasparks.name | tomasparks]]

* {{jamesgoca}}
** Website was designed to use as few resources as possible. I compress images before they are uploaded and I use images sparingly on the site. I have spent extensive time removing redundant styles on the style sheet. At one point, my site had no favicon to reduce the number of requests that had to be made for my site to load.

== Brainstorming ==
# While looking for a new [[web_hosting|website host]] check their Sustainability policy.
# Using a [[static_site_generator]] as most web hosts have better deals because they don't need to charge for [[database-antipattern|databases]].
# Setup a tool like [[fail2ban]] to monitor access logs, detect signs of wasteful traffic, and act by blocking the source IP on the firewall. Traffic from that source no longer reaches the web-server, avoiding the need to send so much as a 404 page. Traffic considered wasteful including but not limited to [https://gist.github.com/dale3h/660fe549df8232d1902f338e6d3b39ed bots of ill repute], malicious log-in attempts, and scripts scanning for backups and similar left in the public web root in error. 
#* Bonus: Apply the firewall rule at a lower level of the network stack, e.g. on the infrastructure provider's edge firewall, using an API.
# Use a [[static_site]] so that each page does not need to be dynamically rendered
# Use algorithms like dithering (see Low Tech Magazine) to reduce the size of images
# Remove or reduce the amount of JavaScript on a page

=== Performance and green computing ===

There is a significant correlation between the performance of a website and green computing.

Many green computing efforts aim to reduce the impact of a website on the environment. This inevitably involves making a website do more with less.

This could mean using fewer images on a site, rendering web safe fonts instead of assets from a font repository like Google Fonts, or taking other steps to make your site smaller.

These changes would all make a site load faster. Both green computing and performance can be considered in the same context but a separation of concerns may be useful.

Performance enhancements refer to all of the changes made to optimize a site. Green computing measures are those taken specifically to reduce environmental impact. This distinction becomes more necessary if you want to justify the reasoning behind a change on your site. (i.e. you may change a blog post structure because it is too cluttered, or because you want to save on bytes)

=== cloud computing ===
[[cloud|Cloud computing]] companies claim because they can optimize server utilization compared to on-premises computing, that they use less power. But critics like Greenpeace claim that they are still using dirty power [http://www.clickclean.org/]

=== static sites ===
Are [[static_site]]s the best option?

* External resources like [[JavaScript]], [[Cascading_Style_Sheets]] or [[fonts]]/[[icon_font]], there are two options include with your website (more data to download) or use cloud hosted version (less data to download because it been cached in the web browser, but is reliant on third party host)
* External interactive contents ([[webmention.io]], [[Bridgy]] and [[Disqus]]) reliant on third party host.
* A [[static_site_generator]] toolchain could defeat the whole reason for going static.
examples: 
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment Continuous website deployment] without caching and/or differencing.
* Multiple [[static_site_generator]] build cycles in the toolchain.
