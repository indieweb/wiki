<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Green Computing</dfn>''' is practice of using computers and their resources in environmentally responsible way.
A few ways that this can be done, by using green power (Renewable energy) and electronic recycling.</span>


== Brainstorming ==


1. While looking for a new [[web_hosting|website host]] check their Sustainability policy.
2. using a [[static_site_generator]].

* [[selfdogfood| DIY]] solar/battery powered SBC [https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html How to Build a Low-tech Website?]. 


=== cloud computing ===

[[cloud|Cloud computing]] company's claim because they can optimize server utilization compared to on-premises computing, that they use less power. But critics like Greenpeace claim that they are still using dirty power [http://www.clickclean.org/]

=== static sites ===

* [[static_site]] are the best option, but the [[static_site_generator]] toolchain could defeat the whole reason for going static.
examples: 
* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment|Continuous website deployment]] without caching and/or differencing.
* Multiple [[static_site_generator]] build cycles in the toolchain.
* [[User:vincentp.me]]'s [[https://github.com/vipickering/mastr-cntrl| mastr-cntrl]]



* External resources like [[JavaScript]], [[Cascading_Style_Sheets]] or [[fonts]]/[[icon_font]], there are two options include with your website (more data to download) or use cloud hosted version (less data to download because it been cached in the web browser, but is reliant on third party host)
* External interactive contents ([[webmention.io]], [[Bridgy]] and [[Disqus]]) reliant on third party host.

=== Tom sparks ===
I'm in a catch-22, I could build the low-tech website server, but my isp needs me to have a business plan to host anything on my connection and I would still need a CDN.
I have a group of projects in the pipeline that will create large amounts of data, that need to be processed and the pay-as-you-go for cloud computing resources sound very attractive. - [[user:tomasparks.name | tomasparks]]
