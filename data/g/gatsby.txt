'''<dfn>[https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby Gatsby]</dfn>''' is a [[React]]-based [[static site generator]] with live preview.

Gatsby uses React to render static pages that follow the [https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/ PRPL] pattern for exceptional loading speed.  The static pages can be sourced from a huge variety of data, translated into GraphQL, then queried to produce a collection of pages that are generated at build time.

This means that there is HTML markup that's fully machine-readable - making it SEO/indie/webmention/[[js;dr]] friendly.

At the moment it supports many data sources:
* Filesystem (often Markdown files)
* [[Drupal]]
* [[Medium.com]]
* [[WordPress]]
* [[MongoDB]]
* [[RSS]]

These data sources can then be transformed:
* Remark (turn Markdown into HTML)
* [[YAML]]
* [[TOML]]

''(Note that these are only read during build time - so you must re-build to get new content out)''

=== Incremental Builds ===
Gatsby officially began supporting incremental builds in April 2020: {{citation

|author = [https://www.gatsbyjs.com Gatsby]
|published = 2020-04-22
}}

These are primarily designed to be used in conjunction with their own paid hosting platform, [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/ Gatsby Cloud], but a [[Netlify]] plugin provides at least partial support:

=== JS;DR ===
Out of the box, Gatsby uses the [[React]] "hydration" model. That means whilst a Gatsby site is statically rendered during the build process, pages are still sent to the browser with a large JavaScript bundle that effectively loads React on top of the existing website. Whilst this provides some clever features – like Gatsby's page pre-caching, image optimisations, and client-side routing – it can also be a performance concern.

The Gatsby community has come up with two possible solutions to this issue:
* The [https://github.com/itmayziii/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript No JavaScript] plugin which removes all client-side React bundles during the build process;
* The [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact Preact] plugin which replaces React with Preact, providing many of the same client-side benefits but with a reduced JavaScript bundle size.

Gatsby has also come under criticism for shipping with a default [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noscript noscript] message recommending JavaScript, even though many Gatsby sites don't actually need JavaScript enabled to run.

== Opportunities ==
When it comes to "incoming" data to this site generator, it would have to push the data to one of the connected data sources then trigger a rebuild. Even without access to incremental builds the performance is pretty good for small-ish sites to do a complete rebuild.

You could probably handle incoming [[webmentions]] by having a small app on another subdomain that pushes the webmentions into MongoDB, then triggers a rebuild of the site to include new mentions.

== Plugins ==
=== Webmentions ===
* Christopher Biscardi has developed a Webmention plugin available on [https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-plugin-webmention Github].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members using Gatsby on their own primary sites:
* [https://theadhocracy.co.uk Murray] - {{murray}} uses Gatsby on his personal site, including displaying [[webmentions]] and providing [[microformats]] feeds.
* {{addyourself}}

Other independents that are using it on their <em>primary</em> self-identifying site:
* [https://www.joshwcomeau.com Josh W Comeau] — Josh previously worked for Gatsby and continues to use the platform for his personal site.

** "Have been trying out @gatsbyjs. It's very nice component based stuff. I like it! But it assumes that your next step is building an SPA, so it tries to load a metric crapton of JS that I simply don't need or want on my page. Pages are 150x bigger than they should be. 😭" [https://www.sonniesedge.net @sonniesedge] May 3, 2019
