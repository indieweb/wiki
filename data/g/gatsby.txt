'''<dfn>[https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby Gatsby]</dfn>''' is a [[React]]-based [[static site generator]] with live preview.

Gatsby uses React to render static pages that follow the [https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/ PRPL] pattern for exceptional loading speed.  The static pages can be sourced from a huge variety of data, translated into GraphQL, then queried to produce a collection of pages that around generated at build time.

This means that there is HTML markup that's fully machine readable - making it SEO/indie/webmention/js;dr friendly.

At the moment it supports many data sources:
* Filesystem (often Markdown files)
* [[Drupal]]
* [[Medium.com]]
* [[WordPress]]
* [[MongoDB]]
* [[RSS]]

These data sources can then be transformed:
* Remark (turn Markdown into HTML)
* [[YAML]]
* [[TOML]]

''(Note that these are only read during build time - so you must re-build to get new content out)''

== Opportunities ==
When it comes to "incoming" data to this site generator, it would have to push the data to one of the connected data sources then trigger a rebuild.  At the moment it doesn't support incremental rebuilds but overall the performance is pretty good for small-ish sites to do a complete rebuild.

You could probably handle incoming webmentions by having a small app on another subdomain that pushes the webmentions into MongoDB, then triggers a rebuild of the site to include new mentions.

** "Have been trying out @gatsbyjs. It's very nice component based stuff. I like it! But it assumes that your next step is building an SPA, so it tries to load a metric crapton of JS that I simply don't need or want on my page. Pages are 150x bigger than they should be. ðŸ˜­" [https://www.sonniesedge.net @sonniesedge] May 3, 2019
