A '''<dfn>gallery</dfn>''' is a deliberately curated set of [[photo]]s, that may itself be a [[post]], or an [[archive]] view, or potentially dynamically created via [[tags]].

== Layout ==
Gallery layouts are usually organized in some sort of grid fashion.

== Platform Examples ==
[[Projects]] and other software platforms that have a notion / feature support of "gallery".

=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] software offers two image related post formats.

* image - A single image. The first <img /> tag in the post could be considered the image. Alternatively, if the post consists only of a URL, that will be the image URL and the title of the post (post_title) will be the title attribute for the image.
* gallery - A gallery of images. Post will likely contain a gallery shortcode and will have image attachments.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] confusingly has several different kinds of galleries each with their own quirky limitations:
* '''Set''' (also called '''Album''' in the UI) - a curation of your own photos
* '''Gallery''' - a curation of other people's photos
** They have a "special" Galllery called '''Favorites''' now (with 2014 UI update), whereas Favorites used to be a completely separate thing.
* '''Photo Book''' - ??? something new

== Software Examples ==
=== MediaWiki ===
'''<code>&lt;gallery&gt;</code>''' is also a special [[MediaWiki]] element (open and close tags) for embedding multiple columns (multicolumn) of images. E.g. used on this wiki:
* [[streak#Duolingo]]

Code sample:
<pre><gallery heights="480px" widths="240px">

</gallery></pre>
