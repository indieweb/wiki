Google announced that starting 2018-04-13, no new short links could be created, but existing links would continue to redirect.

* 2025-08-01 The Verge: [https://www.theverge.com/news/717649/google-goo-gl-url-shortener-links-backtrack Google backtracks on plans to deactivate shortened goo.gl links] / If a goo.gl link doesn’t already have a deactivation message, then it will keep functioning as normal. <blockquote>Goo.gl URLS that already show a message saying that they will be deactivated in August will still stop working — the company started showing the deactivation message nine months ago on URLs that “showed no activity in late 2024” — but otherwise, “all other goo.gl links will be preserved and will continue to function as normal,”</blockquote>
