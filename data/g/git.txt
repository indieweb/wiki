'''<dfn>Git</dfn>''' is a popular distributed source control management system that can be used to host and share [[code]] from independent sites.

== Why ==
Why use git on your own site? Good question â€” to be answered by those that do!

Especially, why use git rather than some other indie [[code]] solution.

== How to ==
=== Documentation ===
There is plenty of good documentation about Git. Here's a few links to get started:
* [http://git-scm.com/docs Official Git reference manual] which is a collection of the Git man pages formatted in HTML.
* [http://git-scm.com/book Pro Git] is an open source book available for free online or for sale from [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430218339 Amazon] for a hard copy.
* [https://git.wiki.kernel.org Git Wiki] hosted by https://kernel.org.
* [http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html Git Cheatsheet]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
(stub - needs per person headings and "since YYYY-MM-DD" dates for each!)

* {{cweiske}} uses [http://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb.html gitweb] for http://git.cweiske.de/ and mirrors them to github
** http://git.cweiske.de/grauphel.git/ (original) and https://github.com/cweiske/grauphel/ (mirror)
* {{rascul}} uses [http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit cgit] and [http://gitolite.com/gitolite gitolite] for http://git.rascul.xyz.
*[[User:Unrelenting.technology|myfreeweb]] uses [https://github.com/jonashaag/klaus klaus] for https://unrelenting.technology/git/
* {{aaronpk}} uses [[Gogs]] for mostly private repositories at https://code.pin13.net [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/02/13/18/ read more]
* {{ds}} self-hosts some of his [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/... Go packages] on his personal website. When performing actions such as pushing commits, creating/deleting branches, etc., corresponding events shows up on his activity timeline (it happens for both self- and GitHub-hosted repositories). See [[Media:push_event_for_self-hosted_git_repo.png|screenshot]].

Broken:
*[[User:brandonrozek.com|brandonrozek]] uses [https://github.com/klaussilveira/gitlist gitlist] for https://repos.brandonrozek.com

== Software ==
The following software can be installed to provide git services on your own site:
* [https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb Gitweb] is distributed with git.
* [http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit cgit] is a fast CGI web interface written in C.
* [http://gitolite.com/gitolite gitolite] may be used for repository hosting and access control on your own domain.
* [[Gogs]] and its fork [[Gitea]], a self-hosted Git service written in Go.
* [http://projects.ceondo.com/p/indefero/ Indefero] is a clone of https://code.google.com.
* [http://redmine.org Redmine] is a project management application.
* Depending on your goals, git may be able to handle what you want without any additional interfaces or tools. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/10888536 for some information on that.
* Much more listed at https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Interfaces,_frontends,_and_tools.

== Silos Running Open Source Software ==
You can use their silo or host it yourself with their open source software:
* [[GitLab]] is a complete git hosting solution which provides an interface similar to [[GitHub]].
* http://repo.or.cz provides git repository hosting using [http://repo.or.cz/w/girocco.git girocco].

== Silos ==
* [[Bitbucket]]
* [[GitHub]]
* [[Google Code]]

== POSSE ==
Here are some methods one might use to publish on their own site (host the repo on your site) and syndicate elsewhere (push to [[GitHub]]):

* Simplest method is to add the silo (GitHub) as a separate repo and push to it when you're ready:
<code><pre>git remote add github git@github.com:user/repo
git push github</pre></code>

* Using [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks git hooks] one could [[POSSE]] to any of the git silos.

== Criticism ==
=== Complex Unmemorable Commands ===
Git, like many command line tools, has so many complex unmemorable commands that interact with each other in strange ways that it's far too easy to get something wrong, and far too hard to remember what the right thing is. They might as well be magic incantations (perhaps that has some appeal, like making it an "insider" jargon thing?).

This satirical parody illustrates the git commands problem quite well:
* http://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/ (note: [[js;dr]] link, requires [[JS]])
