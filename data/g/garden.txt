'''<dfn>garden</dfn>''' is a place for deliberate plant growing, decorative or edible or fruit bearing, a topic of some indieweb posts, and brainstorming for structured posts about planting, plant growth, flowering, bearing fruit, or sometimes a metaphor for a personal website with a topic pages rather than posts focus ([[digital garden]]), or a caretaking metaphor for wikis ([[wiki gardening]]).

=== Anthony Ciccarello ===
{{aciccarello}} [https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues/1 Considering adding to site] (or making a subdomain). Previously, he used [https://www.gardentags.com/profile/a3chic9 GardenTags] to post and track his plants.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Information to include ===
* Common & scientific names
* Growth/Change/Death
* Origin (seed, store, cutting)
* Harvesting, pruning, splitting/propagating
* Preferred conditions (light, water, soil)
* Photos

=== Grouping related posts ===
* Part of the fun of gardening is seeing individual plants/plots grow over time so posts should be linked somehow
* Plant care often happens in bursts, once a week of watering, maybe every few months for re-potting and other projects. Lots of updates on individual plants might be better posted as a [[collection]] in a [[feed]] or kept entirely separate from a main feed.

=== Why ===
Brainstorming why: categories worth growing yourself: 
# organic (you have much more control, costs you less to control than certified organic farms, avoid woowoo practices)
# narrow ideal ripening window
# easily bruised/harmed in transport. Examples: tomatoes, avocados

=== Not why ===
Not a why not, but not a reason why, cleaning indoor air:
