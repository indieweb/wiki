'''<dfn>garden</dfn>''' is a place for deliberate growing of plants, decorative or for eating, that are sometimes the primary subject of IndieWeb posts, and is an area of exploration for more structured posts around planting, plant growth, flowering, bearing fruit etc.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* https://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/?tagged=garden
* {{aciccarello}} [[https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues/1 Considering adding to site]] (or making a subdomain)

== Brainstorming ==
=== Information to include ===
* Common & scientific names
* Growth/Change
* Origin (seed, store, cutting)
* Harvesting, pruning, splitting/propagating
* Preferred conditions (light, water, soil)
* Photos

=== Grouping related posts ===
* Part of the fun of gardening is seeing individual plants/plots grow over time so posts should be linked somehow
