'''<dfn>guestbook</dfn>''' is a way to allow visitors to your site to leave a [[comment]] about the website as a whole, instead of a comment about a specific post.

In the context of IndieWebCamps, starting with [[2018/Baltimore|IndieWebCamp Baltimore 2018]], the term has been used for the page that attendees can optionally share the [[projects]] they're working on. See: [[2018/Baltimore/Guest_Book]]

== Why ==

'''Community:''' A guestbook lets you hear from the people who visit your site. Visitors can leave a comment about anything, whether it's the structure of your site, its ease of use, or something interesting they have discovered. The feedback visitors leave could be valuable in helping a webmaster improve their website.

'''Nostalgia:''' Guestbooks were a common feature on personal websites in the late 90s and early 2000s. Adding a guestbook to your site is an ode to the web of the past.

== How ==

A guestbook can be set up using [[Webmention]]s. A website should have a devoted page for guestbook entries to which users can send a webmention.

A website may, optionally, provide a form through which people can send webmentions.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{capjamesg}} uses [[webmention.io]] to retrieve webmentions submitted to his guestbook.
* {{ana-r}} also uses webmention.io to show guestbook entries.
* {{chrisaldrich}} aggregates comments and Webmentions on a page at https://boffosocko.com/mentions/ which acts a bit like either a Facebook Wall or a guestbook which can be posted to remotely.
