    '''<dfn>guestbook</dfn>''' is a way to allow visitors to your site to leave a [[comment]] about the website as a whole, instead of a comment about a specific post.

In the context of IndieWebCamps, starting with [[2018/Baltimore|IndieWebCamp Baltimore 2018]], the term has been used for the page that attendees can optionally share the [[projects]] they're working on. See: [[2018/Baltimore/Guest_Book]]
