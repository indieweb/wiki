'''<dfn>[https://pages.gitlab.io/ GitLab Pages]</dfn>''' is a static [[content hosting service]] by [[GitLab]].

Important differences to the older and more well-known [[github-pages|GitHub Pages]]:

* Sites are build using GitLab's CI service and therefore can use any [[static site generator]], vs only Jekyll on GitHub Pages. GitLab provides [https://gitlab.com/groups/pages example repositories for many generators].

* GitLab Pages allows using custom domains with HTTPS
