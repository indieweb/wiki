A '''<dfn>game play</dfn>''' is a [[passive]] type of [[post]] used to publish a game (digital or otherwise) that you have played.


== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Acegiak ===
[[user:acegiak.net|acegiak]] publishes her game plays using Videogamegeek.com and Boardgamegeek.com as databases for url links for digital and non-digital games respectively. Plays are published as Game Plays under the [[Post_Kinds_Plugin]] taxonomy.

When playing games on the PC this process is automated with a python script on a cron job:

Plays of other games such as boardgames and mobile games are published manually.
