A '''<dfn>game play</dfn>''' or simply '''<dfn>play</dfn>''' is a [[passive]] type of [[post]] used to publish a game (digital or otherwise) that you have played.


== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Acegiak ===
[[user:acegiak.net|acegiak]] publishes her game plays using Videogamegeek.com and Boardgamegeek.com as databases for url links for digital and non-digital games respectively. Plays are published as Game Plays under the [[Post_Kinds_Plugin]] taxonomy.

When playing games on the PC this process is automated with a python script on a cron job:

Plays of other games such as boardgames and mobile games are published manually.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has posted "plays" to his site since [http://boffosocko.com/2018/01/04/sorry/ 2018-01-04] and maintains a separate feed of them at http://boffosocko.com/kind/play/. Generally he expects to post them in a simple [[note|notelike]] manner with the name of the game potentially with a link and an optional photo. He does this using the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] for [[WordPress]].

=== Jonathan LaCour ===
{{cleverdevil}} has posted "plays" to his site since [https://cleverdevil.io/2019/super-mario-party-2 2019-03-24]. He created [https://github.com/cleverdevil/Known-Play a plugin] for [[Known]] that creates the posts, and then created a few scripts (inspired by [https://eddiehinkle.com/2019/03/13/5/code/ code] from {{eddiehinkle}}) to poll Nintendo's online tracking (via its Parental Controls app) and then to automatically create "play" entries. The entries show up in his [http://cleverdevil.io/summary/2019/03 monthly summaries] and his [http://cleverdevil.io/overview overview page].

Related to want posts, but not quite posts themselves, a few folks keep lists of things they [[want]] to [[acquisition|acquire]] or consume.
