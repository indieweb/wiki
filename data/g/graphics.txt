== Building Block Logos ==
{{main|Building block icons}}

== Images and Photos ==

== Slide Decks ==

== Suggested Improvements ==
* Remove G+ (defunct)
* Add Swarm (note [[OwnYourSwarm]]) as another PESOS + backfeed option
* Start at the top left, instead of lower left. or perhaps top middle if it's going to be a clockwise cycle, like noon.
* More detail or separate [[Microsub]] client + server diagram
* Add [[WebSub]] for optional realtime Microsub server/aggregator support
* Should [[Vouch]] go anywhere? Maybe on another diagram?
* Clean-up all the various colors used so they're minimized (per Tufte) and used to clearly convey specific meanings. 
* Maybe a variant diagram? Re-orient/reformat diagram to focus on user features enabled by Webmention+microformats first & foremost, and the other protocols only secondarily. 

== Tools ==
* https://gojs.net/latest/samples/ has many HTML + JS samples for all sorts of diagrams!
