{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>glossary</dfn>''' is a part of a post or site that defines terms used therein, usually as part of a footer, sometimes as a separate page on a site, and occasionally sprinkled into sidebar content.

If you’re looking for a glossary of IndieWeb terms, that’s the IndieWeb wiki itself! If you want to help improve the IndieWeb "glossary" as it were, see:
* '''[[definition]]'''

== Why ==
Using an explicit glossary can avoid the need to hyperlink [[jargon]] or other rare or unobvious terms inline, reducing the chance that such hyperlinks may distract from the flow of reading.

== How to ==
Patterns and best practices for post and site glossaries are still being researched and in development. For now, take a look at IndieWeb Examples and Brainstorming sections for ideas and experiment with your own site.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{kevinmarks}} has included glossary-like definitions of terms in a sidebar near the use of said terms in the flow of the prose, since 2022-07-31:
** [https://www.kevinmarks.com/memex.html The Quest for a Memex 2022-07-31]
* {{t}} has included post glossaries in some [[post footer]]s since 2023-02-05:
** 2023-02-05: [https://tantek.com/2023/036/t1/footnotes-unicode-hyperlink In recent posts I’ve used ASCII footnotes like "^1" to indicate more information about a subject in a footnote…]
** 2023-02-06: [https://tantek.com/2023/037/t1/post-glossary Taking a closer look at both my syntax and use-cases of footnotes in posts¹ revealed that a post glossary would suffice in many instances.]
*** explicitly puts [[footnotes]] section after post glossary

== Brainstorming ==
* Glossaries should be formatted similar to their print equivalents
* Glossaries could use the HTML <code><nowiki><dl> <dt> <dd></nowiki></code> tags & elements

== Posts ==

== Beware ==
=== Deceptive redefinition ===
Beware of (and please avoid) using a glossary to (somewhat?) misleadingly/manipulatively define terms as something other than what they are commonly used for, or overly broad in scope.

Example of use of a glossary for such an "overly broad" redefinition:
* 2006-12-06 {{kevinmarks}} in [http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/12/gowers-biased-rhetoric.html Gowers' biased rhetoric] noted the problem of a press release redefining "piracy" far beyond customary accepted uses, and in a misleading way in an attempt to encroach and de-legitimize actual legitimate (and protected) uses.
