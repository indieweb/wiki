'''<dfn>Specifications</dfn>''' are technical documentation of how to support key [[building blocks]] for the indieweb, in particular, to achieve various levels and axes of [[IndieMark]] feature functionality with [[formats]], [[protocols]], and algorithms for consuming, sending, and receiving.

== IndieWebCamp Specifications ==
The following specifications are developed here in the IndieWebCamp community.

Widely implemented:
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[Webmention]]
* [[Micropub]]

Being implemented / in development:
* [[authorship]]
* [[fragmentions]]
* [[original-post-discovery]]
* [[vouch]]
* h-entry extensions:
** p-rsvp
** u-like-of
** u-repost-of

== microformats specifications ==
Per IndieWebCamp [[principles]], the following microformats specifications are (re-)used heavily as essential simple building block extensions to HTML:
* [[h-card]]
* [[h-cite]]
* [[h-entry]]
* [[h-event]]
* [[h-feed]]
* [[rel-me]]
* [[rel-syndication]] (and u-syndication property)
* [[rel-in-reply-to]] (and u-in-reply-to property)
* ...

== Specs to iterate on ==
Here are specs we should iterate on for more formal publishing / announcing saying they're "done" enough etc. In rough order of simpler / shorter first (all of these should normatively reference [[microformats]] and IndieWeb specs as needed).
* [[post-type-discovery]] - AKA implied post type - see [[posts]] for a start on this.
** +1 {{kartik}} (useful for me for [[comments-presentation]] and other [[responses]])
* [[authorship]]
** +1 {{kartik}} (useful to discover author of a [[response]])
* [[original-post-discovery]]
** +1 {{snarfed}}. (When [[rel-syndication]] links exist, or for a single known user, this is easy. Otherwise, interpreting backlinks is currently difficult and problematic.)
* [[indie-post-discovery]] - see and expand from [[original-post-discovery]], and then incorporate [[PESOS]] scenarios as well
* [[fragmentions]]
** +1 {{kartik}}
* [[post streams]] - simple minimal post-centric HTML-based approach to [[ActivityStreams]]
** reference [[h-entry]] and add properties necessary for IndieWeb use-cases e.g. p-rsvp, u-like-of, u-repost-of, u-tag-of etc.
* [[Webmention]]
** +1 {{kartik}}
** +1 {{snarfed}}
* [[Micropub]]
** +0 {{kartik}} (not using it a lot yet, but surely in the future.)
* [[Vouch]]
* [[IndieAuth]]
** +0 {{kartik}} (not using it a lot yet, but surely in the future.)
* [[syndication-brainstorming#Syndicate_by_Reference|syndicate by reference]]
** +1 {{snarfed}} ([[Bridgy]] has done this for a long time; [[IndieNews]] is migrating to it)
* [[syndication-brainstorming#Syndicate_by_Content|syndicate by content]]
* ...

== Other specifications ==
There are other specifications that even though various IndieWeb implementations / sites may support, they're not necessary for web independence, and thus omitted here.

To keep things especially simpler for authors and publishers, the indieweb does not depend on any specifications which require the author to duplicate (e.g. [[DRY]] violate) their content on additional URLs (e.g. [[sidefile-antipattern]]).
