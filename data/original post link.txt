An '''<dfn>original post link</dfn>''' is a hyperlink from a [[POSSE]] copy to its original indieweb post.

== Why ==
You should post original post links on a POSSE copy of your original post in order to make it:
* more clear that the POSSE copy is a copy
* easier for humans to click through to the original post
* enable [[original-post-discovery]] for [[readers]] and other uses like preferring to link to and display original [[comments]] instead of their POSSE copies.

== How to ==
When you post a [[POSSE]] copy, you should link to it at or near the end of the content of your POSSE copy with text like:

<blockquote>(Originally posted at : URL)</blockquote>
<blockquote>This was originally posted on my own site.</blockquote>

For shorter POSSE destinations like [[Twitter]] and [[Foursquare]], consider using a simple trailing [[permashortlink]].

Ideally you original post links should use <code>rel=canonical</code> as well.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has been posting original post links (as plain permashortlinks, and then later sometimes as [[permashortcitations]]) on his POSSE tweet copies [https://twitter.com/t/status/8228455558 since 2010-01-26].
* original post: http://tantek.com/2010/001/t1/declaring-independence-building-it
** POSSE tweet: https://twitter.com/t/status/8228455558

=== ... more examples ... ===
There are many more indieweb examples on specific silo POSSE pages that should be incorporated here, e.g.:

=== Jeremy Keith ===
{{adactio}} has been posting original post links to [[Medium]] copies of his posts since 2015-???.
* original post: https://adactio.com/journal/9814
** POSSE Medium post: https://medium.com/@adactio/home-screen-ffdda18b9de8
*** original post link text at end of post: <blockquote>This was originally posted on my own site.</blockquote> where the phrase “on my own site” is hyperlinked to the original.

== Service Examples ==
=== Bridgy Publish ===
[[Bridgy]] Publish has the option (default) of posting an original post link along with your POSSE copy.

E.g. POSSE [[Facebook]] copy: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101972337421793
has original post link text at end of post: <blockquote>(Originally published at: http://tantek.com/2015/318/t1/thoughts-friends-colleagues-paris)</blockquote> where the URL is in the text content and [[auto-link]]ed by Facebook
