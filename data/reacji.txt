'''<dfn>reacji</dfn>''' is an emoji [[reaction]], the use of a single emoji character in [[response]] to a [[post]], introduced as a feature by [[Slack]][http://slackhq.com/post/123561085920/reactions].

[[Slack]] was first to ship a built-in reacji feature that allows anyone to respond to any Slack message with a single emoji, which are then tallied like votes.
__TOC__
== Why ==
Why should you support receiving reacji and displaying them? So people can send you reacji and have it show up? E.g. a ðŸŽ‚ for your birthday.

== How to ==
=== How to markup ===
Markup a reacji response post as follows:

Post a [[reply]] where the content is a single [[emoji]] character.

=== How to receive and display ===
You can detect a reacji reply post by inspecting any incoming reply to see if it is a single emoji character.  
This is harder than it seems as there are many possible emoji sets and some emoji can consist of multiple characters combined.  Just looking for the single character emoji will cover most emoji however. 

* Be sure to remove whitespace as there may be some extra at the beginning or end unintentionally
* [[brid.gy]] backfeeds twitter replies with the @username at the front, you may want to strip this
* You may want to strip HTML tags to make sure they don't prevent you recognizing an emoji

Once you have detected the reacji and what emoji it is, display it as a reaction like you display [[likes]], followed by the count next to it or stamped on it like in the Slack example above.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of receiving and displaying reacji:
=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} has reacji in [[Postly]] as of 2015-12-16 (his birthday, send him a ðŸŽ‚) https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2015/12/8/2/

=== IndieWeb Reacji Posts ===
[[reply]] posts consisting of a single emoji character.
==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}} has been posting reacji [https://aaronparecki.com/replies/2015/12/16/2/ since 2015-12-16].

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has been posting reacji [http://tantek.com/2015/350/f1 since 2015-12-16].

** is also a [[like]] post (hence the /f in the URL) for fallback purposes, so that targets that understand likes but not reacji at least get the positive sense of the reacji being communicated. This method only makes sense for like-like reacji, but that's an acceptable limitation.

== Silo Examples ==
Besides Slack, individuals have started to post reacjis on other silos.

=== Twitter ===
Twitter seems ready to roll out official support for 'reacji' in the near future:

Until then, people have been experimenting on their own...

==== reacjweets ====
{{main|reacjweet}}
There are examples of individuals posting reacji as tweets ([[reacjweet]]s as it were)

==== emoji survey ====
A tweet author can simulate a limited curated set of reacji by posting a [[survey]] with only single-emoji responses. E.g.

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has reacji ([[Path]]-style, as a small set of emoji-like graphics) as an extension of "Like" since 2016-02-24.

* [https://medium.com/facebook-design/reactions-not-everything-in-life-is-likable-5c403de72a3f some concept/design background information]
Examples:
* https://www.facebook.com/tantek.celik/posts/10102142524051423 (requires login)

=== Path ===
[[Path]] has had limited reacji, as a small set of emoji-like graphics, since (??? their launch) years ago, and was likely the first silo to do so.

== Implementations ==
=== Libraries ===
* {{benthatmustbeme}} made a PHP library for determining if a string is a "single emoji" (a harder problem than it seems) available at https://github.com/dissolve/single-emoji-recognizer
