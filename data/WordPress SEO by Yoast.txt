'''<dfn>[https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ WordPress SEO by Yoast]</dfn>''' is a plugin for WordPress that offers a variety of features intended to improve [[SEO]].

== Features ==
* Additional fields "SEO Title" and "Meta Description" are added to each post. If filled in, the <code>title</code>, <code>meta</code>, and [[OGP]] meta elements will be filled in accordingly. WordPress uses its built-in title field to generate [[URL slugs]], so this separate set of fields can account for a different post title in the <code>title</code> element vs. the page heading and the URL slug.

==WordPress Criticisms ==

WordPress 4.1 introduced support for the [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/ title-tag] in October of 2014.

This resolved a four year old issue filed by Yoast, the creator of this plugin 

"Right now, title tags in themes are created by using wp_title and than adding on custom code, usually bloginfo('name'), sometimes other code. Because there's basically no way for a plugin to control the entire content of a title tag, all major SEO plugins resort to output buffering. "

The solution is pending.

"To maintain full forward compatibility, plugins can not check for theme support of title tags, and are discouraged from building functionality around it just yet. The long term plan is to enable users to manage document titles from their admin, independent of which theme theyâ€™re using. At that time it will also become more plugin friendly. To make sure this can be achieved however, it was important to rule out backwards compatibility concerns as much as possible."
