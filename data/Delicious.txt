'''<dfn>Delicious.com</dfn>''' (originally launched in 2003 at del.icio.us) is a [[bookmark]]s [[silo]] that was among the first to implement [[tags]], and user-tagging (AKA folksonomy), and present a UI of popular tags. Delicious was sold to [[Yahoo]] in 2005, neglected, then [[YouTube]] co-founders, and most recently to a former [[MySpace]] executive.[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/delicious-social-site-is-sold-by-youtube-founders]
