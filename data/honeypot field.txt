A '''<dfn>honeypot field</dfn>''' is a hidden form input that is intended to be left blank and spam bots will usually fill in, allowing you to filter out a lot of spam form submissions.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{gRegor}} has a honeypot field on the [[local comments]] form since 2016-03-21
** Borrowed from [[Known]]'s honeypot implementation
** <code>input type="text"</code> that is hidden with CSS <code>display: none;</code> and has placeholder attribute "If you are human, don't fill in this field."
** If the honeypot field is filled in, the comment attempt is logged but comment is not added to the post. The response message in the browser is the same as for regular, legitimate comments, "Thanks for commenting! Your comment is currently awaiting moderation." so there is no indication that the comment was caught by the honeypot.
