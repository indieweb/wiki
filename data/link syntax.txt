'''<dfn>link syntax</dfn>''' is a way of expressing a hyperlink with a URL and link text, in a plain text document, such as [[Markdown]], [[MediaWiki]] syntax, etc.

== Examples ==
=== Markdown ===
<pre>[linktext](URL)</pre>
==== Markdown criticism ====
* '''Not memorable'''
** {{aaronpk}} “I can barely ever remember the order of the markdown [] vs ()”<br/>“url first? text first? url goes in the round ones or the square ones?” (2016-04-27 IRC)
** {{gregorlove}} “I can never remember the right way to do links on github (whatever flavor of MD that is)” (2016-04-27 IRC)
** [https://twitter.com/evilgaywitch/status/512365234623758336 @evilgaywitch] “Only so many times you can forget how the fuck to do a link [in Markdown] before you just use raw HTML” (2014-09-17)

=== MediaWiki ===
<pre>
[externalURL linktext]
[[wikipagepath|linktext]]
</pre>
==== MediaWiki criticism ====
* '''Hard to remember'''
** {{bear}} “ is it [] or () or {} and is the text first or last”

== Usability considerations ==
* '''URL-first is better'''
** {{gregorlove}} “URL-first makes sense to me.”<br/>“Link text is optional, so makes sense to come after the link.”
** {{aaronpk}} “URL first makes sense cause it's the closest to the HTML I would write instead”
** {{kevinmarks}} “url[space]link text is easy to remember because you can't have spaces in URLs”
** counterpoint: {{bear}} “url first to me is wrong because i'm writing text and *then* want to have that text get a link”
*** {{t}} tends to agree. “I chose linktext before URL in my syntax, because the linktext is what a user is reading first and foremost more than the URL it links to”
