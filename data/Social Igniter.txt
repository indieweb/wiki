'''<dfn>[http://social-igniter.com/ Social Igniter]</dfn>''' aimed to be a lightweight, simple to setup, easy to extend, social content management system. What do you mean social CMS? We hope to make the task of managing / creating content more fun and social-like by using the aspects of social networks people have come to love.
