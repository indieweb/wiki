== my indie web setup is a work in progress ==
* http://dunlaps.net/darius is my primary home, but I also still do other stuff: 
** [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/dariusdunlap which then cross-posts to[[Facebook]]
** [[Facebook]] where I keep up with friends and family and promote http://squarepegfoundation.org
** [[Foursquare]] where I'm experimenting with presence
** [[Google+]] where I find some interesting people and conversations
* [[Tumblr]] - http://dariusdunlap.tumblr.com, where I sometimes post links
** [[Flickr]] - http://flickr.com/dariusdunlap, where I sometimes post pictures and videos
