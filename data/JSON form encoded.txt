{{stub}}

'''<dfn>JSON form encoded</dfn>''' is shorthand for offhand references to "just post JSON to the server" type expressions that appear to be used by [[cargo cult]] users of [[JSON]] and variants thereof, and has non-trivial implementation issues compared to the well-understood and well-supported plain [[form-encoded]] approach.

== Lack of support ==
JSON does not have as wide support for POST requests compared to [[form-encoded]] requests. 

In most web frameworks you have to jump through hoops to read the raw POST data if it's JSON format.

A Google search can confirm that lots of people are confused about how to handle JSON POST requests: [http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+receive+JSON+post+in+(php%7Cruby%7Cpython%7Cnode) how to receive JSON post in php, ruby, python, node]

== Imprecise - what MIME type ==
"JSON form encoded" is imprecise.

What MIME type are you supposed to use to upload? I.e. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4249609/form-content-type-for-a-json-http-post stack overflow confusion]
* application/json
* multipart/form-data
* or application/ld+json

* [[form-encoded]]
