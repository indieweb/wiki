=== Session Proposals ===
{{section-stub}}
If you have an idea for a session for IndieWebCamp Berlin, please add it below!
* {{jeremycherfas}} would like to think about IndieWeb photo pages and similar. Have requested a download of instagram data with a view to possibly implementing Gregor Randall's MementoMori, or something else.
** +1 {{t}}. May be worth reviewing past IWC photo related session notes / videos for ideas to build on:
*** [[2018/Berlin/photos]] ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGd1KNDXauw YouTube 47min]), [[2019/Berlin/pictures]], [[2019/Berlin2/whyphotos]], [[2022/Düsseldorf/photos]], [[2024/Brighton/pictures]], [[2024/Berlin/imagewriting]]
** +1 {{daniel}} Always happy to chat about photo sharing!
** +1 {{alabut}} Wrote up a quick post exploring different ways of organizing photos on personal sites and some brainstorming prompts: http://alabut.com/writing/photobrainstorming/
** {{addyourself}}
* {{daniel}} could give a demo of his [[FeedCity]] Feed Reader. It supports Web Sign-In/RelMeAuth and Webmentions, so this demo could focus more on demoing those directly IndieWeb-Tech related features.
** {{jeremycherfas}} would be interested. 
* {{jeremycherfas}} has just started using Tailscale and wonders whether that is of interest and whether anyone attending has a solid understanding of it.

== Health and Safety ==
<span id="Health_and_Saftey">{{emojicon|😷}}</span>
In order to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all, if you are feeling unwell, or have any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, we require that you participate remotely.

'''Before the camp''', we recommend:
* get fully vaccinated for COVID-19, including if possible the updated Fall 2025 booster
* bring <span id="rated_mask">KN95/FFP2, N95, or equivalently '''<dfn>rated mask</dfn>'''/respirator</span> that you’re comfortable wearing in meeting rooms
* take a Covid test before travel. we require remote-only participation if positive
* contact the [[#Organizers]] with any specific concerns / desires with respect to Health and Safety

In the '''5 days beforehand''' (i.e. October 26th-31st inclusive) please consider avoiding any situations that may risk exposure to contagious diseases, or at least wear a ''[[#rated_mask|rated mask]]'' if you must enter such a situation (e.g. going to a hospital, pharmacy, on taking transit of any sort).

'''En route''' to Berlin and the camp:
* If you are flying or taking a train to the IndieWebCamp to participate in person, please consider:
** In airports or stations: wear ''[[#rated_mask|rated mask]]'' at all times, except for any identity checks
** On the plane or train: wear a ''[[#rated_mask|rated mask]]'' at all times, except to briefly pull it down to take a sip of water/liquids.

'''Daily at the camp''', there will be good air circulation and masks available in the venue. In addition:
* Covid tests at sign-in. We have Covid tests at registration and we highly recommend everyone test when they sign-in. This is optional, yet every test helps!
* If you are feeling unwell, or have any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, you must participate remotely (not in-person)
* The venue recommends but does not require masking indoors
* Our main room has windows which we will open for fresh air
* Our room tables and chairs layout will permit sitting at 2m/6' distance if you prefer
* We recommend masking when indoors, and only removing a mask to take a sip from a drink
* We recommend eating only in the break area outside meeting rooms, or outside the building
* Speakers at the podium (e.g. when demonstrating) may remove their masks while speaking
* Note: there may be other venue workers (Mozillians) present who we are sharing the space with who are not under any requirements for masking etc.

'''Updates:''' similar to the [[2024/Berlin#|2024 IndieWebCamp Berlin]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Berlin 2025.
