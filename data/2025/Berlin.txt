Event:
🗓 https://events.indieweb.org/2025/11/indiewebcamp-berlin-oNMvxRpOvfEs

== Summary ==
{{emojicon|🎪}}
IndieWebCamp Berlin is an '''all-levels''' BarCamp-like collaboration in Berlin for '''two days''' of keynotes, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping '''gain more control over our data and lives online'''!

Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and – maybe more importantly – encourage all users to own their own content and identities.

Bring your laptop and mobile devices, we’ll help you get setup to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!

== Health and Safety ==
<span id="Health_and_Saftey">{{emojicon|😷}}</span>
In order to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all, if you are feeling unwell, or have any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, we require that you participate remotely.

'''Before the camp''', we recommend:
* get fully vaccinated for COVID-19, including if possible the updated Fall 2025 booster
* bring <span id="rated_mask">KN95/FFP2, N95, or equivalently '''<dfn>rated mask</dfn>'''/respirator</span> that you’re comfortable wearing in meeting rooms
* take a Covid test before travel. we require remote-only participation if positive
* contact the [[#Organizers]] with any specific concerns / desires with respect to Health and Safety

In the '''5 days beforehand''' (i.e. October 26th-31st inclusive) please consider avoiding any situations that may risk exposure to contagious diseases, or at least wear a ''[[#rated_mask|rated mask]]'' if you must enter such a situation (e.g. going to a hospital, pharmacy, on taking transit of any sort).

'''En route''' to Berlin and the camp:
* If you are flying or taking a train to the IndieWebCamp to participate in person, please consider:
** In airports or stations: wear ''[[#rated_mask|rated mask]]'' at all times, except for any identity checks
** On the plane or train: wear a ''[[#rated_mask|rated mask]]'' at all times, except to briefly pull it down to take a sip of water/liquids.

'''Daily at the camp''', there will be good air circulation and masks available in the venue. In addition:
* if you are feeling unwell, or have any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, you must participate remotely (not in-person)
* the venue recommends but does not require masking indoors
* our room tables and chairs layout will permit sitting at 2m/6' distance if you prefer
* recommend masking when indoors, and only removing a mask to take a sip from a drink
* recommend eating only in the break area outside the meeting rooms, or outside the building
* speakers at the podium (e.g. when demonstrating) may remove their masks while speaking
* note: there may be other venue workers (Mozillians) present who we are sharing the space with who are not under any requirements for masking etc.

'''Updates:''' similar to the [[2024/Berlin#|2024 IndieWebCamp Berlin]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Berlin 2025.
