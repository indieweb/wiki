Potential Dates:

* ✅ 2025-11-01…02 Saturday & Sunday before Beyond Tellerrand
** +1 {{t}} I could do this, and it’s a bit easier for making to W3C TPAC afterwards
** +0 {{martijnvdven}}
** +1 {{jo}} yeah probably
** +1 {{jeremycherfas}} possibly
** +1 [[User:Serverless.industries index|serverless.industries]] ([[User talk:Serverless.industries index|talk]])
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}
* 2025-11-08…09 Saturday & Sunday immediately after Beyond Tellerrand
** -1 {{t}} cannot make this due to having to participate at W3C TPAC in Japan on Monday the 10th (which is Sunday the 9th late Europe time, or early afternoon US time). If someone else drive finding a venue for Berlin and overall organizing the IndieWebCamp, then these dates would be easier for folks primarily traveling for btconf (and have no W3C TPAC responsibilities).
** +0 {{martijnvdven}}
