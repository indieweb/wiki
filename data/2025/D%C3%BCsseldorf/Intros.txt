== Tantek ==
{{t}}’s site is tantek.com. Most recently he blogged his second blog post in his Cybersecurity Friday series, using your personal site and domain to be more secure. He added to his site most recently:

Added redirects for 3rd party domains e.g.
* tantek.com/github/
* tantek.com/twitter/

Goal is to stop linking directly to silo permalinks, and wrap all site links to hyperlinks based on his domain, so when he imports and backfills all that data, he can change those links to redirect to his personal site and not direct viewers to [[social media]].

== Joschi ==
{{jkphl}}’s site is jkphl.is, same state as he left it at IndieWebCamp Berlin 2024. There is a bigger website behind this home page. Started his website 2014-01-01 with intention of writing lots of blog posts, wrote 7 blog posts in that time. Decided to pull the plug a year ago, as it did not reflect what he was doing in his life.

Thinking about how to shrink his site instead of expanding it.

Interested in getting rid of the [[CMS]] that was behind it, moving to something simpler.

Decided to go with ASCIIDoc as a format, it’s like Markdown.

He figured out one year ago at IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2024 how to do this. Didn't do much besides adding some content last November.

== Schepp ==
Schepp has a site at schepp.dev.

He didn’t have a website until 6 years ago at IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2019 where his website was born.

Feels like he is not updating it frequently enough, has managed to write one blog post a year maybe.

Another project he is working on is workingdraft.de and could maybe deepen the IndieWeb integration there.

== Daniel Pietzsch ==
{{daniel}} has a site at danielpietzsch.com.

Has a section with blog posts with every blog post. Also writes articles, notes, links, and video.

Also a /media section where he tracks movies, music, books he has read.

He posts movie [[watch]] posts via Letterboxd, via their RSS feed, [[PESOS]] to his site. Image photos are in the feed.

Last year at IndieWebcamp added an Upcoming Events think inspired by {{paulrobertlloyd}}. Sync to a live calendar and whatever is there gets put on his site.

Made it easier to post, made some iOS shortcuts to post notes to his site. That's an area he would like to improve. To be able to post more post types to his site from mobile devices.

Would also like to implement sending WebSub updates from his website. Might also look at his Webmention sending.

== Jakob ==
Jakob doesn't have a website yet.

Maybe if the laptop is working tomorrow, may have one by the end of tomorrow.

== Gunnar ==
{{gunnar}} shares a German quote that translates roughly to, whoever only works gets stupid, and whoever only makes art also becomes stupid.

has a site at https://gunnarbittersmann.de with various sections. songs, book club events. images are event posters that he uses for flyers. font on the poster is on the book as well.

also has a site https://bittersmann.de/startrek with data on various Star Trek series and their episodes. has to figure out the navigation of it. plot descriptions, reviews.

played around with YouTube API to start a bunch of Discovery season opening titles all at once so you can see the differences from season to season: https://bittersmann.de/startrek/artwork/discovery-opening-titles
 
shows a list of episodes from one of the series. the position:fixed footer disappears when you scroll and moves to the end of the list and can be scrolled into view that way.

also doesn't like when a menu at the top hides the top content when scrolling. uses intersection observer to observe the head element which is there in the DOM, makes it visible with display:block, hide all its children. so the line under the menu only appears when you scroll content under it.

== IndieWeb Movie Club ==
{{t}} shares one more thing: [[IndieWeb Movie Club]], every month someone in the IndieWeb community picks a movie that they want to host, encourages people to watch it and blog their impressions of it, then they do a roundup post of all the posts about that movie that month.

Showed the history of IndieWeb Movie Club, noted the May entry was empty as mentioned by Zachary in chat, and {{t}} volunteered for it. Showed his introduction post for the club. Different for this one, optional prequel book reading to read before watching the film, and then post about either or both.

== David Shanske ==
{{gwg}} does a remote personal site demo of https://david.shanske.com/.

Has a lot of features he likes to use on trips.

Has a "This Week" in history section at the top of his right sidebar.

When he goes on a trip, shows visit to Savannah Georgia and the map of him taking a walk, and accompanying pictures of where he walked.

Has an updated photo page with lots of photos, shows visiting Disney.

Has other sites that are linked in the sidebar, writes about technology, keyboards he has built.

Has a page where you can look at posts by location on his site. Shows his Düsseldorf page with various checkins from last year.

Only posts his location info when he is traveling. Also knows a few people who post things like that time delayed.

Also has a list of places that if he posts from there, it is automatically hidden, like his home.
