{{t}}: 
* ✅ fix his PHP to work PHP 8 (and https://asin.cc also! no more PHP7 on my host!) thanks {{schepp}}
* __ maybe implement "ISBN %ISBN%" auto-linking to open library, also urn:isbn:9780307476463 or isbn:9780307476463
** ✅ figure out a regex to detect ISBN usage in plain text
*** \b(ISBN-10(\s?:\s?|\s)|ISBN-13(\s?:\s?|\s)(978|979)|(ISBN|isbn)(\s?:\s?|\s)(978|979)?)(\s|-)?(\d(\s|-)?){9}(\d|X)\b
*** not supporting "ISBN-No.:" because the "No." is redundant like "Machine" in "ATM Machine" and should show as an error to the user
** ✅ document regex: https://indieweb.org/ISBN#Regex_to_detect_ISBN_usage_plain_text
