Notes from the [https://chat.indieweb.org/events/2025-05-04#t1746369719003300 chat logs]:

=== Tantek Çelik ===
* {{t}}, https://tantek.com/
* He did some house keeping stuff
* One thing he wanted to do today was to port his polyglot (JS/PHP) parsing libraries to PHP 8, which he did together with [schepp] and he succeeded. And he likes PHP 8 very much as it's a lot faster.
* The other project he had was to write a tool that would parse out [[ISBN]] numbers from a text and replace the text with the cover image of the corresponding book from [[Open Library]].
* And he succeeded with that, too. He developed a regex which would match all kinds of variations of writing down an ISBN

=== Dave ===
* https://letorey.co.uk/
* Next presenter is Dave who spontaneously joined the Indie Web Camp today
* Dave upgraded his personal website's static site generator to eleventy 3.0.1 and ES modules
* He then proceeded to have a change log automatically compiled into a list of changes

=== Calum Ryan ===
* {{calumryan}}, https://calumryan.com/
* also spontaneously joined this morning
* He focused on his personal web page which he built with [[Kirby]] CMS and which he likes to be as accessible as poissble.
* Today he took care of a lot of little things that he improved, like better markup for all the places that display dates
* He also moved certain things around to make it better for people who like to change their font size

=== Daniel Pietzsch ===
* https://danielpietzsch.com
* He connected his page to a [[WebSub]] hub in order to be able to send push notifications about updates to subscribers
* How that works is that during the build process ([[Jekyll]]) a POST request is ent to the hub which then proceeds to fetching the website's feed to discover new items and notify subscribers about those

=== Joschi Kuphal ===
* {{jkphl}}, https://jkphl.is/
* He was experimenting with methods to try to make his personal website more sustainable (even though it is a pretty simple one-pager)
* First he was playing around with different kinds of tools to measure the page's co2 footprint in order to be able to quantify progress he makes
* He found all kinds of tool that do that, like ecograder or the built-in Firefox energy profiler
* He found that the resuts of all these tools are rather flaky
* He started with 8 requests with 235 KB
* First thing was to recompress the image in another format (WebP) and he also replaced two fonts with one variable font.
* He then proceeded to implement three different (display) modes for his site. The first two were light and [[dark mode]], to which he added a black and white "eco" mode
* Reason being that OLED display use less energy the more black something is
* The black & white mode also allowed him to further compress the image by leaving away all color

=== Matthias Ott ===
* {{matthiasott}}, https://matthiasott.com/
* also joined spontaneously today
* He tried to fix a bug in a [[Webmention]] plugin for [[Craft CMS]]
* A few years back when he joined his first IWC, he created a Webmention plugin for Cratf CMS 2
* Since then he didn't update it, but recently got contacted by the Craft CMS creator himself who wanted to update the plugin together with Matthias
* They released it in March
* One of the improvements were the view in the backend
* Brandon, that creator did most of the programming, while Matthias helped with his knowledge about Webmentions and edge cases
* Matthias then proceeds to show all the "quality of life" improvements that went into the new version of it

=== Jakob ===
* http://jb-plurmedia.de/
* He created a tic tac toe game that he embedded on his page and that would store data in local storage
* He also wrote down a looong list of ideas and things to do

=== Christian Schaefer ===
* showed off a Tantek syntax (http://tantek.pbworks.com/w/page/59905776/Markdown) to HTML converter which he hacked together in a very short time with the help of ChatGPT
