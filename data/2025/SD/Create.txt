== Notes ==
* Welcome to Create Day! Day 2 of IndieWeb San Diego 2025!
* Schedule from Saturday: https://indieweb.org/2025/SD/Schedule

== Projects ==
=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} 
* Already completed reviewing PRs for the WordPress webmention page
* Exploring why my website won't let me upload photos suddenly and what to do about it.
* Uploading some photos I meant to upload while exploring how to fix the workflow.
* Someone submitted a PR for avatar photo upload in webmentions, which caused me to pivot to looking at that problem again.
* Wrote a new PR that allows the plugin to serve author photos for webmentions directly from the store, bypassing storing the local URL and degrades gracefully when disabled, then encouraged new commiter, if that is approved to help with that improvement. 

=== Tantek ===
{{t}}: create day ideas:
* ✅ create a [[card catalog]] page with IndieWeb Examples etc. from yesterday's session, and Brainstorming about minimum viable fields to get going with a personal card catalog.
* ✅ simple HTML for a card catalog
* simple HTML+CSS to display a card catalog card
* simple HTML+CSS to display a list of card catalog cards
* simple HTML+CSS to display a responsive grid of card catalog cards
* layout / design of a scalable card catalog card, minimum viable fields, something I can publish on my personal website 
* interested in helping with getting [[indiewebify.me]] updated to the point where it's easier for community members to work on issues and make drive-by improvements with a lower barrier to entry. I think we're currently here: https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82

=== gRegor ===
{{gRegor}} I don't currently have many goals, just lots of little things I could work on, given the right inspiration. Going to talk with Al later about microformats and [[photo]] posts, perhaps some micropub.

Might work on a draft of a blog post about a show I watched recnetly and really enjoyed/recommend.

=== {{artlung}} ===
* Blog post about the talk by the maintainer of PHP Codesniffer
* add my paper notes to the sessions on web past and future; and "concrete" of the web
* Work on a summary of my goals for how to create a workflow for making a catalog of web history resources

===vanderwal===
* Visual guide for understanding microformats to help those new to it understand good starting points, structure, and adding them to - rough draft - https://lab.vanderwal.net/visual_microformats.html
** Homepage 
** About page 
** Posts 
** found the microformat2 prefix definition (finally) - https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-prefixes

=== Joe ===
* {{artlung}}, https://artlung.com/
* https://artlung.com/blog/2025/12/14/life-happens-software/ blogged and transcribed notes from this talk he's really enjoyed
* https://artlung.com/mixtapes/chanukah-music/

=== gRegor ===
* {{gRegor}}, https://gregorlove.com/
* helped Al with microformats and photo brainstorming
* started a new page for causes I support and recommend: https://gregorlove.com/causes/
* started a draft of a blog post (nothing to show, just trust me!)

=== Al ===
* {{alabut}}, https://alabut.com
* got helped massively by Gregor and Anthony
* Gregor got me all set up with the full cycle for parsing the microformats
* demos pasting microformats into php.microformats.io, select "Render HTML", select "Save Page", that creates a temporary URL which can be pasted into Granary and converted to RSS. Finally, can paste the Granary link into Monocle Preview to see how it renders
* Anthony set up Sparkles for posting different stuff with micropub
* demos posting a note via micropub live!

=== Anthony ===
* {{aciccarello}} https://www.ciccarello.me
* Inspired by https://indieweb.org/2025/SD/opensource
* [https://www.ciccarello.me/blog/2025/12/14/indieweb-hackathon/ Posted announcement of a hackathon project]
* Created a https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Hackathon page
* Looking for project maintainers who want more community engagement
* Also want to work on improving the health of projects in indieweb/microformats repo
* See also https://indieweb.org/Category:Projects_that_need_maintenance

=== Tantek ===
* {{t}}, https://tantek.com
* Facilitated a session on personal library card catalogs yesterday https://indieweb.org/2025/SD/cardcatalogs
* {{chrisaldrich}} was there and was inspirational 
* Keeping track of physical and digital things, lovely photos have been added to the card catalogs page
* https://indieweb.org/card_catalog has lovely photos from Chris
* https://tantek.com/card-catalog.html (potentially temporary url) but is a space to experiment with card cataloging for Tantek, marked up with microformats, h-feed, h-cite, showed parsed microformats and how Monocle handles the h-feed even though it doesn't have explicit support for h-cite.
* next steps are to explore and experiment with CSS for card catalog card styling

=== David Shanske ===
* {{gwg}}, https://david.shanske.com/
* Experimented with photos, and multiple-photo layouts, sorting out
* https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention - did positive work doing code reviews and merging PRs in that repository, feedback on revisions
* Created code to allow for Avatars to be updated from the Avatar storage

===vanderwal===
* {{vanderwal}} https://vanderwal.net
* Visual guide for understanding microformats to help those new to it understand good starting points, structure, and adding them to - rough draft - https://lab.vanderwal.net/visual_microformats.html
** Started this with broader hopes
** Have an example using h-card for showing a "where is it used" on a page, what gets semantics / structure, and highlighting in the mark-up where the microformats get added as a class
