'''<dfn>Session Scheduling</dfn>''' for [[2025/SD|IndieWebCamp San Diego 2025]].

* Archived from: https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2025-12-13-iwc-sd

Scheduling took place by everyone making notes of what they were interested in facilitating, then adding votes for who was interested in each, and finally breaking them into time slots. The result is what ended up on [[2025/SD/Schedule]].
