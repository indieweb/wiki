=== Past ===
Joe's interest in the web of the past is to make sure a history of the web gets written and that people's stories get captured. There some history projects like for the Mac, but is anyone soliciting people's stories of how they use the web?

Richard Moss(?) is telling the history of readwriteweb.com

{{gwg}}: "My URL Is" podcast by Eddie Hinkle back in the day: https://indieweb.org/HELLO_my_URL_is

{{alabut}}: oral histories popular in other areas like music, film, documentaries, etc. seems less popular in tech
* Founders at Work by Jessica Livingstone

Startup dot com documentary

a question asking "which books should I read about ...?" is an obsolete late 1900s framing, especially about the history of the web

What stories should I know about the web? (instead of book)

Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States is a corollary to what Joe wants for the web

Hard to tell history (story) about something while it is happening.

Complement: best time to record history is while it's happening

=== Future ===

The current IndieWeb Carnival is "Imagine the IndieWeb in 2030"

Al says the spirit for having this discussion comes from a Pearl Jam lyric (to be filled in here). Maybe the future of the web is bright because it was actually really difficult in the old days. We tend to glorify the past because of all the other issues that happened on the corporate web.

If we take big tech off the table, his word for the web is "unkillable."

What does the future of the indieweb look like if the web is unkillable?

Brainstorm about what does a super bright future of the indieweb look like?

Tantek: "If all you have is HTML, all of this stuff should work together." an early guiding principle among the IndieWeb founders. 
* "HTML was our concrete."
* Wanted to build for longevity, not on different frameworks and formats that are currently popular

* Publishing on one's own website ensures content is available no matter what other apps (i.e. readers/social media apps) do
* Content creators have complete control over format and publishing
