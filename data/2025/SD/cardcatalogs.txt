Proposal notes here: https://indieweb.org/2025/SD/Sessions#Personal_library_card_catalogs

Who has a personal library of physical or digital books?
* everyone
Who has a list of every book they own?
* {{vanderwal}} - 500+ - [[Obsidian]] (this is partial documentation of physical book collection, 1200+ ebooks not captured) - Has captured physical books in LibraryThing and Delicious Library
* {{boffosocko}} - pretty complete ~2400 physical books, digital books 5000+, uses Goodreads bookscanner to scan ISBNs of books and put them into a "I own this book" shelf, list is on Goodreads, use that as a means of scanning, exported to an Excel spreadsheet; he uses [[Calibre]] to track his electronic books
* {{gwg}} - did track but out of date, was using LIbrary Thing, ~861 books in Library Thing, list is in Library Thing
* Vaughn - list of a very small subset, Obsidian, categorized by time period, genre, library emails

Tracking books you don't own (but have read, checked out etc.)
* {{alabut}} - tracks books from public library, will track personal owned collection after system is in place, Google Sheet for data extraction, library emails for data input, Notion and custom JS for web display

Chris mentioned using https://indieweb.org/Calibre for manging the ebook collection

* https://booklogr.app/ - Potentially promising self-hosted catalog option primarily for book progress tracking.
* https://github.com/pickles4evaaaa/mybibliotheca 
* https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore
* https://koha-community.org/

gRegor would like to track more. Uses Goodreads as a manual POSSE destination.
* https://indieweb.org/indiebookclub for posting to his website

{{t}} - have hundreds of books, but zero list of them digital or physical
* goals: both physical and digital card catalogs
* design phys/digital together
* designs of physical card catalog cards - can we re-use that design in digital realm?

{{boffosocko}} has a physical sample of a LoC card and checkout slips (photos coming)

What are the fields on the physical of a LoC card?

{{boffosocko}} - catalogs his books: by author:
* 1: author(s) on top line
* 2: title second line
* 3: publisher, publish location (city), year of publication (newer books day and date)
* 4: edition (1st, 2nd, ...), printing (number) of that edition (10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = first printing, 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 = second printing), hardcover or softcover or paperback or trade edition
* 5: pages and size (preface matter xliv for number of pages before page 1), number of numbered pages, measurement in cm of height of book
* 6: tracking numbers if exist in the book: ISBN, LoC (year + 6-7 digit number), LOC classification, Dewey Decimal classification
* 7: acquisition date, place paid for it, where purchased, condition purchased (new, good, very good, excellent, poor)

Most of this data is on the inside front cover of this book, only if in the book physically

Eventually would like to have everything cataloged by DDN or LoC but worrying about that later.

Then adds things when he reads the books.

{{alabut}} what's the purpose of this card catalog for you?

You go through your card catalog to see if you have a book?
* some of those cards have notes on the back whether it's been read or not

{{t}} keeps books on separate shelves for read and unread
* keeps purchase receipt with the book, inside the book

minimum viable card catalog card:
* author(s), title, date of acquisition, 
* scan barcode on the book to get most of these things (using Library Thing or Goodreads, which gives you exportable database)
* you may not need heavy cataloging of your stuff

TBD / hack projects:
* layout / design of a card catalog card, minimum viable fields, something I can publish on my personal website 
* Book scan-to-print workflow (, or obsidian ISBN lookup)
** Libray Thing scan
** GoodReads online service (owned by Amazon)
* OpenLibrary.org look-up by ISBN
* WorldCat.org



* {{vanderwal}} book card (not for notes) - https://vanderwal.net/images/book_card_obsidian.png
** Obdisian Templates - The Book Note is a larger and has prompts for notes and list of chapter links - https://github.com/vanderwal/Obsidian-Templates
** Sample markdown of BookNote with sections and structure with chapter links https://lab.vanderwal.net/Apple_in_China-Book_Note.mda

* [Soundex https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex] was an early algorithmic encoding which was patented for use with card index and encoding names. It was later taken over by Library Bureau, Melvil Dewey's company (inventor of the Dewey Decimal System). Soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms (in part because it is a standard feature of popular database software such as IBM Db2, PostgreSQL, MySQL,SQ Lite, Ingres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, ClickHouse, Snowflake and SAP ASE.)
