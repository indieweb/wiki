'''<dfn>Session ideas for 2025 SD</dfn>''' are ideas, suggestions, and brainstorming for day 1 sessions at [[2025/SD|IndieWebCamp 2025 San Diego]] on 2025-12-13.

== Personal library card catalogs ==
{{t}}: '''[[personal library]] card catalogs''', both virtual (on your personal site) and physical like the libraries we (some of us) grew up with.
* maybe co-facilitate with {{chrisaldrich}}?
* what would a plain text format / layout for a physical card catalog card look like? QR codes on the physical cards that link to the virtual cards?
* any prior art like a card catalog HyperCard stack? 
* if someone brings a typewriter and fitting card stock, could we make a few in the session?
* {{chrisaldrich}} has created an etherpad as a place to collect some ideas and examples in anticipation of this session https://etherpad.indieweb.org/p/card_catalogs
* {{alabut}} is also very interested and has been working on a way to sync his real life reading and paper notes with digital tracking tools for each.
** Made PDFs in Figma for tracking notes (could be OCR'ed into the Reader app or Obsidian, something both {{chrisaldrich}} and {{vanderwal}} have experience with)
** Prototyped an app to track library checkouts, due dates, etc, with live data scraped from notification emails.
** Future roadmap pt 1: has plans to make the library dates physical by building a "digital shelf" that has e-ink displays next to specific sections (e.g. books that are checked out, books that are overdue)
** Future roadmap pt 2: would like to incorporate non-library books by building a scanner, like {{capjamesg}} did with his [https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/22/photo-bookshelf Photo Bookshelf] project.

== Photos ==
{{t}}: '''[[photo]]s''' — would be interested in another discussion session on photos after the great [[2025/Berlin/photo|one in Berlin]]. 
* maybe co-facilitate with {{alabut}}?
* {{aciccarello}} +1 definitely interested 
* {{addyourself}}

== Book reads ==
{{aciccarello}}: How to publish book [[read]]s
* What to show on bookshelf and post pages?
* What content do people want to consume?
* Would an aggregator be helpful (see what friends are reading)?
* {{addyourself}}

== IndieWeb open source priorities ==
{{aciccarello}}: Priorities for IndieWeb open source contributions
* What projects should the community focus on?
* How to encourage use of community standards (better libraries? better test tooling?)
* Where are the gaps in current tools that limit adoption? (e.g. implementations of algorithms to make parsed microformats easier to use?)
* +1 {{t}} and even smaller steps like which projects should we highlight on https://github.com/indieweb (and possibly also https://github.com/microformats), i.e. re-assess [[pinned]] repos

== IndieWebify hack session ==
{{t}}: '''IndieWebify hack session''' — along with the open source contributions proposal, I'm specifically interested in helping with getting [[indiewebify.me]] updated to the point where it's easier for community members to work on issues and make drive-by improvements with a lower barrier to entry. I think we're currently here: https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82
