'''<dfn>Session ideas for 2025 SD</dfn>''' are ideas, suggestions, and brainstorming for day 1 sessions at [[2025/SD|IndieWebCamp 2025 San Diego]] on 2025-12-13.

== Personal library card catalogs ==
See session page at [[2025/SD/cardcatalogs]]  


== Photos ==
{{t}}: '''[[photo]]s''' — would be interested in another discussion session on photos after the great [[2025/Berlin/photo|one in Berlin]]. 
* maybe co-facilitate with {{alabut}}?
* {{aciccarello}} +1 definitely interested 
* {{addyourself}}

== Book reads ==
{{aciccarello}}: How to publish book [[read]]s
* What to show on bookshelf and post pages?
* What content do people want to consume?
* Would an aggregator be helpful (see what friends are reading)?
* {{addyourself}}

== IndieWeb open source priorities ==
{{aciccarello}}: Priorities for IndieWeb open source contributions
* What projects should the community focus on?
* How to encourage use of community standards (better libraries? better test tooling?)
* Where are the gaps in current tools that limit adoption? (e.g. implementations of algorithms to make parsed microformats easier to use?)
* +1 {{t}} and even smaller steps like which projects should we highlight on https://github.com/indieweb (and possibly also https://github.com/microformats), i.e. re-assess [[pinned]] repos

== IndieWebify hack session ==
* {{t}}: '''IndieWebify hack session''' — along with the open source contributions proposal, I'm specifically interested in helping with getting [[indiewebify.me]] updated to the point where it's easier for community members to work on issues and make drive-by improvements with a lower barrier to entry. I think we're currently here: https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82
* {{addyourself}}

== Notifications ==

{{gwg}} is interested in discussing [[notifications]], as he is trying to find out how to improve notifications. This includes:
* Delivery methods
* Clustering and combining notifications
* Identifying what you want to be notified about via website and beyond.
* Reducing noise

== add more session ideas here ==
