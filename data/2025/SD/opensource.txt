IndieWebCamp San Diego 2025<br>
Session: Open source development organizing<br>
When: 2025-12-13 17:15-17:45<br>
Hashtag: #opensource

== Participants ==
* {{aciccarello}}
* {{artlung}}
* {{gRegor}}
* Vaughn

== Intial Questions ==
What are the priorities for IndieWeb open source contributions?
* What projects should the community focus on?
* How to encourage use of community standards (better libraries? better test tooling?)
* Where are the gaps in current tools that limit adoption? (e.g. implementations of algorithms to make parsed microformats easier to use?)
** {{t}} and even smaller steps like which projects should we highlight on https://github.com/indieweb (and possibly also https://github.com/microformats), i.e. re-assess pinned repos

== Notes ==

* IndieWeb is very "start a project" friendly
* There are lots of projects but not all are maintained
* It is very informal for projects to get adopted
* There is no "community changelog"
* How do we know who can review/merge PRs on projects
* Can we have 2+ maintainers per project?
* Should review all community repos for open PRs

=== What do you look for in a project? ===
** Activity
** Stability
* How do you determine stability
** Unit tests
** Number of maintainers (more than 1 but not too many)
** Attention to detail in README

=== How do we get more engagement? ===
* Give incentives
** Google sumer of code
* "Software carnival" like a blog carnival
* Bug hunting parties
* Hackathon events

=== Proposal ===
* Annual review process
* List of top projects
* Importance (installs, activity)
* Clear readme (title, desc, test status, contact info, contribution guide, changelog)
* 2+ maintainers who are available within a few works
* A "stable" version number (1.0+)
* Compatible with latest language, framework, specs

=== How to get engagement ===
* Can we get code changes into "this week in the IndieWeb"
** New/closed issues
** # of commits
** releases/tags
** Grouped by language
* Start to track a list of projects on the wiki
* {{aciccarello}} could take on reviewing some projects
* IndieWeb code carnival where project maintainers sign up for a week to get engagement

== Conclusions ==
* Establish standards for community projects to be included in github org
* Encourage some standards for indiependent projects
* Update/organize list of projects on wiki
* Kick off indieweb code carnival
