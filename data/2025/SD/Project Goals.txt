__TOC__
== Project Goals ==

=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} 
* Already completed reviewing PRs for the WordPress webmention page
* Exploring why my website won't let me upload photos suddenly and what to do about it.
* Uploading some photos I meant to upload while exploring how to fix the workflow.
* Someone submitted a PR for avatar photo upload in webmentions, which caused me to pivot to looking at that problem again.
* Wrote a new PR that allows the plugin to serve author photos for webmentions directly from the store, bypassing storing the local URL and degrades gracefully when disabled, then encouraged new commiter, if that is approved to help with that improvement. 

=== Tantek ===
{{t}}: create day ideas:
* ✅ create a [[card catalog]] page with IndieWeb Examples etc. from yesterday's session, and Brainstorming about minimum viable fields to get going with a personal card catalog.
* ✅ simple HTML for a card catalog
* simple HTML+CSS to display a card catalog card
* simple HTML+CSS to display a list of card catalog cards
* simple HTML+CSS to display a responsive grid of card catalog cards
* layout / design of a scalable card catalog card, minimum viable fields, something I can publish on my personal website 
* interested in helping with getting [[indiewebify.me]] updated to the point where it's easier for community members to work on issues and make drive-by improvements with a lower barrier to entry. I think we're currently here: https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82

{{gRegor}} I don't currently have many goals, just lots of little things I could work on, given the right inspiration. Going to talk with Al later about microformats and [[photo]] posts, perhaps some micropub.
