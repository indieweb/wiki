* {{gRegor}}, https://gregorlove.com/
* helped Al with microformats and photo brainstorming
* started a new page for causes I support and recommend: https://gregorlove.com/causes/
* started a draft of a blog post (nothing to show, just trust me!)

=== Al ===
* {{alabut}}, https://alabut.com
* got helped massively by Gregor and Anthony
* Gregor got me all set up with the full cycle for parsing the microformats
* demos pasting microformats into php.microformats.io, select "Render HTML", select "Save Page", that creates a temporary URL which can be pasted into Granary and converted to RSS. Finally, can paste the Granary link into Monocle Preview to see how it renders
* Anthony set up Sparkles for posting different stuff with micropub
* demos posting a note via micropub live!

=== Anthony ===
* {{aciccarello}} https://www.ciccarello.me
* Inspired by https://indieweb.org/2025/SD/opensource
* [https://www.ciccarello.me/blog/2025/12/14/indieweb-hackathon/ Posted announcement of a hackathon project]
* Created a https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Hackathon page
* Looking for project maintainers who want more community engagement
* Also want to work on improving the health of projects in indieweb/microformats repo
* See also https://indieweb.org/Category:Projects_that_need_maintenance

=== Tantek ===
* {{t}}, https://tantek.com
* Facilitated a session on personal library card catalogs yesterday https://indieweb.org/2025/SD/cardcatalogs
* {{chrisaldrich}} was there and was inspirational 
* Keeping track of physical and digital things, lovely photos have been added to the card catalogs page
* https://indieweb.org/card_catalog has lovely photos from Chris
* https://tantek.com/card-catalog.html (potentially temporary url) but is a space to experiment with card cataloging for Tantek, marked up with microformats, h-feed, h-cite, showed parsed microformats and how Monocle handles the h-feed even though it doesn't have explicit support for h-cite.
* next steps are to explore and experiment with CSS for card catalog card styling

=== David Shanske ===
* {{gwg}}, https://david.shanske.com/
* Experimented with photos, and multiple-photo layouts, sorting out
* https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention - did positive work doing code reviews and merging PRs in that repository, feedback on revisions
* Created code to allow for Avatars to be updated from the Avatar storage

===vanderwal===
* {{vanderwal}} https://vanderwal.net
* Visual guide for understanding microformats to help those new to it understand good starting points, structure, and adding them to - rough draft - https://lab.vanderwal.net/visual_microformats.html
** Started this with broader hopes
** Have an example using h-card for showing a "where is it used" on a page, what gets semantics / structure, and highlighting in the mark-up where the microformats get added as a class
