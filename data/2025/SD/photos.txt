== Notes ==

* First we're cataloging what people do on their sites with photos.
** {{t}} https://tantek.com/photos

* {{gwg}} uses a photo grid https://david.shanske.com/photos that captures all photos in all posts and /kind/photo, expressly photo posts.

* Photo grids - [[photo grid]]
** pure grid with square icons or thumbnails
** Masonry grids of thumbnails or cards
* home page vs separate page

photo feeds

what posts go into your photo feed? at /photos
* any post that has photo
* only "photo" posts

separate page for *only* photos
* /kind/photo - {{gwg}}
*

clicking on a card/thumbnail takes you to the post with the photo

{{alabut}} has 
* /photos is list of albums
* click on album, goes to a named album e.g. /photos/mudfun
* each photo has has a fragment link within the album
** can use keyboard to click around back/forth like a slide show
** each one has a caption, intended to be portable
** each photo can be represented by a square, vertical, or horizontal. want to control how they look on different devices
** square looks better when unsure e.g. feed readers
** horizontal looks terrible on mobile
* pulling photos on own site to do responsive images

alabut.com/projects has links to different microformats he's using for feeds
* photo-feed - each photo gets its own post in the feed, but no separate link
* album-feed
* combined-feed

alabut.com/photos/feed - marked up with h-feed, feed of albums, one item per album, each item has multiple photos
* works in monocle preview 
* multiphoto = album in this case

{{boffosocko}} all these photos look like I'm living my best Instagram life

Al:
* wants to be able to take more photos of a certain kind
* current albums only "great" photos categorized by album
* how do I post both albums and individual photos without drowning out my best stuff?

{{boffosocko}} level of production is like hollywood tv show vs what came out of an instamatic
* in contrast to photos on checkins are more raw and immediate
* checkins go to private section on his website, data for himself

{{t}}
changes in practices of photo publishing
* "phd" digital cameras and mass uploading nightly - early Flickr / SXSW culture
* capture during the day without ever looking at them so you'd be super present in the moment
* then at night you'd do a mass dump of everything to flickr and facebook with everything tagged 
* early flickr had a lot of casual pics captured in the last few seconds
* this changed when IG came out because it kept the informalness but shifted the instant publishing, plus it had the filters
* next big changed is when IG went high quality, every pic becamse "glossy" magazine
* last big change is everyone's pics became A.I.-scrapable data abuse and ClearView surveillance face ID 
* {{t}} doesn't feel posting photos of other people's faces

* interesting underlying trends in cameras democratizing photography to more people

{{t}} would like to figure out friends-only or maybe indieauth'd only photos

{{gwg}} suggests 'ticket auth', the Ticketing Extension to IndieAuth



{{gwg}} wants to discuss what information you post with photos, similar to metadata.
