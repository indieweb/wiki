User story
* As an indieweb publisher, I would like tools / interfaces / materials I can learn once with expertise and use for as long as possible.

=== Goals ===
* persistence of *tooling* and/or *materials*
* once you've made it, it's not changing
* persistence of archives
* avoid churn of tooling

=== Recommendations ===
* Develop expertise in _writing_ in a chosen language ( English , Chinese , etc. )
* Prefer "core web" features ( html, gif, jpeg )
* Capture the context
** e.g. Archive your sources with archive.org / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Archive_your_sources
* Graceful downgrades ( e.g. Markdown with optional styling that can disappear )
* Teach and study subjects / tooling / interfaces that are persistent in utility
** e.g. Language, open source, publishing ideas ( recipes, photos, observations )
** e.g. Driving a vehicle is now a temporary skill
* Identify what is valuable to store & maintain
** Encourage multigenerational expertise
* Include experimentation as core value and skillset alongside ideas of stable tooling


=== Tooling vs materials ===
* Tooling
** Typewriter
** Text editor
** Web browser / html spec
** Screens / printers
* Materials
** English / multi-language
** Plaintext
*** Html / markdown / ...

=== Concrete as a metaphor ===
* Primary qualities
** "permanence" horizon ( ~100-1000 years vs 10,000+ years? )
** strength
* Optional qualities
** heavy
** resistent to change
** uniformity of material
* Uncertain qualities
** low-fidelity / precision
** slow to create
** cheap / expensive

== Similar materials ==
* Longer range - observed from Long Now 10,000 year context
** Special grades of stainless steel - Used for large components like gears and other structural parts.
* Titanium - Chosen for its strength and corrosion resistance.
* Ceramics - Specifically, dry-running ceramic ball bearings are used in the mechanism to reduce friction and wear.
* Quartz and Sapphire - These materials are used for precision components like the clock's timing mechanism and displays due to their hardness and stability.

* Letting go of "pixel perfect" design
* Responsiveness is key
* Semantic HTML is key
* Hand rolled sites typically are simpler (mayby not as legible)
* Some tooling is helpful for repeated parts of pages (e.g. headers/footers)
* If a tooling falls out of maintenance, a site could be un-buildable
* A statically built site's content should theoretically still be hostable
* A website is just a folder
* Overlap with personal card catalog - If I can't find a photo, it doesn't exist.

=== Anti-patterns ===
* Compiled / pre-processed patterns
* Javascript dependencies ( e.g. npm )
