'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2025</dfn>''', the '''ninth IndieWebCamp in Düsseldorf''', is 2025-05-03…04, the weekend before [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/dusseldorf-2025 btconf Düsseldorf 2025].

🗓 https://events.indieweb.org/2025/05/indiewebcamp-d%C3%BCsseldorf-lbBv9MGOChq2

== Summary ==
IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf is an '''all-levels''' BarCamp-like collaborative [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/dusseldorf-2025/side-events/indiewebcamp side-event before Beyond Tellerand Düsseldorf] for '''two days''' of intros, demos, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping '''gain more control over our data and lives online'''!

Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and – maybe more importantly – encourage all users to own their own content and identities.

Bring your laptop and mobile devices, we’ll help you get setup to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!

== Health and Safety ==
{{emojicon|😷}}
⚠️ Organizers are reviewing and discussing our Health and Safety rules. These are a draft and are subject to change based on the latest information. Regardless, bring a mask and plan to use it.

If you are feeling sick or experiencing any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, we require that you please participate remotely instead of in-person.

Masking 😷 recommended (but not required) both in-person inside the venue, and in transit (airports, flights, trains) to the venue.

Plan to bring N95 (or equivalent) respirator or KN95 (or equivalent like FFP2) masks to wear.

Neither the venue nor the subsequent Beyond Tellerand conference has any explicit health and safety rules, however we are recommending masking to help mitigate risks, both for IndieWebCamp participants, and for those we may interact with at Beyond Tellerand.

'''Updates:''' similar to the [[2024/Berlin|IndieWebCamp Berlin]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2025.
