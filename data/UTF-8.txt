{{stub}}

'''<dfn>UTF-8</dfn>''' is a way to encode Unicode characters in variable number of bytes per character. This is known as a ''multi-byte'' encoding scheme. UTF-8 is the most widely used encoding scheme for HTML pages on the web.<ref>https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/character_encoding/all</ref>

==Using UTF-8==
When writing your HTML, or your scripting language that generates the HTML (PHP, Python, etc.) set the encoding in your text editor to UTF-8. Then we need to tell the browser when it receives the HTML that we are using UTF-8. There are two ways of doing this. Firstly set the <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP response header, e.g.

<pre>
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
</pre>

Secondly to include the charset within the HTML document. The recommended way to do this in a HTML5 document is to use a <code>meta</code> tag early on like so:

<pre>
<!DOCYTPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    ...
</pre>
Warning, if these charset values donâ€™t match, the browser will prioritise the charset defined in the HTTP header over any charset defined within the document itself.
