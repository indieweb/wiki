'''<dfn>reuse</dfn>''' is the [[microformats]] principle of reusing building blocks from widely adopted standards.

== Brainstorm: Relation to [[principles]] ==
The [[principles]] of documenting and open source solutions and [[building-blocks]] is there to enable people to build on top of the experiences of others and to accumulate knowledge and patterns over time.

That in turn enables standards to slowly emerge among those documented approach, standards which may eventually become widely adopted, which in turn would make the a prime target for a '''reuse''' principle.
