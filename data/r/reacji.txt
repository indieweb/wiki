'''<dfn>reacji</dfn>''' is an [[emoji]] [[reaction]], the use of a single emoji character in [[response]] to a [[post]], introduced as a feature by [[Slack]][http://slackhq.com/post/123561085920/reactions].

For example:

[[File:slack many reactions.png]]

The row(s) of buttons with icons at the bottom indicate the reacji that the post has received, with the numbers inside them showing the counts of how many of each reacji has been received.

__TOC__

== Why ==
Why should you support posting reacji?

One great reason is to own your reactions(👍👎😆🎉😕❤️) to GitHub issues and comments by posting them on your own site and POSSEing (e.g. using [[Bridgy]]).
 
Why should you support receiving reacji and displaying them? 

So people can send you reacji and have it show up? E.g. a 🎂 for your birthday, or different kinds of reactions instead of just a "[[like]]".

== How to ==
=== How to display ===
Display a reacji post itself with [[reply-context]]. Because a reacji is so minimal, it may appear meaningless or misleading without additional context. But because reacji are small, a normal [[reply context]] would be presentationally overwhelming and look awkward.

The reply context for a reacji should be similar to the reply context for a [[like]], which tends to re-order the reply-context as the object of the like, rather than a header above it. At a minimum show the in-reply-to URL linked to itself, then additional information as it is available (e.g. name or summary of post), all of which can be wrapped in a <code>u-in-reply-to h-cite</code> hyperlink. Some sample hypertext designs:
* 👍 to http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2
* 👍 to [http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2 tantek.com’s post]
* 👍 to [http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2 CSS 2.2]

=== How to markup ===
Markup a reacji response post as follows:

Post a [[reply#Post_a_reply|reply (How to markup)]] where the content is a single [[emoji]] character. Thus <code>[[u-in-reply-to]]</code> is required.

Note: if there is HTML in the content property, it may mess with [[emoji]] detection, so you should use <code>p-content</code>, rather than <code>e-content</code> for reacji reply posts.

<pre>
<p class="h-entry">
 <span class="p-name p-content">👍</span>
 to 
 <a class="u-in-reply-to h-cite" 
    href="http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2">CSS 2.2</a>
 ...
 <a class="u-url"
    href="...permalink of post...">
  <time class="dt-published">2018-05-01 11:00-0700</time>
 </a>
</p>
</pre>

Can use div or li or even span instead of (or around) the p element depending on what works for your site and context, e.g. on a permalink or in-stream. Note the reply-context comes after the content which is atypical for reply-context hypertext design/markup in general.

In addition, if your reacji is at least a somewhat positive approval, you may want to add a <code>u-like-of</code> class (in addition to <code>u-in-reply-to</code>) to your link to the original post, so that even if the receiver only supports likes, they can count your response as a like, until they add support for receiving reacji.

(complete h-entry reacji as a positive response code example would be nice here, perhaps with a thumbs-up or heart or smileyface emoji)

=== How to receive and display reacjis ===
You can detect a reacji reply post by inspecting any incoming reply to see if it is a single emoji character.  
This is harder than it seems as there are many possible emoji sets and some emoji can consist of multiple characters combined.  Just looking for the single character emoji will cover most emoji however. 

* Be sure to remove whitespace as there may be some extra at the beginning or end unintentionally
* [[brid.gy]] backfeeds twitter replies with the @username at the front, you may want to strip this
* You may want to strip HTML tags to make sure they don't prevent you recognizing an emoji

Once you have detected the reacji and what emoji it is, display it as a reaction like you display [[likes]], followed by the count next to it or stamped on it like in the Slack example above.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of receiving and displaying reacji:

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} has reacji in [[Postly]] as of 2015-12-16 (his birthday, send him a 🎂) https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2015/12/8/2/

=== Greg V ===
{{myfreeweb}} has been displaying reacji [https://unrelenting.technology/notes/2016-03-23-11-16-48 since 2016-03-21].

=== IndieWeb Reacji Posts ===
IndieWeb examples of [[reply]] posts consisting of a single emoji character.

If you also receive and display reacjis from others on your posts in some special way different from comments e.g. a [[facepile]], then add yourself above to the main IndieWeb Examples section!

==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}} has been posting reacji [https://aaronparecki.com/replies/2015/12/16/2/ since 2015-12-16].
* https://aaronparecki.com/replies/2015/12/16/2/

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has been posting reacji [http://tantek.com/2015/350/f1 since 2015-12-16].
* http://tantek.com/2015/350/f1
** is also a [[like]] post (hence the /f in the URL) for fallback purposes, so that targets that understand likes but not reacji at least get the positive sense of the reacji being communicated. This method only makes sense for like-like reacji, but that's an acceptable limitation.
More recently ([http://tantek.com/2018/103/t1/ since 2018-04-13]), reacji being posted as [[reply]] posts with a single emoji, e.g.:
* http://tantek.com/2018/103/t1/

[http://tantek.com/2018/122/t2/ Since 2018-05-02], showing in-stream mini-reply-contexts of the form:
<blockquote>👍 to issue 2588 of GitHub project “csswg-drafts”</blockquote>

==== Peter Molnar ====
{{petermolnar}} used to display reacji with Wordpress, then had them removed; now they are back again, but since it's a static site, they are display with significant delays - 2017-06-01

(permalinks needed that show displaying reacji from others)

==== Marty McGuire ====
{{martymcguire}} has been posting reacji [https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/23/223002/ since at least 2017-10-23].
* Post is [[in-reply-to]] the original post
* Content is single emoji character

== Silo Examples ==
Besides Slack, individuals have started to post reacjis on other silos.

=== Slack ===
Slack showing reactions:

=== Twitter ===
Twitter seems ready to roll out official support for 'reacji' in the near future: 
* http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/16/9745744/twitter-emoji-reactions

Until then, people have been experimenting on their own...

==== reacjweets ====
{{main|reacjweet}}
There are examples of individuals posting reacji as tweets ([[reacjweet]]s as it were)
* https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/661802300407545856

==== emoji survey ====
A tweet author can simulate a limited curated set of reacji by posting a [[survey]] with only single-emoji responses. E.g.
* https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/683055062873079808

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has reacji ([[Path]]-style, as a small set of emoji-like graphics) as an extension of "[[like|Like]]" and calls them [[reactions]]. Supported since 2016-02-24 on posts, and since 2017-05-03 on comments. emoji and text (on hover) equivalents:
* 👍 like
* ❤️ love
* 🌸 (purple) flower - temporary [http://time.com/4322307/facebook-flower-reaction-mothers-day/ Time 2016], [https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/13/15635974/mothers-day-thankful-facebook-camera-flower-reaction-instagram The Verge 2017]

2017-05-03 New feature prompt to "React to a [[comment|Comment]]":

[[File:2017-05-03-fb-new-react-to-comment.png]]

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] also supports a small set of reacji in response to pull requests, issues, and comments (and calls them [[reactions]]), [https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments since 2016-03-10]:
* 👍 +1
* 👎 -1
* 😆 Laugh
* 🎉 Hooray
* 😕 Confused
* ❤️ Heart

You can [https://brid.gy/about#github-reaction POSSE these to GitHub using Bridgy Publish].

More:
* https://help.github.com/articles/about-conversations-on-github/#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments (screenshot in that page shows a crying emoji but doesn't appear to be currently supported)

=== Path ===
[[Path]] has had limited reacji, as a small set of emoji-like graphics, since (??? their launch) years ago, and was likely the first silo to do so.

(need screenshot)

=== Basecamp ===
[[Basecamp]] replaces their previous “like” functionality with “boosts” which aim to merge reacji with short text reactions and avoids counts. They also only show the boosts to the author, not to others.
[This article https://m.signalvnoise.com/introducing-boosts-an-all-new-way-to-show-your-support-in-basecamp-fae325634998] should probably be analyzed more and summarized best practices and indieweb relevant pieces entered in here.

(Need screenshot)

== Implementations ==
=== Libraries ===
"single emoji" detection:
* {{benthatmustbeme}} made a PHP library for determining if a string is a "single emoji" (a harder problem than it seems) available at https://github.com/dissolve/single-emoji-recognizer ([[selfdogfood]]ing on his own site)
* {{t}} wrote a ~25 line PHP function with a heuristic for determining if a string is a "single emoji" - simpler yet more approximate, catches common cases, likely to handle future emoji expansions too: <code>function is_one_emoji($s)</code> in https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis-lab.php ([[selfdogfood]]ing on his own site)

[[Facebook]] reactions to reacji:
* [[granary]] can fetch and convert [[Facebook]] reactions to reacji.

=== Services ===
* [[Bridgy]] [[backfeed]]s [[Facebook]] reactions as of 2016-04-28. [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/626 Details.]
* [[Bridgy]] Publish supports [[POSSE]]ing reactions to [[Github]]

== Brainstoming ==
=== Reply Context ===
{{t}} thoughts on reacji reply context design, deployed since brainstorming, have been incorporated into "[[#How_to_display|How to display]]" above.

== Criticism ==
* We should call this [[reactions]] instead of reacji. The rest of the industry already does - [[Slack]], [[Facebook]], [[GitHub]], etc. Common terminology is more valuable than minor semantic differences. (Lots more discussion [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-04-29#t1461959269173 in IRC].) - {{snarfed}}

== History ==
=== Slack reacji ===
[[Slack]] was first to ship a built-in reacji feature that allows anyone to respond to any Slack message with a single emoji, which are then tallied like votes.
