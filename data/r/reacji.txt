'''<dfn>reacji</dfn>''' is an [[emoji]] [[reaction]], the use of a single emoji character in [[response]] to a [[post]], introduced as a feature by [[Slack]][http://slackhq.com/post/123561085920/reactions].


For collections of reacjis and examples see 
{{main|reacjis}}

== Why ==
Why should you support posting reacji posts?

One great reason is to own your reactions(👍👎😆🎉😕❤️🚀👀) to GitHub issues and comments by posting them on your own site and POSSEing (e.g. using [[Bridgy]]).

== How to ==
=== How to display ===
Display a reacji post itself with [[reply-context]]. Because a reacji is so minimal, it may appear meaningless or misleading without additional context. But because reacji are small, a normal [[reply context]] would be presentationally overwhelming and look awkward.

The reply context for a reacji should be similar to the reply context for a [[like]], which tends to re-order the reply-context as the object of the like, rather than a header above it. At a minimum show the in-reply-to URL linked to itself, then additional information as it is available (e.g. name or summary of post), all of which can be wrapped in a <code>u-in-reply-to h-cite</code> hyperlink. Some sample hypertext designs:
* 👍 to http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2
* 👍 to [http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2 tantek.com’s post]
* 👍 to [http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2 CSS 2.2]

=== How to markup ===
Markup a reacji response post as follows:

Post a [[reply#Post_a_reply|reply (How to markup)]] where the content is a single [[emoji]] character. Thus <code>[[u-in-reply-to]]</code> is required.

Note: if there is HTML in the content property, it may mess with [[emoji]] detection, so you should use <code>p-content</code>, rather than <code>e-content</code> for reacji reply posts.

<pre>
<p class="h-entry">
 <span class="p-name p-content">👍</span>
 to 
 <a class="u-in-reply-to h-cite" 
    href="http://tantek.com/2018/102/t9/css-2-2">CSS 2.2</a>
 ...
 <a class="u-url"
    href="...permalink of post...">
  <time class="dt-published">2018-05-01 11:00-0700</time>
 </a>
</p>
</pre>

Can use div or li or even span instead of (or around) the p element depending on what works for your site and context, e.g. on a permalink or in-stream. Note the reply-context comes after the content which is atypical for reply-context hypertext design/markup in general.

In addition, if your reacji is at least a somewhat positive approval, you may want to add a <code>u-like-of</code> class (in addition to <code>u-in-reply-to</code>) to your link to the original post, so that even if the receiver only supports likes, they can count your response as a like, until they add support for receiving reacji.

(complete h-entry reacji as a positive response code example would be nice here, perhaps with a thumbs-up or heart or smileyface emoji)

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} supports individual reacji posts in [[Postly]] [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2015/12/16/1/ since 2015-12-16] (his birthday, send him a 🎂)

==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}} has been posting reacji [https://aaronparecki.com/replies/2015/12/16/2/ since 2015-12-16].

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has been posting reacji [http://tantek.com/2015/350/f1 since 2015-12-16].
* http://tantek.com/2015/350/f1
** is also a [[like]] post (hence the /f in the URL) for fallback purposes, so that targets that understand likes but not reacji at least get the positive sense of the reacji being communicated. This method only makes sense for like-like reacji, but that's an acceptable limitation.
More recently ([http://tantek.com/2018/103/t1/ since 2018-04-13]), reacji being posted as [[reply]] posts with a single emoji, e.g.:
* http://tantek.com/2018/103/t1/

[http://tantek.com/2018/122/t2/ Since 2018-05-02], showing in-stream mini-reply-contexts of the form:
<blockquote>👍 to issue 2588 of GitHub project “csswg-drafts”</blockquote>

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} sends reacji [https://seblog.nl/2017/02/20/4/day-36-reacji since 2017-02-20]

==== Peter Molnar ====
{{petermolnar}} used to display reacji with Wordpress, then had them removed; now they are back again, but since it's a static site, they are display with significant delays - 2017-06-01

(permalinks needed that show displaying reacji from others)

==== Marty McGuire ====
{{martymcguire}} has been posting reacji [https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/23/223002/ since at least 2017-10-23].
* Post is [[in-reply-to]] the original post
* Content is single emoji character

== Silo Examples ==

=== Twitter ===
Twitter seemed ready to roll out official support for 'reacji' but it was never widely released: 
* http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/16/9745744/twitter-emoji-reactions

Without official support people have been experimenting on their own...

==== reacjweets ====
{{main|reacjweet}}
There are examples of individuals posting reacji as tweets ([[reacjweet]]s as it were)
* https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/661802300407545856

==== emoji survey ====
A tweet author can simulate a limited curated set of reacji by posting a [[survey]] with only single-emoji responses. E.g.

== Implementations ==
=== Services ===
* [[Bridgy]] Publish supports [[POSSE]]ing reactions to [[Github]]

== Brainstoming ==
=== Reply Context ===
{{t}} thoughts on reacji reply context design, deployed since brainstorming, have been incorporated into "[[#How_to_display|How to display]]" above.

== Criticism ==
* We should call this [[reactions]] instead of reacji. The rest of the industry already does - [[Slack]], [[Facebook]], [[GitHub]], etc. Common terminology is more valuable than minor semantic differences. (Lots more discussion [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-04-29#t1461959269173 in IRC].) - {{snarfed}}
* +1 {{aciccarello}} Totally agree. Reactions is more in line with what I'd call similar features.

Today, they include “like,” “love,” “care,” “haha,” “wow,” “sad,” and “angry.” Company researchers had found that the <strong>posts dominated by “angry” reactions were substantially more likely to go against community standards, including prohibitions on various types of misinformation</strong>, according to internal documents.</blockquote> from https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/, <strong>emphasis</strong> added
