'''<dfn>routing</dfn>''' (or <dfn>URL routing</dfn>) is a way to configure a website to have some (or all) of its URLs handled by software rather than static files; an IndieWeb site may have no routing (a [[static site]]), some routing like one directory handled by [[PHP]] or other software, or all URLs handled by a framework like [[Ruby on Rails]] with its own routing system.
