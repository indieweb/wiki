'''<dfn>routing</dfn>''' is a term that refers to ensuring well-structured requests, are met with the desired, perhaps expected content.

Most content routers work by associating groups of characters, matching a format specification known as URIs, with content producers when dealing with HTTP. Similarly the term routing has it's roots in other forms of communication including telephony and physical mail.

There are many ways to route, but the concept is based on taking something addressable and ensuring it gets to a destination.

The concept is equally as applicable between static and dynamic publishing, or web application contexts.

The concept is important, because it enables one machine to service many different structured responses.

== File based routing ==

This is one of the simplest types of routing that exists. It extends the content provider operating system file structure [partially] to the visitor. If a file exists, then barring permissions set by the content provider; the visitor will have access to read.

== Dynamic routing ==

In order to support an alternative representation of characters than the host operating system file-system, read from external systems, such as databases and other remote-storage; some systems use a method of associating characters with algorithm-designated content.

== Centralized routing ==

Some applications extend the principle of dynamism, with a single file, responsible for ensuring well-formed requests get to their locations. Ancillary functionality such as access-control, error handling, redirection may also be part of this file, but that is not a requirement for this pattern.
