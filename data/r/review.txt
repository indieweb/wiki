A '''<dfn>review</dfn>''' is an evaluation of a product or service, usually involving a written description, but can also be limited to a numerical scale.

== Why ==
You should own your reviews, just like you own your [[comment]]s.

== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Current review publishing best practice is to post an [[h-review]] as you would otherwise post an [[h-entry]].

(markup example needed)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Shane Becker ===
{{veganstraightedge}} has posted reviews as [[articles]], without explicit h-review markup: http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/5/review-y-the-last-man http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/4/review-dmz http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/3/review-ultimate-spiderman http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/2/review-powers

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has posted reviews with h-review markup as of 2017-04-02. My intent was initially to post an [[recipe]] with a link to Blue Apron recipes I've enjoyed, then I realized it was easy to wrap in an h-review at the same time:
* https://gregorlove.com/2017/04/pan-seared-chicken-with-roasted-honeynut/

Previously I had posted a review as an [[article]], without explicit h-review markup: 
* http://gregorlove.com/2015/08/review-a-thousand-lives/

=== Kyle Mahan ===

== Silo Examples ==
=== Amazon ===
{{main|Amazon Reviews}}

[[Amazon]] is a review and ratings silo of sorts, in that they have a UI for creating reviews/ratings and host them on their own site.

=== AirBnB ===
{{main|AirBnB Reviews}}

[[AirBnB]] also hosts reviews in addition to its primary use-case.

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] allows posting of reviews as a response to a pull request. E.g.
* https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/pull/66#pullrequestreview-101356976

When you're looking at a pull request on GitHub, the Files changed tab in particular, there's a "Review changes" drop-down in the topright of the view of the diffs. 

Clicking it shows:
* "Review summary" text field, 
* as well as radio group for 
** ( ) Comment 
** ( ) Approve 
** ( ) Request changes, and then 
* a "Submit review" button
