A '''<dfn>review</dfn>''' is an evaluation of a product or service, usually involving a written description, but can also be limited to a numerical scale.

== Why ==
You should own your reviews, just like you own your [[comment]]s.

== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Current review publishing best practice is to post an [[h-review]] as you would otherwise post an [[h-entry]].

(markup example needed)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Shane Becker ===
{{veganstraightedge}} has posted reviews as [[articles]], without explicit h-review markup: http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/5/review-y-the-last-man http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/4/review-dmz http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/3/review-ultimate-spiderman http://veganstraightedge.com/articles/2006/11/18/2/review-powers

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has posted a review as a [[note]], without explicit h-review markup: http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2015/06/23/1/echo
* since 2016-12-15, he added [[h-review]] support to [[p3k]] and [[Quill]] and now can post reviews with Microformats 2 and 1 markup
* e.g. https://aaronparecki.com/2016/12/15/11/bose-solo-15-sound-system-review
* all: https://aaronparecki.com/reviews

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has posted reviews with h-review markup as of 2017-04-02. My intent was initially to post an [[recipe]] with a link to Blue Apron recipes I've enjoyed, then I realized it was easy to wrap in an h-review at the same time:
* https://gregorlove.com/2017/04/pan-seared-chicken-with-roasted-honeynut/

Previously I had posted a review as an [[article]], without explicit h-review markup: 
* http://gregorlove.com/2015/08/review-a-thousand-lives/

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} has posted reviews with explicit h-review markup

* all: https://kylewm.com/reviews/

=== Christian Weiske ===

== Silo Examples ==
=== Amazon ===
{{main|Amazon Reviews}}

[[Amazon]] is a review and ratings silo of sorts, in that they have a UI for creating reviews/ratings and host them on their own site.

=== Goodreads ===
{{main|Goodreads}}

[[Goodreads]] is a [[silo]] for keeping track of [[books]], reviews, and reading progress. [[Amazon]] purchased Goodreads in 2013.

=== Yelp ===
{{main|Yelp}}
[[Yelp]] is a [[review]] [[silo]] that also allows for [[checkins]].

=== AirBnB ===
{{main|AirBnB Reviews}}

[[AirBnB]] also hosts reviews in addition to its primary use-case.

=== Letterboxd ===
{{main|Letterboxd}}

[[Letterboxd]] is a [[silo]] for keeping track of films and [[review|reviews]] in what they call a "film diary".

=== IMDB ===
[[IMDb]] is a large film and television database and [[silo]] that allows for rating content, writing [[review|reviews]], creating [[want|watchlists]], and adding [[watch|media checkins]] among other functionalities.

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] allows posting of reviews as a response to a pull request. E.g.
* https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/pull/66#pullrequestreview-101356976

When you're looking at a pull request on GitHub, the Files changed tab in particular, there's a "Review changes" drop-down in the topright of the view of the diffs. 

Clicking it shows:
* "Review summary" text field, 
* as well as radio group for 
** ( ) Comment 
** ( ) Approve 
** ( ) Request changes, and then 
* a "Submit review" button

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE to GitHub ===
It would be great to be able to post a review of a pull request to my own site, and POSSE it to GitHub, though this requires at a minimum marking up:
* review summary/content - which [[h-review]] (and [[h-entry]] for that matter) already supports
* choice of comment/approve/request changes
** "comment" could just be the silent default - no other markup needed. just an h-review with content should work to make this work.
** "approve" needs some explicit indication.
*** use a tag? <nowiki><span class="p-category">approve</span></nowiki>
*** similarly: <nowiki><span class="p-category">changes</span></nowiki> for request changes
*** or a custom rating field per [[h-review]]?
*** or ... ?

Next steps:
* figure out some markup (perhaps gather at least one more silo example for which the markup would make sense)
* experiment with a manual pull request review on an indieweb site
* experiment with manually POSSEing it to GitHub
* file an issue on [[Bridgy]] Publish to support POSSEing [[h-review]] posts of GitHub pull request URLs. Or perhaps allow minimum viable [[comment]] + special-tags for Bridgy to detect. Or encourage / allow both? (why? why not just use the minimum makrup that would work?)
