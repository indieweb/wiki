A '''<dfn>review</dfn>''' is a [[post]] evaluating a product, service, or experience, usually involving a written description, sometimes with summary numerical evaluations, also known as just a [[rating]] if it‚Äôs just a single numerical value or iconic representation like stars (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ).

== Why ==
You should own your reviews, just like you own your [[comment]]s.
__TOC__
== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Current review publishing best practice is to post an [[h-review]] as you would otherwise post an [[h-entry]].

(markup example needed!)

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has posted reviews with h-review markup as of 2017-04-02. 

A more recent example of a book review:
* https://gregorlove.com/2023/11/review-live-wire/

My intent was initially to post a [[recipe]] with a link to Blue Apron recipes I've enjoyed, then I realized it was easy to wrap in an h-review at the same time:
* https://gregorlove.com/2017/04/pan-seared-chicken-with-roasted-honeynut/

Previously I had posted a review as an [[article]], without explicit h-review markup: 
* http://gregorlove.com/2015/08/review-a-thousand-lives/

=== Christian Weiske ===
{{cweiske}} has posted reviews with Microformats 1 hreview classes

=== Dan Q ===
	 
{{danq}} added h-review reviews to his site [https://danq.me/2019/09/30/indiewebcamp-oxford-2019/ in 2019], retroactively [[PESOS]]-importing reviews from several silos, e.g.:

* [https://danq.me/2015/08/29/review-of-the-feathers/ Review imported from TripAdvisor] with out-of-5 rating and h-card; note that TripAdvisor allows reviews to report on multiple 5-point scales but this isn't reflected in my site (yet)
* [https://danq.me/2016/11/25/review-of-raw-data/ Review imported from Steam] with "recommended"/"not recommended" (0-1) rating and basic h-product

=== Kelson Vibber ===
{{kvibber}} has been consolidating reviews from his blog(s) and various silos such as Amazon, Yelp, and even Google+. Since 2021 the [https://hyperborea.org/reviews/ reviews section of his website] uses h-review and microformat-enabled ratings, and (manually) POSSEs out new posts to silos.
* [https://hyperborea.org/reviews/comics/chivalry/ Graphic novel review] showing ratings and syndication links to POSSE'd copies.
* [https://hyperborea.org/reviews/books/under-the-influence/ Slightly older book review imported from Amazon], now treating the website copy as canonical.
* [https://hyperborea.org/reviews/theater/glass-mendacity/ Older theater review imported from blog], still pointing to the original post as canonical.

=== Brian Tremblay ===
Brian Tremblay publishes music reviews on his site:
* https://btrem.com/2021/09-lee-perry-recommendations A short h-feed of a handful of reviews of reggae records.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Amazon ===
{{main|Amazon Reviews}}

[[Amazon]] is a review and ratings silo of sorts, in that they have a UI for creating reviews/ratings and host them on their own site.

=== Goodreads ===
{{main|Goodreads}}

[[Goodreads]] is a [[silo]] for keeping track of [[books]], reviews, and reading progress. [[Amazon]] purchased Goodreads in 2013.

=== Yelp ===
{{main|Yelp}}
[[Yelp]] is a [[review]] [[silo]] that also allows for [[checkins]].

=== AirBnB ===
{{main|AirBnB Reviews}}

[[AirBnB]] also hosts reviews in addition to its primary use-case.

=== Letterboxd ===
{{main|Letterboxd}}

[[Letterboxd]] is a [[silo]] for keeping track of films and [[review|reviews]] in what they call a "film diary".

=== IMDB ===
[[IMDb]] is a large film and television database and [[silo]] that allows for rating content, writing [[review|reviews]], creating [[want|watchlists]], and adding [[watch|media checkins]] among other functionalities.

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] allows posting of reviews as a response to a pull request. E.g.
* https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/pull/66#pullrequestreview-101356976

When you're looking at a pull request on GitHub, the Files changed tab in particular, there's a "Review changes" drop-down in the topright of the view of the diffs. 

Clicking it shows:
* "Review summary" text field, 
* as well as radio group for 
** ( ) Comment 
** ( ) Approve 
** ( ) Request changes, and then 
* a "Submit review" button

=== Google Maps ("Google Places") ===
	 
Reviews posted about places registered on Google My Business appear on Google Maps, via their app, etc. They have individual URLs which could be useful for syndication, e.g. https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103645469476905576119/place/ChIJlYd0JcPEdkgRua5jm4pBRBA. Being as they're reviews of businesses with real locations, reviews of this kind might benefit from [[h-card]] metadata.

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE to GitHub ===
It would be great to be able to post a review of a pull request to my own site, and POSSE it to GitHub, though this requires at a minimum marking up:
* review summary/content - which [[h-review]] (and [[h-entry]] for that matter) already supports
* choice of comment/approve/request changes
** "comment" could just be the silent default - no other markup needed. just an h-review with content should work to make this work.
** "approve" needs some explicit indication.
*** use a tag? <nowiki><span class="p-category">approve</span></nowiki>
*** similarly: <nowiki><span class="p-category">changes</span></nowiki> for request changes
*** or a custom rating field per [[h-review]]?
*** or ... ?

Next steps:
* figure out some markup (perhaps gather at least one more silo example for which the markup would make sense)
* experiment with a manual pull request review on an indieweb site
* experiment with manually POSSEing it to GitHub
* file an issue on [[Bridgy]] Publish to support POSSEing [[h-review]] posts of GitHub pull request URLs. Or perhaps allow minimum viable [[comment]] + special-tags for Bridgy to detect. Or encourage / allow both? (why? why not just use the minimum makrup that would work?)
