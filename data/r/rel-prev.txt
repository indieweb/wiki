{{stub}}

'''<dfn>rel-prev</dfn>''' is the use of the HTML rel attribute on a hyperlink to the page previous to the current page with the value of "prev" to provide a way for consuming code to discover that link and navigate to it to show content previous to the current page; like a monthly [[archive]] page linking to the previous month, or a link from a [[homepage]] with a stream to an archive page of previous posts in the stream.

Note: You might also encounter rel="previous", this should still be supported by consumers for compatibility purposes. ([[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-prev WHATWG HTML5])
