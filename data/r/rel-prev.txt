'''<dfn>rel-previous</dfn>''' is the use of the HTML rel attribute on a hyperlink to the page previous to the current page with the value of "prev" or "previous" to provide a way for consuming code to discover that link and navigate to it to show content previous to the current page; like a monthly [[archive]] page linking to the previous month, or a link from a [[homepage]] with a stream to an archive page of previous posts in the stream.
