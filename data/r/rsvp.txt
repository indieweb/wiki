[[Category:PostType]]

An '''<dfn>RSVP</dfn>''' is a [[reply]] to an [[event]] post that says whether the sender is or is not attending, might attend, or is just interested in the event.

* See '''[[rsvps]]''' for how to and examples of displaying RSVPs received on your events from other sites!

__TOC__
== Why ==
Why implement RSVP posts?

'''Own your RSVPs!''' Itâ€™s empowering being able to RSVP (especially '''yes''' or '''maybe''') from your own site to the indie [[event]] posts, and via [[Bridgy]] Publish to Facebook events as well!

'''Share your RSVPs with friends.''' For public events that you'd like your friends to attend, post RSVPs publicly on your own site. When your friends see that you're going or might go, it helps encourage them to also attend.

'''Encourage friends to go even if you cannot.''' Why implement and post a RSVP '''no'''? A public RSVP '''no''' is a good way to share and promote an event you wish you could go to but can't make it to. 

'''Why POSSE RSVPs?''' Because the sharing / encouraging aspect of publishing makes sense beyond the simple RSVP answers, it also makes sense to [[POSSE]] all your RSVPs as you would any other reply or [[note]] (e.g. to [[Twitter]] etc.) beyond just responding to the event.

== How to ==
How-tos for RSVP posts are very similar to the how-tos for [[reply]] posts so we won't duplicate common info here.

=== How to publish ===
How to <span id="Publish_an_RSVP">publish an RSVP</span>:

Use a tool that supports RSVP posts! E.g. 
==== How to RSVP with Known ====
If you use '''[[Known]]''': 

As of the 0.99 release, Known includes an "Events" plugin by default. Once signed into your Known site, you may activate the Events plugin under the "Site Configuration" menu. Navigate to Plugins, scroll down to find the Events plugin, and click to enable the plugin.

Once enabled, the action bar at top of the content area of your Known website should include an icon entitled "RSVP." Click the icon, and follow the instructions to send an RSVP. Once the RSVP post is created, Known will automatically send a [[Webmention]] to the supplied website address.

==== How to RSVP with WordPress ====
Once you've got [[webmention]] functionality set up in [[Getting Started on WordPress#Webmentions|WordPress]], there are several ways to RSVP to events using [[WordPress]]:
* Use the "RSVP" javascript bookmarklet in the [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this IndieWeb PressThis bookmarklet] (Once installed and activated, the bookmarklets can be found in the admin menu under "Tools"). Go to the page you want to RSVP to and click the bookmarklet in your browser to create an RSVP post.
* Use the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] which includes RSVP functionality.
** Set the Post Kind as RSVP, add the URL and Title of Event into the Post Properties box, and set the RSVP Property.
* Create a traditional post and use [[rsvp#How_to_RSVP_with_HTML|HTML as described below]].

==== How to RSVP with HTML ====
Or if you're using another tool (like your own [[CMS]]) then: 

'''1.''' Create a [[reply]] post and use the [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#p-rsvp h-entry <code>p-rsvp</code> property] to specify your RSVP status. Here's a minimal RSVP post example:
<pre>
&lt;div class="h-entry"&gt;
  &lt;a class="p-author h-card" href="HTTP://YOURSITE.EXAMPLE.ORG/"&gt;
    &lt;img src="HTTP://EXAMPLE.ORG/YOURPHOTO.JPG" alt=""/&gt;
      YOUR FULL NAME HERE&lt;/a&gt;:
 RSVP &lt;span class="p-rsvp"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt; 
 to &lt;a href="HTTP://EXAMPLE.ORG/EVENTURL" class="u-in-reply-to"&gt;INDIEWEB EVENT&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
Replace the ALLCAPS URLs and LINK TEXT with info for you (your site, photo, name), and the event (event link, name).

Note: If your theme already adds the <code>h-entry</code> class, then you will need to leave out the wrapper <code>&lt;div class="h-entry"&gt;</code> tag, and the <code>"p-author h-card"</code> if your theme already includes authorship information.

See example as a whole page: http://codepen.io/iamjessklein/pen/rLXwOw

Possible RSVP values: <samp>yes</samp>, <samp>no</samp>,  <samp>maybe</samp>, <samp>interested</samp>

'''2.''' Send a [[Webmention]] to the event post as you would for a reply to any post. ([https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/30/11/your-first-webmention Sending your First Webmention from Scratch] by {{aaronpk}} is a good tutorial for those doing this for the first time without using other software.)

'''3.''' You should include author information in your RSVP post so the event knows who is attending (and then send another Webmention so the event page gets the update).

See [[reply#Make_a_comment]] for more general details on posting replies.

You can also use the <code>data</code> element to express the meaning behind the literal p-rsvp value while providing your own visible human readable language:
* <code>&lt;data class="p-rsvp" value="yes">I'll be there!&lt;/data></code>

==== Multi RSVP ====
If there are multiple copies of a single event (e.g. [[POSSE]] copies, or [[reposts]]), or multiple sessions for an event, you can post a multi-RSVP, a single RSVP post that replies simultaneously to multiple event URLs.

Publish a multi-RSVP just as it says above, and add [[in-reply-to]] markup for each of the events, similar to how a [[multi-reply]] does so to multiple posts.

The difference is:
* A '''multi-RSVP''' must link to multiple event posts only when they all represent the '''same real world event''', or multiple sessions for the same event, e.g. a multi-day event with different URLs for each day.
* A plain '''multi-reply''' may be replying to '''multiple different posts''', that just happened to be '''related by topic or thread'''.

NEEDED: (a complete multi-RSVP markup example would be nice too)

=== Update an RSVP ===
Similarly, update your RSVP and send another webmention.

See [[reply#Update_a_comment]] for more general details on updating replies.

=== Delete an RSVP ===
Similarly, delete your RSVP, send another webmention, and be prepared to return 410 GONE for your RSVP permalink.

See [[reply#Delete_a_comment]] for more general details on deleting replies.

=== Accept an RSVP ===
RSVPs are sent to [[event]] posts, which should recognize that this type of response is a special RSVP response, and can use that to increment attending/not attending counters for example.

When you receive a webmention from a URL that is a [[reply]] (has an <code>in-reply-to</code> URL that is the event URL), also check if the entry contains an <code>rsvp</code> property.

== Brainstorming ==
=== RSVP buttons ===
An RSVP post starts with some UI to create it, typically in the context of a specific event.

==== RSVP Interested Going ====
A [[reader]] could recognize a public event post, and present buttons for the user to RSVP (e.g. via [[micropub]] with their own site).

Good start with minimal likely options:

<pre>[ Interested ] [ Going ]</pre>

Clicking either button would publish the respective [[RSVP]] to the user's site via micropub, and at a minimum could then:
* Show confirmation: replace the buttons with static UI text that says <pre>âœ“ Interested</pre> or <pre>âœ“ Going</pre> depending on whichever the user chose. This state would not be stored anywhere except the current state of the browser.

==== RSVP simple updates ====
A reader that implemented the above <samp>[ Interested ] [ Going ]</samp> buttons could add just a tiny bit of browser-only code that allowed for undo and updates, as follows:

Start with minimal likely options again:

<pre>[ Interested ] [ Going ]</pre>

But this time, if the user clicks a button, <em>only</em> that button turns into static text, e.g.:

If the user clicks Interested:
<pre>âœ“ Interested  [ Going ]</pre>

If the user clicks Going:
<pre>[ Interested ] âœ“ Going</pre>

If the user clicks on the static text with checkmark âœ“, then delete the RSVP and show:

<pre>[ Interested ] [ Going ]</pre>

Similarly, if the user clicks on another button after clicking one, then update the RSVP accordingly and switch the display to that button being static checkmark UI text.

==== RSVP buttons with state ====
If a reader can keep track of the posts it has made on behalf of the user (keep a cache of the user's RSVP post permalink), then it could update the buttons accordingly (instead of just showing static UI text).

If they chose "Interested", show a button drop down <pre>[ âœ“ Interested v ]</pre> which when clicked shows:
<pre>
[   Going          ]
[ âœ“ Interested     ]
[ --------------   ]
[   Not Interested ]
</pre>

If they chose "Going", show a button drop down <pre>[ âœ“ Going v ]</pre> which when clicked 
<pre>
[ âœ“ Going     ]
[   Maybe     ]
[ ----------  ]
[   Not Going ]
</pre>

And if they click any of those, the show Going as above, and:

If they chose "Not Interested", delete the RSVP post and show (like before)
<pre>[ Interested ] [ Going ]</pre>

If they chose "Maybe", show a button drop down <pre>[ âœ“ Maybe v ]</pre> which when clicked 
<pre>
[   Going     ]
[ âœ“ Maybe     ]
[ ----------  ]
[   Not Going ]
</pre>

If they chose "Not Going", update the RSVP post and show a button drop down <pre>[ âœ“ Not Going v ]</pre> which when clicked 
<pre>
[   Going     ]
[   Maybe     ]
[ ----------  ]
[ âœ“ Not Going ]
</pre>
And again, when selected, update the RSVP post and show the updated button/dropdown.

==== RSVP Going Maybe Cannot ====
For private events and [[invitation]]s, a reader could instead display: 
<pre>[ Going ] [ Maybe ] [ Can't Go ]</pre>

Invitations to a private event typically have an expectation (from the host) of a stronger indication of intent of the invitee.  If you receive an explicit invite to a private event, it's more likely that the host wants an actual yes/no response vs a silent ignore.

Some more reasoning (why the other options are less necessary for private events)
* "interested" is there to be able to let others know of your potential interest in the event, but makes less sense on a private event since a private event doesn't need the "boost" of promoting it to a larger network.
* "ignore". More likely to need the "ignore" button for public events since it's a lot easier to be "invited" to those because of the way Facebook encourages sharing events.

=== Text Design ===
Similar to [[like]] brainstorming, it's useful to explore how to best represent RSVP posts as a '''notification''' (e.g. to the author of the [[event]] (and the [[invitation]]) that the RSVP is responding to), '''text only''' (e.g. SMS authoring/output or POSSEing to text only destinations), '''inline hypertext''' and markup for that.

(stub)

E.g. some p-rsvp value/prose equivalent possibilities to consider, as the start of a plain text [[reply]]
* '''yes''' - "going to " (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs).
** "attending " for an RSVP published during the event. (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs, {{t}} research: 2 of 3 past uses (once a year 2010-2012) of "attending â€¦" in notes were RSVPs, and third was an implied RSVP).
** "went to " for an RSVP published after the event's end time or has otherwise ended. (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs)
** "hosting " for an RSVP to an event that you're actually hosting (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs)
** "co-organizing " for an RSVP to an event that you're co-organizing, but perhaps not hosting (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs)
** more possible variants: "co-hosting", "organizing"
** "signed up for " for an RSVP to an event that includes some form of active partipation (e.g. a trail race) (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs).
* '''maybe''' - "might go to " (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs).
* '''no''' - "not going to " (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs).
** "missing " - as an alias of "not going to " that reflects more of an implied desire to have gone. (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs).
*** non-explicit-RSVP real-world example of "missing " at start of a [[note]] that does reflect this semantic: http://tantek.com/2015/255/t1/celebrate-ariel-matt-tonight (only example found of that text pattern match on his site)
* '''interested''' - "considering tonight's ", "considering today's ", and "considering going to ", all of which provide enough specific context to imply an event (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs)
** non-explicit-RSVP real-world example of "insterested " at start of a [[note]] that does reflect this semantic: http://tantek.com/2011/040/t4/long-now-live-longer-think-who-going (only example found of "considering " text pattern match on his site that applies to an event)
** Rejected: "interested in " - seems too generic, never felt like using it in practice

Remote variants? Only for some level of actual participation (yes, maybe).
* '''yes''' - "remotely attending "
* '''maybe''' - "might remotely attend " (implemented in [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs).

=== Remote Participation ===
If an event has a remote-participation option (no idea how to represent that other than prose), then it makes sense to allow people to RSVP as a remote participant.

This is useful for at least two reasons (use-cases), a remote RSVP ...
* helps the event organizer plan for making sure the remote-participation setup is working
* implies the organizer need not worry about any food/drink/seating in-person for that RSVP

Real world examples:
* [[#Tantek]]'s RSVPs for a couple of real world examples of prose publishing of remote RSVPs.
* [[#Doug_Beal]]'s RSVPs for yes (remote) example

Driving use-case:
* Tantek's [[event]]: http://tantek.com/2018/212/e1/indiewebcamp-sf-dweb-hackers-day
** needs estimate for food, thus needs to know who is RSVPing in-person (default) vs. remote (explicit)

Possible approaches:
* new property (seems heavy-weight)
* new RSVP property value, e.g.
** "yes-remote" - would likely require everyone (including English publishers) to use <code>data</code> element, perhaps a good thing to encourage cross-language consistency in markup?
* expand RSVP property grammar, space separated set of values like class/rel, add "remote"
** e.g. "yes remote" (or "remote yes", equivalent)
** also "maybe remote" (not sure if anyone has published this yet)

==== What value could be used to? ====
It is necessary to differentiate <code>yes</code> between remote and onsite, especially considering the second reason given above. Someone participating remotely will not be taking a seat and may not always count towards the total of guests allowed.

Would it be useful to extend [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#p-rsvp the possible values] from <code>yes</code>, <code>no</code>, <code>maybe</code>, <code>interested</code> to <code>yes</code>, <code>no</code>, <code>maybe</code>, <code>interested</code>, <code>remote yes</code>, <code>remote no</code>, <code>remote maybe</code>, <code>remote interested</code>?

* with these double values, does the order matter? Should consumers pickup <code>yes remote</code> too? This makes consuming harder.
** how hard would it be to define RSVP as a [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#unordered-set-of-unique-space-separated-tokens set of space separated values], much like <code>rel</code>-attribute values? In CSS selector terms <code>[value~="remote"]</code> would tell a consumer that the RSVP is remote. â€”{{martijnvdven}}
* {{sebsel}}: <code>remote no</code> does not need it's own value, for <code>no</code> is 'no'. I'm not sure about <code>remote maybe</code> and <code>remote interested</code>, but if it turns out you don't need them, just <code>remote</code> (and implying 'remote yes') might be just enough.
** -0 on remote no. If an event explicitly allows / encourages remote participation, a <code>remote no</code> could make sense as an update to a <code>remote yes</code> or <code>remote interested</code> previous RSVP, though it's not clear that just plain <code>no</code> wouldn't work, or rather, what additional meaning / usefulness does remote no provide over no? I'd lean toward minimizing possible values to those that have actual necessary use-cases not covered by existing values. - <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|http://tantek.com/logo.jpg}} [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Ã‡elik]]</span> 13:59, 2 May 2018 (PDT)
* dash instead of space? remote participation is so different than in-person participation that it may make sense to use explicit new dash separated values for them like: <code>remote-yes</code> and <code>remote-maybe</code> ({{t}} has used remote maybe in prose) indicating actual intent or possibility of using remote participation tools. It's not clear how <code>remote-interested</code> is any different than interested (neither implies anything about participation), see above for why <code>remote-no</code> is likely unnecessary. - <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|http://tantek.com/logo.jpg}} [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Ã‡elik]]</span> 14:03, 2 May 2018 (PDT)
* {{gwg}} believes remote yes is redundant. For a yes remotely, just remote makes sense. No is no. There may be a case for a maybe or interested version of remote in future, but suggest that remote itself should come first.

===== Examples of brainstorm implementations =====

* {{martijnvdven}} [https://licit.li/5940f76f2f217 published] a <code>remote yes</code> RSVP to [[2017|IWS 2017]].

=== POSSE ===
How and where should RSVP posts be [[POSSE]]d?

Event-aware destinations to consider:

* [[Facebook]] - lots of events are posted on FB
** [[Bridgy]] Publish supports POSSEing RSVPs to Facebook Events!
** '''{{t}}''' is posting RSVPs using [[Falcon]] on tantek.com and automatically POSSEing them to Facebook using Bridgy. See [[#Tantek|examples above]].

* [[Eventbrite]] - has best API for creating events, getting updates, perhaps backfeeding attendees etc.
** [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/484 Bridgy feature request: publish RSVP to an Eventbrite event] (Related: [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/275 Bridgy feature request: publish Eventbrite events])
** Lots of people seem to use Eventbrite to post events
** Eventbrite also emails people when some number (2+?) of their friends are going to an event - so it's a good way to indirectly let your friends know too when you RSVP.
** Real world examples of indie RSVP posts in reply to Eventbrite events:
*** {{t}}: http://tantek.com/2015/266/t1/science-hack-day-san-francisco-sign-up

* [[Lanyrd]] - has an API for creating events, getting updates, backfeeding RSVPs
** No explicit Bridgy Publish issue for POSSEing an indie RSVP to a Lanyrd event as no one has posted one yet.
** Related: [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/390 Bridgy Publish feature request: POSSE to Lanyrd]
** Related: [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/391 Bridgy backfeed from Lanyrd feature request]

* [[Plancast]] - event-specific silo
** No explicit Bridgy Publish issue for POSSEing an indie RSVP to a Plancast event as no one has posted one yet.

Problematic event-aware destinations:
* [[Google+]] - another [[silo]] that has explicit event posts, but has some challenges:
** G+ API doesn't expose events
*** when someone shares an event, you can see it in their stream with activities.list and get, but that's just a note about it, not the event itself. 
*** G+ API bug asking for events: http://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=567
*** Not sure if that would help towards being able to RSVP to a G+ event.

Other destinations:
* [[Twitter]] - can we compress the details of an RSVP post into 140 characters or less? (117 to leave room for event permalink URL, 116 for https).
** Is there an [[event]] POSSE tweet to @-reply to from your RSVP POSSE tweet?
** If not, how do we abbreviate what/when/where "fields"? E.g. just like [[event#POSSE]]:
*** What: summary... (ellipsed)
*** Where: @-alias of venue (how do we do venue lookup on Twitter? Perhaps use [[Foursquare]] to lookup the venue and see if their venue entry has a Twitter for the venue?
*** When: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (seems quite long, what's the best way to compress a datetime in a human readable way?)
*** CC: @-names (of folks to explicitly notify, like an invitation)
*** Should such fields be explicitly labeled e.g. with "What: / Where:" etc. with linebreaks between them?
*** Or should we figure out a plain text event serialization format since things like an @-named venue already reads well "at venue"? (see [http://microformats.org/wiki/picoformats picoformats] for prior work/research on this)
** IndieWeb Examples:
*** https://twitter.com/t/status/646773517065678848 POSSE tweet of [http://tantek.com/2015/266/t1/science-hack-day-san-francisco-sign-up]
** How do we backfeed RSVP-like responses from Twitter? E.g. determine that a response is an RSVP yes/no/maybe:
*** https://twitter.com/Johannes_Ernst/status/1097915214689853440 <blockquote>Planning to be there!</blockquote>

=== Capacity and Ticketing ===
TODO({{kevinmarks}},{{snarfed}}): merge into [[event#How_to_limit_capacity]]

If event capacity is limited, the event host may not know at the time of responding to the RSVP whether you are allowed in (get a ticket) or not (waitlisted).
It can supply a URL to answer this later in the RSVP 202 response. However this protocol could be extended to cover the ticketing case too.
* Return the ticket/waitlist url in the RSVP response.
* when the capacity issue is resolved, update the ticket url information so that the unauthenticated page includes a h-entry that states 'you have 2 tickets' 'you are waitlisted' etc.
* send a webmention back to the RSVP post so that this response shows up OR poll the webmention status URL
* we could define new markup for this stage so it can be automatically handled

Attendees can also RSVP for multiple people, ie request multiple tickets, by posting multiple RSVPs, one per ticket.  CMSes can automate this with custom RSVP UIs that generate and send an RSVP post per ticket.

During the event, there are a couple possible ways for host(s) to verify attendees. If you want to use traditional tickets, when the RSVP poster goes to the ticket link, they can authenticate in with indieauth to get the actual ticket proof, which may be printable, a QR code to display on the phone, or just a page you show to the doorkeeper.

A more modern, IndieWeb way is to forego tickets entirely, digital or otherwise. If the host has followed the process above, they end up with a list of RSVPs and domains for those RSVPs. The host can then set up a page on their site that accepts IndieAuth logins. When an attendee arrives, they IndieAuth into that page with their domain, the host checks the domain against their RSVP list, and lets them in (along with any guests).

=== Calendar integration ===

It could be useful for RSVP 'yes' posts to appear in your calendar.

* {{aaronpk}} publishes an iCal feed of his event posts and then subscribes to this in Google Calendar - the same approach could be used for RSVP posts.

== FAQ ==
=== are rsvp-values case-sensitive? ===
No. Per [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Core_Properties the h-entry specification], the values for p-rsvp are ''Case-insensitive values, normalized to lowercase.'', so <samp>yes</samp>, <samp>Yes</samp> or <samp>yEs</samp> are all valid and equivalent.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has fairly widespread support of RSVP posts and RSVP-specific [[webactions]] on [[event]] posts.

Many details about Facebook's RSVP posts and buttons (including screenshots and wireframes) are captured here:
