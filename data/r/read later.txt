[https://www.rmendes.net/ Rick Mendes] uses hashtags #readlater and #readinglist on his [[Known]] site [https://www.rmendes.net/2016/08/22/blockchain-democracy-government-of-the-people-by-the-people-for 1]. He provides additional details and discussion [https://www.rmendes.net/2016/08/22/chrisaldrich-im-still-experimenting-trying-not-to-multiply-hashtags-too here].

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has been experimenting with general reading posts/workflows, some of which are discussed here: [http://boffosocko.com/2016/08/22/a-new-reading-post-type-for-bookmarking-and-reading-workflow/ A New Reading Post-type for Bookmarking and Reading Workflow]. In December 2016, I began using [[PressForward]] to internally save private [[bookmarks]] for things I want to read later, as well as a way to easily publish them as [[read]] posts when done.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has been experimenting by posting book titles prefixed with "Want to read:" since 2016-04-06
* https://gregorlove.com/2016/04/want-to-read-a-kim/
* Using <code>h-item</code> and <code>u-identifier</code> for the book title. The identifier's href is in the format <code>ISBN:XXXXX</code>.
* Manually [[POSSE]] to [[Goodreads]].
