{{stub}}

'''<dfn>rel-previous</dfn>''' is the use of the HTML rel attribute on a hyperlink to page previous to the current page with the value of "previous" to provide a way for consuming code to discover that link and navigate to it to show content previous to the current page; like an indieweb archive page that links to the previous archive page in a time series.
