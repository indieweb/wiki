{{stub}}
'''<dfn>robots.txt</dfn>''' is a file used to inform web crawlers what parts of a site should or should not be crawled. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt]

Because this file is just a suggestion and bots can choose to ignore it, it's not a guaranteed way of keeping away crawlers. But generally, ones from big search engines will respect it won't publicly index your site if you declare it so.

Example command names:
* [[user-agent|User-agent]]
* [[Disallow]]
* [[Noindex]]
* [[Allow]]
* Crawl-delay
* Sitemap
* Content-signal

== Examples ==
The following examples may be copy pasted into a plain text robots.txt file and placed at the root of your domain.

Brief example to block anything inside a particular top level directory "/wiki/":
<pre>
User-agent: *
Disallow: /wiki/
</pre>

Note that Google seems to ignore the "*" User-agent and must be specifically disallowed:
<pre>
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /wiki/
</pre>

You may want to entirely block some particularly abusive bots:
<pre>
User-agent: AhrefsBot
Disallow: /
</pre>

</pre>

Directive to disallow [[ChatGPT]]: https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot

<pre>
User-agent: ChatGPT-User
