'''<dfn>RSVPs</dfn>''' are the [[responses]] displayed on an [[event]] indicating who is attending or not, might be, or interested in the event.

* See '''[[rsvp]]''' for how to and examples of individual rsvp posts themselves!

== Why ==
By displaying the RSVPs to your event posts, you show who is likely to participate with your event. It also shows immediate feedback to those that have RSVPd to your event with their own indie [[rsvp]] response.

== How to ==

=== How to display ===
There are many methods for displaying the RSVPs for an event.

(need screenshots)

Consider linking from specific RSVP items to the permalinks of the respective indie RSVPs to your event.

If you are showing silo RSVPs of POSSE copies of your event posts, from silos that lack permalinks for such RSVPs posts / responses, then you may link them to the user RSVPing to your event as a fallback.

=== How to de-duplicate ===
Since an RSVP indicates the attendance (or not) of a specific person, multiple RSVPs from the same person should only count as one, the most recent (or most recently updated if newer) RSVP being authoritative.

If you [[POSSE]] an event to a silo, then it is possible that someone posting an indie [[rsvp]] of your post will also POSSE their RSVP to that silo, thus resulting your post seemingly seeing two RSVPs from the same one RSVP from that person. 

Since those RSVPs represent only a single actual individual RSVPing, your post should de-duplicate any such RSVPs of POSSE copies of your events, and show only a single RSVP, no matter what your display design is for RSVPs.

When you detect such duplicate RSVPs on silo copies of your events, you should prefer and show only the indie RSVP on your RSVPs display on your event.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are a few IndieWeb sites which receive and handle [[webmentions]] for [[RSVP]] posts and display them in various ways.

'''TO DO:''' Review [[event#IndieWeb_Examples]] for dates, permalinks, and more examples of receiving/showing RSVPs on event posts, and incorporate/move those details here to this section, keeping the event examples focused on the event posts themselves.

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} uses [[Known]] to display a chronological list of RSVPs of a post, since 20??-??-??. Examples:
* 2013-??-?? IndieWebCamp related? (need permalink)

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] to display a RSVPs on events since 2013-??-??. Example: 
* 2013-??-?? IndieWebCamp related?

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} uses [[Redwind]] to display RSVPs since 20??-??-??. Example:
* 2015-??-?? HWC event? (need permalink)

=== Calum Ryan ===
{{calumryan}} has been officially accepting and displaying RSVPs for people attending Homebrew Website Club London since 2016-12-14. The implementation is a modification of the Jekyll plugin for handling Webmentions. Upon triggering a build of the static webpage there's a custom filter to change the markup with a visible tick or cross depending on whether a Webmention contains the rsvp-no or rsvp-yes value. In his CMS there's a basic dropdown interface also added for RSVP options that triggers sending a Webmention upon posting short-form content with these RSVP yes/no values included.

=== ... need more from event page ===
Need to add more from the [[event]] page of people receiving/showing RSVPs on event posts.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has been showing RSVPs [[facepile]]s on his event posts [http://tantek.com/2017/189/t1/rsvps-display-on-indie-events since 2017-07-06]. 

The [[Falcon]] implementation depends on and uses:
* [[webmention.io]] jf2 output of received rsvp webmentions, sorted by rsvp value
* [[stream.thatmustbe.us]] jf2 to mf2 with a custom inline style sheet
* an iframe to embed the result on event permalinks
Examples (events posted before RSVP display support, but displayed received RSVPs after the fact)
* 2017-06-25 posted http://tantek.com/2017/179/e1/homebrew-website-club
** shows three "no" indie RSVPs 
** (screenshot needed)
* 2017-07-02 posted http://tantek.com/2017/183/e1/sunday-yoga-presidio
** shows a mix of "yes" and "interested" RSVPs [[backfed]] via [[Bridgy]] from the [[Facebook]] POSSE event
** (screenshot needed)
Examples (events which showed RSVPs as they arrived via Webmention)
* 2017-07-10 posted http://tantek.com/2017/193/e1/homebrew-website-club
* 2017-07-15 posted http://tantek.com/2017/197/e1/sunday-yoga-presidio
** both also with "yes" and "interested" RSVPs [[backfed]] from the FB POSSE event

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] shows RSVPs on [[Facebook#Event|their event posts]] and has done so many different ways over the years, thus there is a lot of prior art to choose from and be inspired by.

Design regressions related to RSVPs:
# Global noise in the left column replaces the very relevant and easily skimmable who is going, maybe, invited lists of people
# Less clear who is going/maybe/invited
# Lack of hierarchy (ordering) of going/maybe/invited removes subtle invitee incentive to upgrade from invited to maybe to going.

==== Facebook before 2014-02-07 ====
This was perhaps the pinnacle of Facebook's event page design.

[[Facebook]] has had one of the more interesting/nicer/cleaner event page designs for quite some time.

Here is a screenshot of the [[events/2014-02-12-homebrew-website-club|2014-02-12 Homebrew Website Club]] event (for the SF location) on Facebook, manually POSSEd by [[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] from http://werd.io/2014/homebrew-website-club-meeting :

== Meetup.com ==
[http://meetup.com Meetup.com] is an [[event]] silo for creating and/or finding small gatherings in your local community who share your interests

RSVPs displayed on an event page. Clicking on the "Show more" link takes one to a standalone page (pictured below) which allows viewing of both attendees and those who have indicated they're not attending.

Standalone RSVP page example:

=== Sched ===
[[Sched]] is an [[event]] specific [[silo]] that provides some interesting event related UI as well

The service provides the ability to display [[RSVP|RSVPs]] as a [[facepile]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== Going and Interested ===
Note in the [[#Facebook_2017|Facebook 2017]] example above the text just above the RSVPs facepile:
<blockquote>2 Going â€¢ 5 Interested</blockquote>
