https://indieweb.org/reader

A '''<dfn>reader</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>indie reader</dfn> or <dfn>social reader</dfn>) in the context of the indieweb is the portion/feature integrated into an indieweb site that provides a way to read content from other indieweb sites, possibly including posts from the current site, and [[response|respond]] ([[like]], [[comment]], [[repost]], etc) inline in the reading UI itself. 

If youâ€™re looking for pre-indieweb / one-way read-only feed readers (e.g. like Google Reader) see:
* [[feed reader]]

== Social Readers ==
The latest exciting development in readers is easy to set-up interactive '''<dfn>Social Readers</dfn>''' built on top of the emerging [[Microsub]] standard that builds on the openness of yesterdayâ€™s feed readers, modernized with interactivity everyone now expects from [[social media]].

=== Indigenous ===
[[Indigenous|<img src="https://indieweb.org/images/2/2a/indigenous-0.3-reader.png" style="max-width:25%;float:left" alt="iOS Indigenous screenshot." /><img src="https://realize.be/indigenous-screenshots/indigenous_channel_list.jpg" style="max-width:25%;float:left"><div style="clear:left">&nbsp;</div>]]

{{eddiehinkle.com}} and {{realize.be}} are working on [[Indigenous]], which are native iOS and Android reader apps. It is based on [[Microsub]] and [[Micropub]]. It allows a user to login using IndieAuth, and if a [[Microsub]] endpoint is found on the user's primary identity site, a reader interface is shown when the app is opened. It includes the following features:
* See a list of channels
* Preview all posts in a channel, with the option to send a [[reply]] via [[Micropub]] or view the original post at the permalink.

=== Monocle ===
[[Monocle|<img src="https://indieweb.org/images/5/53/monocle-timeline-view.png" style="max-width:50%;float:left" alt="Monocle desktop screenshot of timeline view." /><div style="clear:left">&nbsp;</div>]]
[[Monocle]] is a reader that is a generic [[Microsub]] client and can be used with any [[Microsub]] server, written by {{aaronpk}}.

=== Together Project ===
{{grantcodes}} and {{cleverdevil}} are working on the [[Together]] project, which is an open source reader based upon [[Microsub]] and [[Micropub]]. Together attempts to provide an integrated experience that "brings your IndieWeb experience together," including:
* Preview and subscribe to websites, arranging them into "channels."
* Create interactions including Like, Repost, and Reply, publishing those interactions to your website via [[Micropub]].
* Different layouts to view posts as a timeline, gallery, map or classic 2 pane reader.

Here are a few screenshots of Together as of November 20th, 2018:

== Why ==
Reasons to have a personal reader (a reader integrated into your site for you to use)
* If you had reading built into your own site, would you ever need to visit [[Twitter]] or touch a Twitter client again? (since you can presumably already post from your site and [[POSSE]] to Twitter, including [[replies]])
* Your own site can provide you with a superset of Twitter-like functionality, assuming you're already
** posting [[notes]],
** POSSEing them to Twitter, 
** [[backfeed]]ing replies/favorites/retweets onto your original notes (e.g. using [[Bridgy]]).
** Add to that:
*** following others
*** reading others' notes
*** inline favoriting, retweeting, and replying to others' notes
* Filter and prioritize posts from others using algorithms of your own choosing.
That's just the beginnings of what an indieweb reader can enable.


== IndieWeb Examples ==

Note: 2018-11-19 some of these may be out of date, need to review them to see which are still active and move others to a former examples subsection.

=== Ashton McAllan ===

{{acegiak}} developed a [[Wordpress]] plugin, '''[[WhisperFollow]]''', which aggregates RSS/Atom and Microformats2 data from the pages linked to in your blogroll and displays those updates in a private page in your wordpress blog. It currently defaults to RSS/Atom only attempting to read MF2 if the separate feed isn't found. It also allows updates to be reblogged, replied to, favourited, and commented on etc.

=== Barnaby Walters ===

[[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] developed '''Intertubes''', an experimental indieweb-oriented flow-based programming + feed reader UI parsing microformats and shimmed twitter.com microformats.

=== Kyle Mahan ===

{{kylewm}} is developing [[Woodwind]], a simple reader in Python/Flask, with an instance running at [http://reader.kylewm.com] since [https://kylewm.com/2015/02/liking-a-post-via-woodwind-1 2015-02-01]. It includes:

* Sign up/login via indieauth, open to anyone.
* Supports h-feed via [[mf2util]] and XML feeds via Python's excellent feedparser.
* Support different strategies for posting responses -- micropub, indie-config, and custom URL endpoints.

=== Aaron Parecki ===

{{aaronpk}} is developing [[Monocle]], a simple reader in PHP built as part of [[p3k]], and is running it at https://monocle.p3k.io since 2015-03-16. It includes:

* Sign up/login via IndieAuth, open to anyone
* Supports subscribing to [[h-feed]] URLs
* Supports posting "likes" and "bookmarks" back to your site
* Subscribes to [[PuSH]] hubs of URLs that are added

=== Malcolm Blaney ===
{{mblaney}} has added microformats support to the [[SimplePie]] feed parsing library, which is available at https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie. This library is used in conjunction with [[dobrado]] to provide an easy to use reader.  It is deployed at https://unicyclic.com and includes:

* Sign up/login open to anyone via traditional username/password with email confirmation.
* Login is also publicly available via [[IndieAuth]], and posts created via [[Micropub]] in this case.
* When IndieAuth is used but Micropub is not available, [[indie-config]] is used for actions.
* Supports displaying previous actions made by using the indie-config status protocol.
* Supports multi-feed discovery via link tags or rel=feed. 
* Supports subscribing to any page containing h-feeds or h-entry's (as well as xml feeds).
* Supports in-line posting, likes, shares and replies.
* Update notifications from both [[PubSubHubbub]] and [[rssCloud]].
* Imports a list of feeds (OPML) from many other readers including: Google Reader, Feedly, Newsblur, inoreader.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} installed the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressforward/ WordPress plugin] for [[PressForward]] to create an integrated feed reader into his [[WordPress]] site. While IndieWeb in flavor it could still stand to add a few pieces of additonal functionality. In conjunction with the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds plugin], the two together allow for a more coherent self-contained workflow. Features include:
* The ability to privately [[bookmark]] posts (PressForward calls this functionality "nominate")
* Easily reposting stories (including the full contents, photos, etc) or posting them as [[read]], [[bookmark]], like, favorite, etc. posts (one could also mark them as read privately).
** Canonical URL use allows for the option of redirecting posts to the original story to properly attribute credit to the originating site
* A bookmarklet for easily adding individual stories and or saving sources for subscribing to at a later date.
* An integrated clean reading interface courtesy of [[Mercury]] (fka [[Readability]]).
* The ability to save a full [[archival copy]] of the posts within the reader.

=== Yarns Indie Reader ===
[[Yarns]] is a [[reader]] that is built for use with [[WordPress]] as a plugin. It supports [[microformats]] and [[micropub]]. Built by [[User:Jackjamieson.net|Jack Jamieson]] and announced on his site on [http://jackjamieson.net/yarns-indie-reader/ 2018-02-08]. It's based in part on {{acegiak}}'s [[WhisperFollow]] with inspiration by [[Woodwind]]. Development and distribution of the project is done on [https://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-indie-reader Github].

=== Previous Examples ===

==== Aaron Parecki selfoss ====
[[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] developed a [https://github.com/aaronpk/selfoss Microformats2 plugin for '''selfoss'''], and ran it on a subdomain of aaronparecki.com around [https://aaronparecki.com/2014/02/13/13/microformats-selfoss-indieweb 2014-02-13]. The reader polls the subscriptions at a predefined interval looking for new h-entry posts on each person's home page.

Here's a screenshot of a following list:

== Software Examples ==
=== Woodwind ===

[[Woodwind]] is an open source social reader that supports subscribing to [[h-feed]] and [[XML]] feeds, as well as [[IndieAuth]] and [[Micropub]].


== Brainstorming ==
=== Integrated Activity Reading ===
From analyzing the screenshots in this article:
* http://dcurt.is/facebooks-predicament
of [[Facebook]]'s News Feed experiment:

https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/gpnggaky8d1gog_small.jpg

A single integrated news feed of friends' activities, including posts and likes.

Comparing the experiment and the reversion, shows the experiment provided:
* More efficient reading (less time spent by the user reading the news feed) <blockquote>...users who were switched to the new News Feed tended to spend less time on the site.</blockquote>
* Less distraction (less frequent browsing of other pages) <blockquote>...users no longer felt the need to browse areas outside of the News Feed as often...</blockquote>
* Fewer UI elements overall (including fewer navigation links, especially with activity numbers on those other pages).

All of these differences provided for a better-for-the-user user experience (faster, more focused, more relaxed) which could (should) be used in the design of indieweb reader user interfaces, as it provides opportunities to outdo silo UX.

=== Jeena Notes Reader ===
Thoughts on challenges and how to develop an indie notes reader:
* https://jeena.net/indie-notes-reader

=== Dark Matter Reader ===

I ({{veganstraightedge}}) have "plans" to build a personal reader, as a separate project, called [http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Reader Dark Matter Reader].
I made a static prototype in 2010-08 (with static snapshots of real data from then).

The ''plan'' is for '''[http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Reader Dark Matter Reader]''' and [http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Publisher Dark Matter Publisher] to be sister projects.
Subscribe [[webactions]] (while browsing around the web) will get caught by '''[http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Reader Dark Matter Reader]'''.
Repost/Reply/Bookmark [[webactions]] will go from my '''[http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Reader Dark Matter Reader]''' app to my [http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Publisher Dark Matter Publisher] powered site.
But both will be optional connections to the other. Either '''[http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Reader Dark Matter Reader]''' or [http://indiewebcamp.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter_Publisher Dark Matter Publisher] could be run stand-alone without the other one. At least, that's the Big Planâ„¢. (Not enough time/money/people.) -{{veganstraightedge}} (2013-08-10)

===Partial Feeds===
See: [[h-feed#partial_feeds]]

===Discovery of posts on a page===
Given a URL, a reader needs to be able to reliably find the list of entries on the page.

===Discovery of alternate feeds===
<span id="Autodiscovery_of_h-feeds"></span>
See also: [[h-feed#canonical_feed_autodiscovery]]

Given someone's home page, they may link to one or more additional feeds of posts other than what's visible on the home page.

===List and hashtag===
In 2015, at the [[XOXO]] festival, {{aaronpk}} created a private stream of tweets from attendees who mentioned "xoxo," and those tweets appeared in the conference's [[Slack]] channel. This was hugely popular at the conference since the hashtag on Twitter was being spammed, making it impossible to read actual content about the conference on Twitter itself.

=== In-stream comments and likes ===

As discussed on IRC [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-10-05#t1444089880448]

I enjoy the integrated experience of an indie reader, but am missing comments and likes from others. This is especially noticeable when I want to comment on something and then realize someone may have made the same comment, a better comment, or a comment that makes my comment seem silly.

A "(n) comments" indicator would be a nice alternative/addition.

Technical challenges:
* We don't want to poll every permalink ever seen forever
* How to get timely updates?
* Silo feeds proxied through granary: how to fetch proxy permalinks and not the real permalinks?

Ideas:
* Poll/refresh only when the item is clicked or asynchronous fetch when the item is viewed with live updates

=== Post Presentation ===

How should a reader display a post -- should it try to include the whole thing, or just an excerpt or summary?

[[Woodwind]] includes an optional title ("name") followed by the "content" or "summary" if content is not provided.
* In general Woodwind tries to show the full content of a post (which can be overwhelming), but because it only fetches the feed page, and not the individual permalinks, it only has access to the infomation in the feed.
* On h-entry posts (as opposed to h-event), if there is a "name" but no "content" or "summary", the name is displayed as if it were content. In my experience, these posts tend to be note-length posts marked up with only p-name.
* [[File:woodwind-presentation-2016-04-22.png|400px]]

=== Inclusion of non-Indieweb sources ===
Considering that a user's interest is likely not limited to content published on Indieweb-enabled sites, an important feature of a reader app could also be the ability to subscribe other sources, such as RSS feeds or even silo feeds (by means of an API, if available).

As of December 2017 {{sgreger}} is investigating an approach where incoming links from Indieweb feeds, RSS feeds and links posted by Twitter contacts merge into one reader UI - from where these can then be opened, bookmarked, published etc.

=== Incremental development path ===
{{t}}: I'd like to figure out an incremental development path from including integrated [[reply-context]]s in posts on my site to ... an integrated reader on my site.

My sense is that there are useful steps along the way, each of which is both not too hard to implement, and provides actual user benefit when built.

I'm not saying there shouldn't be separate / standalone reader UIs like [[Woodwind]] and [[Monocle]], rather that that represents existing (pre-social-media) models / apps, and that a compelling UX (as compared to [[social media]]) for [[generations]] 2-4 will require integrated /reader UX.

I'm working on this in two ways:
# [[Falcon#improve_replies_details]] has reply-context improvements I need to build
# Documenting emergent incremental steps in [[IndieMark#aggregation]] - based on what "reader-like" building blocks people are already building, deploying, using integrated on their own websites.

I'm assuming for now that I'm missing key pieces of or underestimating the scope of this challenge, and in particular missing some key difficult building blocks required by an integrated reader. I hope that documenting my thinking and coding as I go will both reveal some of these, and perhaps more importantly, help the community as a whole figure out what some of these missing building blocks may be.

== Challenges ==
=== overload ===
As Twitter, Tumblr, and other aggregators have demonstrated, keeping up with everything you've subscribed to is both challenging, and eventually unrewarding.  Thus some amount of smart filtering/pruning/batching is likely to be an essential part of making indie readers scale beyond following only a handful of people. See also:
* http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/2013-the-year-the-stream-crested/282202/

one of the reasons I'm not building algorithmic filtering into whisperfollow at the moment is to avoid the filter bubble effect: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ofWFx525s] - [[User:acegiak.machinespirit.net|acegiak]] (2013-08-10)

=== distraction ===
Whoever is working on the indie reader problem, please consider the problem of social media distraction (which seems to come more from the reading side than the writing side). See related: [[silo-quits]].

=== missing good stuff ===
Likely as an attempt to compensate for [[#overload]] as noted above, users tend to limit the number of sources they follow, thus resulting in another challenge - the loss of signal, AKA "missing good stuff".

It is possible that there are some approaches for mitigating overload (e.g. perhaps categorizing notes with non-self-source links as comments on those links, and aggregating them by link destination) that could help bubble up "good stuff" from a larger set of people you follow.

=== outdo search ===
<blockquote>One of the reasons I have not prioritized the reader for myself, because I have better luck reading social media by searching for hashtags (results piped to IRC) and having other people send me things :)</blockquote> - [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaronpk]] in [[IRC]].

=== Subscription Maintenance === 
It becomes more and more time consuming to maintain a large list of subscriptions in traditional feed readers.  It isn't uncommon to see feed URLs go dark, change location or just stop working for whatever reason.  It would be advantageous for the next crop of readers to provide tools to help automate this sort of maintenance.  It would also be great to find ways for feeds to state "This will never be updated again" and "This feed will be moving to this new location".

== Open source examples ==
* Status.net - allows you to subscribe to any [[PuSH]]-enabled feed on the web and view it on your [[home page]].

== Silo examples ==
Many social content hosting [[silos]] have integrated reader like features, but only for "feeds" of accounts on the particular silo.
* [[Facebook]] - logged in home page has a "news feed" that essentially provides feed reader like functionality of the [[activities]] (including posts) of friends of the logged in account.
** Issues: some sites have successfully gamed the Facebook news feed to dominate, e.g. Upworthy: <br/> [https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/429732451741872128 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BfawXsMCIAAqSrW.png]
* [[Tumblr]] - logged in dashboard has a feed reader of Tumblr users followed by the logged in account
* [[Twitter]] - logged in home page is a feed reader of Twitter users followed by the logged in account

== Next Steps ==
After implementing an indie reader, you may find that you want to search all the things you read. See:
* [[search#Social_search|search: Social Search]] for some brainstorming on this.
