{{stub}}
'''<dfn>reacjis</dfn>''' are a collection of [[reacji]] posts displayed on a web page, usually after an article, reply, or other piece of content on a website. reacjis may be accompanied by a count of reacjis.

For example:

[[File:slack many reactions.png]]

The row(s) of buttons with icons at the bottom indicate the reacji that the post has received, with the numbers inside them showing the counts of how many of each reacji has been received.


For individual reacji posts and guidance on how to markup a reacji permalink, see:
* '''[[reacji]]'''

== Why ==
Why should you support receiving reacjis and displaying them? 

So people can send you reacjis and have it show up!

E.g. a üéÇ for your birthday, or different kinds of reactions instead of just a "[[like]]".

== How to ==
=== How to receive and display reacjis ===
You can detect a reacji reply post by inspecting any incoming reply to see if it is a single emoji character.  
This is harder than it seems as there are many possible emoji sets and some emoji can consist of multiple characters combined.  Just looking for the single character emoji will cover most emoji however. 

* Be sure to remove whitespace as there may be some extra at the beginning or end unintentionally
* [[brid.gy]] backfeeds twitter replies with the @username at the front, you may want to strip this
* You may want to strip HTML tags to make sure they don't prevent you recognizing an emoji

Once you have detected the reacji and what emoji it is, display it as a reaction like you display [[likes]], followed by the count next to it or stamped on it like in the Slack example above.


== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of receiving and displaying reacjis:

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} displays reacji in [[Postly]] [https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2015/12/8/2/ since 2015-12-08] (his birthday, send him a üéÇ) https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2015/12/8/2/

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} displays received reacjis in a [[facepile]] [https://seblog.nl/2017/03/12/6/day-45-receiving-reacji since 2017-03-12].

== Silo Examples ==
Besides Slack, individuals have started to post reacjis on other silos.

=== Slack ===

=== Discord ===

Discord allows you to post reacjis on any message.

Here is how Discord displays a reacji on a message:

[[File:discord reacji display.png]]

To add a reacji to a post, one must click the "Add reaction" button that appears when you hover over a message. Then, one can select a reactji to post on a message.

Here is the reacji selection interface on Discord:

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has reacji ([[Path]]-style, as a small set of emoji-like graphics) as an extension of "[[like|Like]]" and calls them [[reactions]]. Supported since 2016-02-24 on posts, and since 2017-05-03 on comments. emoji and text (on hover) equivalents:
* üëç like
* ‚ù§Ô∏è love
* üå∏ (purple) flower - temporary [http://time.com/4322307/facebook-flower-reaction-mothers-day/ Time 2016], [https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/13/15635974/mothers-day-thankful-facebook-camera-flower-reaction-instagram The Verge 2017]
* üåà rainbow (flag) - temporary [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/06/12/get-pride-rainbow-flag-reaction-facebook/ Telegraph 2017], [https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/facebook-s-rainbow-pride-emoji-coming-back-kind-n780716 NBC 2017]
* üòÜ haha

2017-05-03 New feature prompt to "React to a [[comment|Comment]]":

[[File:2017-05-03-fb-new-react-to-comment.png]]

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] also supports a small set of reacji in response to pull requests, issues, and comments (and calls them [[reactions]]), [https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments since 2016-03-10]:
* üëç +1
* üëé -1
* üòÜ Laugh
* üéâ Hooray
* üòï Confused
* ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart
* üöÄ Rocket
* üëÄ Eyes

You can [https://brid.gy/about#github-reaction POSSE these to GitHub using Bridgy Publish].

=== Path ===
[[Path]] has had limited reacji, as a small set of emoji-like graphics, since (??? their launch) years ago, and was likely the first silo to do so.

(need screenshot)

=== Basecamp ===
[[Basecamp]] replaces their previous ‚Äúlike‚Äù functionality with ‚Äúboosts‚Äù which aim to merge reacji with short text reactions and avoids counts. They also only show the boosts to the author, not to others.
[This article https://m.signalvnoise.com/introducing-boosts-an-all-new-way-to-show-your-support-in-basecamp-fae325634998] should probably be analyzed more and summarized best practices and indieweb relevant pieces entered in here.

(Need screenshot)

== Implementations ==
=== Libraries ===
"single emoji" detection:
* {{benthatmustbeme}} made a PHP library for determining if a string is a "single emoji" (a harder problem than it seems) available at https://github.com/dissolve/single-emoji-recognizer ([[selfdogfood]]ing on his own site)
* {{t}} wrote a ~25 line PHP function with a heuristic for determining if a string is a "single emoji" - simpler yet more approximate, catches common cases, likely to handle future emoji expansions too: <code>function is_one_emoji($s)</code> in https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/master/cassis-lab.php ([[selfdogfood]]ing on his own site)

[[Facebook]] reactions to reacji:
* [[granary]] can fetch and convert [[Facebook]] reactions to reacji.

=== Services ===
* [[Bridgy]] [[backfeed]]s [[Facebook]] reactions as of 2016-04-28. [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/626 Details.]

== Brainstorming ==
...

== History ==
=== Slack reacji ===
[[Slack]] was first to ship a built-in reacji feature that allows anyone to respond to any Slack message with a single emoji, which are then tallied like votes.
