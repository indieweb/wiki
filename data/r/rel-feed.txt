{{stub}}

'''<dfn>rel-feed</dfn>''' was a proposal for linking to multiple (potentially alternative) [[h-feed]]s from a site's [[homepage]], which was adding extra work & complexity to existing feed discovery methods, and has been superceded with re-using rel=alternate with type=text/mf2+html to link to h-feed files.

See [https://indiewebcamp.com/h-feed#rel_feed h-feed: rel feed]

== Why ==
You should link to your separate feeds with rel=feed from your home page to:
* [[reader#Autodiscovery_of_h-feeds|Enable readers to automatically find your h-feeds]] ([[h-feed#canonical_feed_autodiscovery|h-feed autodiscovery]])

== How ==
Add the attribute <code>rel="feed"</code> (or append " feed" on an existing rel attribute) on links from your homepage to your separate [[h-feed]] pages.

 <link rel="feed" type="text/html" title="My blog's feed" href="feed.htm" />

=== How on WordPress without any coding ===

If you have a menu link to your main feed, you can add feed to the Link Relationship(XFN) field  in the WordPress menu editor under 'Appearance' in the WordPress admin dashboard.

{{gwg}}'s Indieweb 2016 theme automatically adds a rel-feed to your posts page in if you do not have a feed on your homepage.
