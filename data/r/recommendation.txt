A '''<dfn>recommendation</dfn>''' is a type of post that provides a suggestion to another person. Often this is prompted by someone posting a [[recommendation request]] however, this could be sent unsolicited.

==Facebook Example==

=== Request in Timeline ===

If a user sees a recommendation request on Facebook, they can click a button to search for recommendations within the correct geographic area and select the place they would like to recommend. They can also type in some additional information about why they are recommending the place.

=== Request with Recommendation Responses ===

All recommendations appear as items on the original [[recommendation request]] map as well as comments on the post, with a link preview about the location and the user's recommendation text.

==Brainstorming==

In an indieweb context this sort of functionality is likely to be achieved by accepting a [[Webmention]] on a post.

{{eddiehinkle.com}} - in thinking about this, I think this could be VERY cool when integrated into a reader. If there was parsable mf2 for a recommendation request. That way, if a reader detects a recommendation request, it could provide a similar interface to Facebook, allowing the user to search for a POI to recommend, and then it could create the post via Micropub, which would then be sent via webmention.
