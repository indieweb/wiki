A '''<dfn>recommendation</dfn>''' is a type of post that provides a suggestion to another person.

==Facebook Example==

Facebook has a UI for requesting recommendations from friends within a certain geographical area.

The user requesting recommendations first specifies what sort of recommendations they want and where they should be geographically.

The user can then add the recommendations request to their timeline.

Other users can then search for places to add as recommendations with an add button and search field in the top right of the map.

Recommendations are then saved on the map and appear as a pin with a popup.

==Brainstorming==

In an indieweb context this sort of functionality is likely to be achieved by accepting a [[Webmention]] on a post.

{{eddiehinkle.com}} - in thinking about this, I think this could be VERY cool when integrated into a reader. If there was parsable mf2 for a recommendation request. That way, if a reader detects a recommendation request, it could provide a similar interface to Facebook, allowing the user to search for a POI to recommend, and then it could create the post via Micropub, which would then be sent via webmention.
