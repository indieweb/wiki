'''<dfn>recommendations</dfn>''' are a list or other collection of things, places, and/or experiences that are recommended by someone or a group, on personal websites and on a few silos.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{section-stub}}
Many IndieWeb Examples may also show up as [[lists#IndieWeb_Examples]], however these are specifically recommendations:
* {{gregor}} has a Food and Drink recommendations page (since ????-??-??) that clusters various cities:
** https://gregorlove.com/lists/food-and-drink/

=== Minimal semantic HTML CSS ===
{{t}}: 
* create a minimal semantic HTML + nicer looking CSS equivalent for my Berlin recommendations list to serve on my own site, preferably portable / minimal so others might use it as a starting point
* add a map of all venues, with a blue dot of where you are (by Geolocation API request), especially on mobile, because a map of all the venues would be especially useful on mobile
* mobile view should also have a full bleed of images and lists content to the edges

== Sessions ==
