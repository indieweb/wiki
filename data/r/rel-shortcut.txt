<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>rel-shortcut</dfn>''' is a means of representing key navigational links or opportunities within HTML. This can offer parity with the <code>shortcuts</code> member of the [https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/ Web App Manifest].</span>

== Why ==

When websites are added to a userâ€™s home screen or pinned to the dock/taskbar, it may be helpful for users to have access to key actions or locations within that site. Shortcuts provide that functionality.

== How to use <code>rel="shortcut"</code> ==

The "shortcut" value for <code>rel</code> can be applied in any of a number of ways. If you are interested in promoting your primary navigation to being shortcuts, you can add the <code>rel</code> value directly to those links:

<pre><a rel="shortcut" href="/messages">Messages</a></pre>

Alternately, you could define shortcuts in the <code>head</code> if your document using the <code>link</code> element:

<pre><link rel="shortcut" href="/messages" title="Messages"></pre>

== When to use <code>rel="shortcut"</code> ==

By comparison, the <code>shortcuts</code> member of the [https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/ Web App Manifest] is a much more robust solution, offering the ability to provide a custom icon per shortcut and maintain a single list of shortcuts for an entire site. If you do not have a manifest for your site, however, this declarative model can provide similar utility.
