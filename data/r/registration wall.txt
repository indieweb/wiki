'''<dfn>registration wall</dfn>''' is a UI [[antipattern]] used by some silos (like [[Pinterest]] and [[Quora]]) to prompt users with a sign up or login UI that immediately blocks viewing or using the site, or as immediate requirement to view full content such as an entire article ([[Narrative Magazine]]).

[[Medium]] has iterated on several versions of sign-up or [[login wall]]s, which are sometimes registration walls because they immediately block viewing.
