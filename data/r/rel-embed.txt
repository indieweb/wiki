== Why ==
See [[embed#Why]].

== How to ==
=== How to link to an embed version of a page ===
In the the head of a post [[permalink]] page or home page, create a link with <code>rel=embed</code>, e.g. using markup like this, to the embed version of the page:
<pre>
<link rel="embed" href="{permalink}/embed" />
</pre>

where {permalink} is the original post permalink URL (or home page).

The "{permalink}/embed" is only a convention, and any URL on the same site may be used.

=== How to discover rel embed ===
Consuming code must look for a link element (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>) with <code>rel</code> attribute with an <code>embed</code> value and use that to auto-discover the embedding URL at the <code>href</code> of that link element to present as a UI to publishers etc.
