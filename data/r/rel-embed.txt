== Why ==
See [[embed#Why]].

== How to ==
=== How to link to an embed version of a page ===
In the the head of a post [[permalink]] page or home page, create a link with <code>rel=embed</code>, e.g. using markup like this, to the embed version of the page:
<pre>
<link rel="embed" href="{permalink}/embed" />
</pre>

where {permalink} is the original post permalink URL (or home page).

The "{permalink}/embed" is only a convention, and any URL on the same site may be used.

=== How to discover rel embed ===
Consuming code must look for a link element (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>) with <code>rel</code> attribute with an <code>embed</code> value and use that to auto-discover the embedding URL at the <code>href</code> of that link element to present as a UI to publishers etc.

[[Category:jargon]]

== Historical proposal ==
=== rel embed to display an image ===
There was an old proposal (never implemented) to use a <code>rel</code> value of <code>embed</code> as a verb, that is as an instruction to the browser to embed the referenced URL when displaying that page. This verb instruction meaning is different from the current (2024) proposed noun relationship meaning. Since there was no support of it, it is unlikely there are any instances of this legacy usage, and thus there should be no problems with re-using <code>embed</code> to mean something new.

* 1993-02-26 TimBL: [http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0186.html Re: proposed new tag: IMG] proposed using rel=embed as a verb, though realized its obvious limitation of (inability to handle) embedding icons (other images) which themselves would be hyperlinked to other URLs. <blockquote>I had imagined that figues would be reprented[sic] as <br><br><nowiki><a name=fig1 href="fghjkdfghj" REL="EMBED, PRESENT">Figure </a></nowiki><br><br>where the relation ship[sic] values mean<br><br>EMBED Embed this here when presenting it<br>PRESENT Present this whenever the source document <br>is presented<br><br>Note that you can have various combinations of these, and if <br>the browser doesn't support either one, it doesn't break.<br><br>A[sic] see that using this as a method for selectable icons means nesting <br>anchors. Hmmm.</blockquote> (found via [https://twitter.com/wiumlie/status/1151465652953243649 2019-07-17 tweet])

This unimplemented proposal was re-raised on Twitter over 20 years later, twice, by user "@Meekostuff":
* [https://twitter.com/Meekostuff/status/506770381793800192 2014-09-02]: in response to 2014-09-01 Ars Technica: [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/how-a-new-html-element-will-make-the-web-faster/ How a new HTML element will make the Web faster] ([https://twitter.com/arstechnica/status/506610216851361792 tweet]) about the new <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element. <blockquote>… <nowiki><a rel="embed img" href="{{img src here}}">{{img alt here}}</a> is more flexible than <picture> and is backwards compat.</nowiki></blockquote>
* [https://twitter.com/Meekostuff/status/652455514048040960 2015-10-09]: in response to [https://twitter.com/ade_oshineye/status/652446811047751680 Ade Oshineye tweet] <blockquote>… If AMP said markup images<br><nowiki><a rel="embed image" href="...">Alt text</a></nowiki><br>it'd be valid HTML & useful w/o JS as well as fast.</blockquote>

No further advocacy or mentions since then (9+ years ago).
