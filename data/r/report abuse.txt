'''<dfn>Report abuse</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>report inappropriate</dfn>) is a feature in many (most?) [[silos]] for notifying the silo owners that a specific user, [[post]], or [[comment]] is abusive. This feature is often provided to enable users to report [[spam]] on a silo.

Related but different features:
* [[mute]]
* [[block]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* no known examples of IndieWeb sites with a "report abuse" feature.

== Explicit Report Abuse Posts ==
There are some examples of people using posts themselves to report abuse with citable permalinks. E.g.
* https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl/status/540402809196146688

There is no known examples of silos which have an explicit ability to publish a "report abuse" post on its own permalink, and thus people are using other post types to do so, e.g. a [[note]].

== Silo Examples ==
Examples of [[silos]] which have a "report abuse" feature of some sort, for something that is created on that silo.

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] has some report abuse UI:

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] has been improving their report abuse feature since they launched it.

Currently (2017-03-01) they have a simpler UI, and they seem to be more responsive than they used to be.

Instagram User - on a user's page, there is a "..." in the top left, which when you tap, you get options:
* Block
* Report
* Hide Your [[story|Story]]
* Copy Profile URL
* Share this Profile
* Send Message

If you tap "Report", you get two options:
* It's Spam - if you tap this, you get a thank you acknowledgement and the ability to back-arrow top left out of the profile
* It's inappropriate - (haven't tried this yet)
* Cancel


Experiences:
* {{t}}: Anecdotally I have started to see very fast response to reports of spam, sometimes (like on 2017-03-01) spam accounts are taken down within minutes!
* {{jeremycherfas}} I had to help a user who was being impersonated. That can be done only from within the user's account, except in the case of the parent of a child. From the user's own account, it is a straightforward process that is clearly explained. You have to upload an image of a government-issued ID. The case was resolved in about 6 hours, although no information about the perpetrator was provided. Very impressive.

=== Instagram 2015 ===
[[Instagram]] as of 2015 has a "report abuse" feature for users, photos, and comments.

==== Instagram User ====
On a '''user's "page"''' (e.g. in their iOS app), there is an action (http://www.human-friendly.com/assets/icons/action_icon-2da1ca4aa3599bbf453ba22a81c0e038.jpg) button on the top right, tapping it gives you:
* '''Block User''' menu item - which tapping it gives you an ('''Aside: might be worth moving this to [[block]]''')
** '''Are you sure?''' confirmation alert with buttons
** '''[Cancel] [Yes, I'm sure]''' 
** If you tap "Yes I'm sure", you got a confirmation alert saying 
*** '''User blocked''' with single button 
*** '''[Dismiss]'''
** afterwards the "Block User" item in the action button menu is now an
** '''Unblock User''' menu item - which tapping it gives you an 
** '''Are you sure?''' confirmation alert with buttons
** '''[Cancel] [Yes, I'm sure]''' 
** If you tap "Yes I'm sure", you got a confirmation alert saying 
*** '''User unblocked''' with single button 
*** '''[Dismiss]'''
** afterwards the "Block User" item in the action button menu is back as it was before.
* '''Report Inappropriate''' - if you tap this you get pop-up that overlays their entire UI with a
** '''[Cancel]''' button at the top left on a blue background, and in black/grey on light grey text below that, and a single tappable option below that: <blockquote>'''REPORT THIS ACCOUNT'''<br/>Why are you reporting this acccount?<br/><hr/>I believe this account violates Instagram's community guidelines</blockquote> Tapping that "I believe this ..." option
*** reveals a submenu of: <blockquote>Report a photo, video or comment &gt;<hr/>Report account  &gt;</blockquote> Tapping "Report account" then replaces the entire menu below the [Cancel] button with:
**** <blockquote>Posting annoying content<hr/>Posting spam<hr/>Posting inappropriate content<hr/>This profile is pretending to be someone else<hr/>Belongs to an underage child<hr/>Might be posting my intellectual property without authorization</blockquote> 
***** Tapping "Posting spam" replaces the [Cancel] button and overlay text with <br/>'''[Done]''' button at the top left on a blue background, and in black/grey on light grey text below that: <blockquote>'''THANK YOU'''<br/>Your reports help keep our community free of spam.</blockquote>
***** Tapping "This profile is pretending to be someone else" reveals a submenu of: <blockquote>Me &gt;<hr/>Someone I know &gt;<hr/>A celebrity or public figure &gt;</blockquote>

===== Before 2014-12-07 =====
* '''Report Inappropriate''' - if you tap this you get pop-up that overlays their entire UI with a
** '''[Done]''' button at the top left on a blue background, and in black/grey on light grey text below that: <blockquote>'''THANK YOU'''<br/>We take your reports seriously. We look into every issue, and take action when people violate our Community Guidelines</blockquote>

==== Instagram Photo ====
Just underneath the '''view of a photo''', there is a '''[...]''' other actions button, tapping it gives you:
* '''<span style="color:red">Report Inappropriate</span>''' in red text - tapping that gives you a pop-up that overlays their entire UI with a
** '''[Cancel]''' button at the top left on a blue background, and in black/grey on light grey text below that: <blockquote>'''REPORT PHOTO'''<br/>Why are you reporting this photo?</blockquote> with options:
** '''I don't like this photo'''
*** TBD: what happens when you tap this
** '''This photo is spam or a scam'''
*** TBD: what happens when you tap this
** '''This photo puts people at risk'''
*** TBD: what happens when you tap this
** '''This photo shouldn't be on Instagram'''
*** TBD: what happens when you tap this
==== Instagram Comment ====
If you tap the '''[Comment]''' button underneath ''someone else's'' photo, and then swipe left on an existing comment ''from someone else'', you see:

* red square button with white outline stop sign inside with white exclamation point inside, tapping that pops up a menu from the bottom with:
** '''Why are you reporting this comment?''' with menu items:
** '''<span style="color:red">Spam or Scam</span>''' in red text. If you tap this it removes the comment from your view. It is still visible to anyone else viewing the comments on the photo, including non-logged in users on the web view of the photo.
** '''<span style="color:red">Abusive Content</span>''' in red text. Tapping that gives you a pop-up that overlays their entire UI with a
*** '''[Cancel]''' button at the top left on a blue background, and in black/grey on light grey text below that: <blockquote>'''REPORT COMMENT'''<br/>Why are you reporting this comment?</blockquote> with options:
*** '''I don't like this comment'''
**** TBD: what happens when you tap this
*** '''This comment is spam or a scam'''
**** tapping this dismisses the pop-up overlay and confirms with a brief dropdown saying "Thank you" in white on a green background. The comment is removed from your view. It is still visible to anyone else viewing the comments on the photo, including non-logged in users on the web view of the photo.
*** '''This comment puts people at risk'''
**** TBD: what happens when you tap this
*** '''This comment shouldn't be on Instagram'''
**** TBD: what happens when you tap this
** '''Cancel''' in bluish text - at the bottom after "Abusive Content"

=== Facebook ===

[[Facebook]] lets you report accounts for several different reasons. Upon clicking “Report” on a profile Facebook will use several prompts to walk you through filing the complaint. (Screenshots from Facebook on the web.)

# [[File:facebook-report-what-would-you-like-to-do.png]]
# [[File:facebook-report-what-is-happening.png]]
# …

Facebook offers a “[https://www.facebook.com/support/ Support Inbox]” that shows your reports (do these timeout?) as well as their current status (“in review”, “report reviewed”). You can decide to turn on notifications for review changes here as well. The inbox will update to show Facebook’s final review of your report. (Screenshots from Facebook on [[Android]].)

# [[File:facebook-report-support-message.png|270px]]

After having reviewed your report, you can let Facebook know your feelings about how they handled the report. You select a rating out of 5 smiley faces, from deep frown to big smile, and can optionally leave a message.
