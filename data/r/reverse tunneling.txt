{{stub}}

'''<dfn>reverse tunneling</dfn>''' is a technique for making a service that is behind a firewall available at a public address.

== Examples ==

* [https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/ CloudFlare Tunnel]
* [https://ngrok.com ngrok.com]
* [https://srv.us srv.us]

(Note: Cloudflare Tunnel apparently doesn't work for wildcard domains, but could be used for individual services, e.g. if you wished to setup a subdomain for locally hosted dynamic content like [[webmention]]s, [[micropub]] etc., while keeping the apex domain hosted on static hosting.)
