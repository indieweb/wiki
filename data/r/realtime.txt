{{stub}}

<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Realtime</dfn>''' generally refers to a user experience where content is updated live; for example: a new [[comment]] shows up on a page while you're viewing it, or chat notification "your friend is typing a message."</span>

== Examples ==
* Home page / feed posts: [[How to set up your realtime feed]]
* Permalinks / Post responses: E.g. displaying [[comments-presentation#in_realtime|comments in realtime as received]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Sweetroll ===

[[sweetroll]] has basic realtime support — when the current page is changed, a "reload this page" box appears.

Since Sweetroll knows what feeds are affected by the creation/edit of an entry, this works with categories, tag feeds, as well as the entry's own page. The notifications are delivered via [[server-sent events]], using [https://github.com/myfreeweb/indieweb-components/blob/master/simple-live.js a tiny web component] that unhides itself when a notification that mentions the current page is received.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] shows (since mid 2016?) when someone is writing a comment on your post, in real time as they’re presumably typing:

Screenshot of the bottom of a [[note]] post on a Facebook profile, with the additional message between the webactions buttons and the comment text field:
* "... A friend is typing a comment…"

=== GitHub ===
[[GitHub]] issues show new comments as they are made. I.e. if you are viewing a GitHub issue and are scrolled down to the bottom of the comments, you will see new comments just show up in realtime.

* {{gRegor}}: I was writing a comment on a GitHub issue when a new comment appeared. The entire comment including avatar and username faded in quickly. The display of the comment was otherwise the same as other comments — no special highlighting or border.

* [[comments-presentation]]
* [[reader]]
* [[PubSub]]
* [https://derbyjs.com/ DerbyJS] has a demo on their home page of a barchart with controls you can manipulate that updates in realtime with everyone else viewing / manipulating that same page! Supposedly uses "automatic conflict resolution powered by ShareDB's operational transformation of JSON and text"
