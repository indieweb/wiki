'''<dfn>reposts</dfn>''' are sometimes part of the information about a [[post]] displayed on the post itself, sometimes in a [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]], like a total number [[repost]] responses, icons of recent reposters, or even a datetime ordered list of reposts.

Note: if you're looking for information about a [[repost]] itself, see:
* [[repost]]

== Why ==
__TOC__
By displaying a summary of reposts of your post, you show that there are (and can be more) some light interaction with your post. It also shows immediate feedback to those that have responded to your posts with their own indie repost [[responses]].

== How to ==
=== How to display ===
When a post receives a [[webmention]] from a repost, it can choose to display it similar to a favoriting/liking of that post, as well as optionally displaying a number of reposts.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
The following posts display information about "reposts of" somewhere in their footer / comments, either a count of reposts of the post, and/or listings of the actual reposts of in time sequence order with other activity on the post.

=== Pelle Wessman ===
{{voxpelli}} uses [[webmention.herokuapp.com]] to display a realtime facepile of reposts under each post on his blog, since [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/commit/175a0cf460e3f3d865a6166e5bf7b2a924139b8d 2014-12-30]. [[webmention.herokuapp.com]] can also show likes mixed with the rest of the responses when facepiles has been opted out of.

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} uses [[Kirby]] with his own take on the [https://github.com/sebsel/seblog-kirby-webmentions webmentions plugin] to display reposts and other interactions under his posts. Displays in the same [[facepile]] as [[likes]], but with a repost-icon instead of a heart.
Example: 
* https://seblog.nl/2017/01/07/1/sneeuw

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{ martymcguire}} uses [https://webmention.io/ webmention.io] to display a facepile of reposts under each post on his blog since 2017-03-17. Example:
* https://martymcgui.re/2017/02/24/101739/

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] calls repost posts, "shares". Facebook posts have a repost icon underneath their content, with a count after it.

They also cluster [[notifications]] about reposts of a post. Clicking on such a clustered notification takes you to a page listing all reposts of your post in chronological order, each with their own comments, likes. E.g. 
* https://www.facebook.com/shares/view?id=10101755232551693

Facebook's "share posts" are dynamic / hot-inlined! That is, if you share someone's post, and then afterwards they edit it, your shared copy (if it even is a copy) is edited too! Example: (not sure if this is an any-logged-in-user or only logged-in-friends link) https://www.facebook.com/shares/view?id=10101755232551693

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] calls repost posts, "retweets". Tweet permalinks have a retweet icon underneath their content, and also show [[facepile]] of recent retweeters. If you're logged in you can click and see a list of the reposters.
