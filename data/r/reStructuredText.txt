'''<dfn>reStructuredText</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn><abbr>ReST</abbr></dfn>) is a plaintext-based markup syntax and parser system in use by at least one IndieWeb community member for a personal site or IndieWeb service. It is similar to [[Markdown]], but has a more formal specification.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{section-stub}}
=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} uses [[Read the Docs]] to auto-generate docs for most of his [https://snarfed.org/software open source projects] like [[granary]], [[Bridgy]], etc. He uses [[pandoc]] to convert the source docs from [[Markdown]] to ReST, which then gets fed into [[Sphinx]] to create the final HTML docs.

== Features ==
=== Extendable through directives and roles ===
Unlike most lightweight markup language such as [[Markdown]], ReST has official syntax support for extensions through [https://www.docutils.org/docs/ref/rst/roles.html roles] (inline text) and [https://www.docutils.org/docs/ref/rst/directives.html directives] (blocks). This allows new use-case or product specific transformations to be introduced.

Example use-cases:

* Text marked up with <code>:indieweb:`reStructuredText`</code> might be transformed into a link to this page on the IndieWeb wiki.
* A line containing only <code><nowiki>.. twitter:: https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp/status/1667294256959225856</nowiki></code> might embed the [[This Week in the IndieWeb]] [[Twitter]] post.

Parsers that do not have these extensions will still be able to gracefully fallback (or report errors) as this is part of the ReST syntax.

How to support extensions in different parsers:

* Python: docutils
** [https://www.docutils.org/docs/howto/rst-roles.html Creating reStructuredText Interpreted Text Roles]
** [https://www.docutils.org/docs/howto/rst-directives.html Creating reStructuredText Directives]
* PHP: Doctrine RST Parser
** [https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-rst-parser/en/0.5/custom-directives.html Custom Directives]

== Criticisms ==
=== Python Monoculture ===
Summary: There is difficulty parsing reStructuredText outside of Python or finding any resources to do so.

I always thought it would be easier to use as a base type than Markdown because its extensibility through tags (.. tag::). But always ran into trouble parsing it with anything other than [[Python]] :(</blockquote>
* {{zegnat}}:
** It always felt like there was a [[monoculture]] problem with ReST. There is a big ecosystem in Python land where everyone depends on the docutils package.
** Lots of tools will shell out to Python [https://pypi.org/project/docutils/ docutils] to handle the parsing. One of the few WordPress plugins for ReST [https://github.com/xdissent/wordprest#how-do-i-install-docutils required installing docutils on the server first].
** It is extremely hard to even discover parsers for other languages. Searching npm ([[JavaScript]] package manager) for ‚Äúrestructuredtext‚Äù turns up several plugin-like libraries first such as [https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-restructuredtext gitbook-restructuredtext] and [https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-renderer-restructuredtext hexo-renderer-restructuredtext] (both shell out to run Python docutils‚Äô rst2html) before ending up at [https://github.com/seikichi/restructured restructured]. restructured is an actual JavaScript based parser, but not updated in many years with limited support for the ReST syntax.
** There does not seem to be a public list of parsers nor any sort of compatibility comparison.

=== More Complicated Than Markdown ===
