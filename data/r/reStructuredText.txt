'''<dfn>reStructuredText</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn><abbr>ReST</abbr></dfn>) is a plaintext-based markup syntax and parser system in use by at least one IndieWeb community member for a personal site or IndieWeb service. It is similar to [[Markdown]], but has a more formal specification.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} uses [[Read the Docs]] to auto-generate docs for most of his [https://snarfed.org/software open source projects] like [[granary]], [[Bridgy]], etc. He uses [[pandoc]] to convert the source docs from [[Markdown]] to ReST, which then gets fed into [[Sphinx]] to create the final HTML docs.

== Criticisms ==
=== Difficulty Parsing Outside of Python ===

I always thought it would be easier to use as a base type than Markdown because its extensibility through tags (.. tag::). But always ran into trouble parsing it with anything other than [[Python]] :(</blockquote>
* {{zegnat}}:
** It always felt like there was a [[plurality]] problem with ReST. There is a big ecosystem in Python land where everyone depends on the docutils package.
** Lots of tools will shell out to Python [https://pypi.org/project/docutils/ docutils] to handle the parsing. One of the few WordPress plugins for ReST [https://github.com/xdissent/wordprest#how-do-i-install-docutils required installing docutils on the server first].
** It is extremely hard to even discover parsers for other languages. Searching npm ([[JavaScript]] package manager) for ‚Äúrestructuredtext‚Äù turns up several plugin-like libraries first such as [https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-restructuredtext gitbook-restructuredtext] and [https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-renderer-restructuredtext hexo-renderer-restructuredtext] (both shell out to run Python docutils‚Äô rst2html) before ending up at [https://github.com/seikichi/restructured restructured]. restructured is an actual JavaScript based parser, but not updated in many years with limited support for the ReST syntax.
** There does not seem to be a public list of parsers nor any sort of compatibility comparison.

=== More Complicated Than Markdown ===
