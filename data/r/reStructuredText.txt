'''<dfn>reStructuredText</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn><abbr>ReST</abbr></dfn>) is a plaintext-based markup syntax and parser system in use by at least one IndieWeb community member for a personal site or IndieWeb service. It is similar to [[Markdown]], but has a more formal specification.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} uses [[Read the Docs]] to auto-generate docs for most of his [https://snarfed.org/software open source projects] like [[granary]], [[Bridgy]], etc. He uses [[pandoc]] to convert the source docs from [[Markdown]] to ReST, which then gets fed into [[Sphinx]] to create the final HTML docs.

== Criticisms ==
=== Difficulty Parsing ===
{{zegnat}} noted in chat https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2024-01-03/1704267398609300: <blockquote>looked at ReST at different times. I always thought it would be easier to use as a base type than Markdown because its extensibility through tags (.. tag::). But always ran into trouble parsing it with anything other than [[Python]] :(</blockquote>

=== More Complicated Than Markdown ===

<blockquote>I don‚Äôt like ReST üòÖ <br/>Maybe it is the ‚Äúit is the thing I don‚Äôt know‚Äù effect at play. <br/>But it felt even more complicated than [[markdown]].</blockquote>
