    '''<dfn>robots</dfn>''' are automated scripts that crawl, search, or perform requests for information.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Current examples ===

==== Ben Werdmuller ====
{{benwerd}} runs a bot that responds to requests for information on his own site:
* http://bot.werd.io/

=== Past examples ===

==== capjamesg ====

{{capjamesg}} runs a Discord bot called Cali that plugs into many of James' website tools.

Using Cali, James can:

* post likes, bookmarks, and other social interactions on his website
* get updates via a webhook when a webmention is sent to James site
* get webhook updates when James' site automatically sends a webmention to a URL
* respond to basic conversation features like "hello" and "haha"
* create and keep track of lists
* query Wolfram Alpha
* get the definition of a word from the Merriam-Webster dictionary
* subscribe to an RSS feed and get updates when new content is published

James can also create shortcuts that map a particular sequence of characters to a command without having to manually code a feature into the bot. For instance, James made a command called "yak" which shows a picture of a yak when executed.

Cali's source code is [https://github.com/capjamesg/cali] available on GitHub, although many of its features rely on external APIs. The source code is a good reference point for creating a bot but its exact features may not be available without deploying the same stack as James.

=== Twitter bots ===

There's also a subclass for injecting cuteness, happiness, or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii kawaii] which is related:

== Chat bots ==
Chat bots can help to inject <span id="Kindness">kindness</span> and a standard of care & [[welcoming]] into their environments, though care should be used to ensure that they're having the desired effects.

* "discobot" in the [[Discourse]] fora software welcome people into chat. It will also put up notifications to tell readers things like "Frances has been away for x months, be sure to welcome them back".

** They also automate [[badges]] for users to encourage interaction.

== Wiki bots ==
Wiki bots watch a wiki, report changes, sometimes allow editing via a UI (often through [[#Chat_bots|chat]], sometimes edit a wiki based on time or changes on other sites

* [[Kaja]]
* [[Cali]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== Active or Passive ===
One interesting distinction between bots are ones that are ''active'' where you have to ask it a specific question. Such bots are: {{benwerd}}'s bot, Siri, Alexa, Google Home, etc. A ''passive'' bot is more like Slack bots that might be prompted by certain text that happens. Also [[Loqi]] would be considered a ''passive'' both with some ''active'' options. Much of what Loqi does is watching natural conversation on IRC and replying to it. Although, specific questions around ''What is...'' or ''Who is'' or ''When is...'' could be considered active.
