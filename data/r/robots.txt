    '''<dfn>robots</dfn>''' are automated scripts that crawl, search, or perform requests for information.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} runs a bot that responds to requests for information on his own site:
* http://bot.werd.io/

== Brainstorming ==
=== Active or Passive ===
One interesting distinction between bots are ones that are ''active'' where you have to ask it a specific question. Such bots are: {{benwerd}}'s bot, Siri, Alexa, Google Home, etc. A ''passive'' bot is more like Slack bots that might be prompted by certain text that happens. Also [[Loqi]] would be considered a ''passive'' both with some ''active'' options. Much of what Loqi does is watching natural conversation on IRC and replying to it. Although, specific questions around ''What is...'' or ''Who is'' or ''When is...'' could be considered active.
