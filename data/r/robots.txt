    '''<dfn>robots</dfn>''' are automated scripts that crawl, search, or perform requests for information.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

== Chat bots ==
Chat bots can help to inject <span id="Kindness">kindness</span> and a standard of care & [[welcoming]] into their environments, though care should be used to ensure that they're having the desired effects.

* "discobot" in the [[Discourse]] fora software welcome people into chat. It will also put up notifications to tell readers things like "Frances has been away for x months, be sure to welcome them back".

** They also automate [[badges]] for users to encourage interaction.

== Wiki bots ==
Wiki bots watch a wiki, report changes, sometimes allow editing via a UI (often through [[#Chat_bots|chat]], sometimes edit a wiki based on time or changes on other sites

== Brainstorming ==
=== Active or Passive ===
One interesting distinction between bots are ones that are ''active'' where you have to ask it a specific question. Such bots are: {{benwerd}}'s bot, Siri, Alexa, Google Home, etc. A ''passive'' bot is more like Slack bots that might be prompted by certain text that happens. Also [[Loqi]] would be considered a ''passive'' both with some ''active'' options. Much of what Loqi does is watching natural conversation on IRC and replying to it. Although, specific questions around ''What is...'' or ''Who is'' or ''When is...'' could be considered active.
