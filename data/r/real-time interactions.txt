'''<dfn>real-time interactions</dfn>''' are the display of [[interactions]] on a view of a [[post]] (typically on its permalink) as they are received by the post (presumably via [[webmention]]), without needing any explicit user reloading, refreshing, or any other tapping/clicking etc.

Typical real-time interactions include:
* [[real-time likes]] (favorites)
* [[real-time reposts]] (reshares/retweets)
* [[real-time comments]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com post permalinks to show [http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2013/10/13/1/realtime-indieweb-comments since 2013-10-13]:
* [[real-time comments]]
=== Pelle Wessman ===
[[User:Kodfabrik.se|Pelle Wessman]] uses [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ A WebMention Endpoint] on [http://voxpelli.com/ VoxPelli.com] to show, update and remove [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/releases/tag/v0.4.0 since 2014-12-07]:
* [[real-time comments]]
* [[real-time likes]]
* [[real-time reposts]]

== Silo Examples ==
Real-time interactions are a [[silo]] innovation.
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] was perhaps the first silo to implement real-time interactions since 2012(?) at least, on both post permalinks, and sometimes on posts in a stream or in a collection. In particular, both:
* [[real-time likes]]
* [[real-time comments]]
=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]], as of their mid-2014 front-end redesign, now supports (sometimes) showing real-time interactions on tweet permalinks:
* [[real-time likes]] (favorites in particular - seen once 2014-10-21, but then not when window wasn't frontmost, nor when re-activated)
* [[real-time comments]] (@-replies - seen previously)
Possibly:
* [[real-time reposts]] (retweets in particular - presumably since their display is very similar to favorites, yet a retweet on an item that showed a real-time favorite, did not itself show up).
