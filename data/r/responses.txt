== Silo Examples ==
Nearly all silos ([[Twitter]] or [[Facebook]] for example) support some forms of interaction.

== History ==
There was some [[responses-naming|discussion]] to get rough consensus around what to call the set of things that is replies/comments, reposts/reshares, likes/favorites. This resulted in deciding on the term "responses" as well as "[[reactions]]".
