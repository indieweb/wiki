'''<dfn>responses</dfn>''', or '''<dfn>interactions</dfn>''', in the context of the indieweb, refer to all the different ways and things people explicitly do to and with others‚Äôs [[posts]], from written replies to quick likes, in other words '''responses = [[replies]] + [[reactions]]'''. Common response post types are [[reply]] (comment), [[like]] (favorite), [[repost]] (reshare), and mere mentions.

== Response Post Types ==
* [[reply]]
** [[photo reply]]
** [[video reply]]
* [[like]] / [[favorite]]
* [[repost]]
* [[RSVP]]
* [[bookmark]]
* [[reacji]]
* [[quotation]]
* [[issue]]
* [[invitation]]
* [[tag-of]]
* [[edit]]

Sometimes a response, or possible use-case:
* [[review]]
* [[read]]
* [[listen]]
* [[follow]]

== Displaying a response post ==
See the individual "How to" sections in the above Response Post Types.

=== Individual sets of responses ===
See the following pages for how individual posts display a summary of their responses:
* [[comments]]
* [[likes]]
* [[reposts]]
* [[bookmarks]]
* [[RSVPs]]

=== Overall design of displaying responses ===
(this section is a stub)

This section is for collecting examples related to the overall design of which kinds of responses to display where, in what order, as part of a post. Once we have "enough" examples we can hopefully discern which designs are better than others and document some best practices.

==== Twitter responses UI criticism ====
* Bad displaying responses UI example from [[Twitter]]: https://twitter.com/KennyGesserit/status/1605930553752035328
** "UI design is my passion" [https://linktr.ee/kennygesserit @KennyGesserit] December 22, 2022 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FklpVA7XwAENg4a.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Twitter responses UI annotated with lines cross-connecting responses summary counts and related buttons" style="max-width:50%" />
* Bad displaying responses example 2 from [[Twitter]]: https://twitter.com/KennyGesserit/status/1606056132086321166
** "What the hell is this why is it 5 rows tall?? The average user didn‚Äôt want this" [https://linktr.ee/kennygesserit @KennyGesserit] December 22, 2022 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FknbinrX0BI2Mdo.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Twitter responses UI noting number of lines of information used to communicate various things about a post" style="max-width:50%" />

==== Tweet example of responses text equivalents ====
Meant humorously, but also illustrated a possible way to [[POSSE]] a static snapshot of responses summary numbers:

** "Sir, let me show you how to sort an array in Java script.<br><br>üó®Ô∏è 123k ‚ôªÔ∏è 1.3M ‚ù§Ô∏è 23.6M" [http://www.technofattie.com/ @jwcarroll] January 24, 2023

== IndieWeb Examples ==
See the lists on each of the specific response post type pages.

This section is for examples that show a wide variety of response post types.

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has a good example of a photo post with responses from Twitter (via Bridgy), and various [[Mastodon]] profiles on different servers: https://aaronparecki.com/2019/01/11/28/
* "How did we let the Web get to this point. All I wanted to do was read this blog post." [https://aaronparecki.com/ @Aaron Parecki] January 11, 2019

== Silo Examples ==
Nearly all silos ([[Twitter]] or [[Facebook]] for example) support some forms of interaction.

== History ==
There was some [[responses-naming|discussion]] to get rough consensus around what to call the set of things that is replies/comments, reposts/reshares, likes/favorites. This resulted in deciding on the term "responses" as well as "[[reactions]]".

== See Also ==
* [[post]]/[[posts]]
** [[reply]]
** [[like]]
** [[favorite]]
** [[rsvp]]
** [[repost]]
** [[invitation]]
