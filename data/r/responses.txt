'''<dfn>responses</dfn>''', or '''<dfn>interactions</dfn>''', in the context of the indieweb, refer to all the different ways and things people explicitly do to and with othersâ€™s [[posts]], from written replies to quick likes, in other words '''responses = [[replies]] + [[reactions]]'''. Common response post types are [[reply]] (comment), [[like]] (favorite), [[repost]] (reshare), and mere mentions.

== Post Types ==
* [[reply]]
* [[like]] / [[favorite]]
* [[repost]]
* [[RSVP]]
* [[bookmark]]
* [[reacji]]
* [[quotation]]
* [[invitation]]
* [[tag-of]]
* [[edit]]


Sometimes a response, or possible use-case:
* [[review]]
* [[read]]
* [[listen]]
* [[follow]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
See the lists on each of the specific response post type pages.

== Silo Examples ==
Nearly all silos support some forms of interaction.

== History ==
There was some [[responses-naming|discussion]] to get rough consensus around what to call the set of things that is replies/comments, reposts/reshares, likes/favorites. This resulted in deciding on the term "responses" as well as "[[reactions]]".
