A '''<dfn>[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Redirects redirect]</dfn>''' is a way to automatically make one page on this wiki load another page. You can edit a page and turn it into a redirect by using code like:

<code><nowiki>#redirect:[[destination-page-name]]</nowiki></code>



A broader web-specific version of a '''<dfn>redirect</dfn>''' is a way to send both users and search engines to a different URL from the one they originally requested. The three most commonly used redirects are [[301]], [[302]], and Meta Refresh. These are frequently used/needed when changing [[CMS]]es and potentially the structure of one's [[permalinks]] to get the old URLs to redirect to the new ones.

Here's a useful gist for creating 301 redirects within an .[[htaccess]] file for sites using [[Apache]] : https://gist.github.com/ScottPhillips/1721489
