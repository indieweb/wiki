A '''<dfn>redirect</dfn>''' is a way to send both users and search engines to a different [[URL]] from the one they originally requested. The three most commonly used redirects are [[301]], [[302]], and Meta Refresh. These are frequently used/needed when changing [[CMS]]es and potentially the structure of one's [[permalinks]] to get the old URLs to redirect to the new ones.

== MediaWiki ==

In MediaWiki, a '''<dfn>[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Redirects redirect]</dfn>''' is a way to automatically make one page load another page. You can edit a page and turn it into a redirect by using code like:

<code><nowiki>#REDIRECT:[[destination-page-name]]</nowiki></code>

== WordPress ==

The WordPress [https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/ Redirection] plugin is a useful way to redirect URLs. It also allows monitoring [[404]] errors and quickly creating redirects for them.

== Apache ==

Here's a useful gist for creating 301 redirects within an .[[htaccess]] file for sites using [[Apache]] : https://gist.github.com/ScottPhillips/1721489

== Meta Refresh ==

A static HTML page can indicate with a <code><meta></code> element in the document's <code><head></code> that the browser should redirect to a new location:

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://example.com/new-url" />
  </head>
</html></pre>

Note that this has the drawback of stripping any URL fragment from the redirected URL. For example, [[media fragment]] timestamps for linking to part of a long media file.
