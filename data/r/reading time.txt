{{stub}}

'''<dfn>reading time</dfn>''' is a feature of [[posts]] (usually [[article]]s) that indicates the expected amount of time (typically in minutes) that it would take to read the post.

== Why ==

Knowing roughly how long it will take to read an article will help a reader decide whether they have the time to read an article now or whether they should save it for later.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} has been indicating reading time on his werd.io articles since ????-??-?? (date and citation needed).
* need example article (first article with reading time?)

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has tried posting an article with reading time on 2016-02-17:
* http://tantek.com/2016/048/b1/going-silo-private-prefer-indieweb

=== Rob Weychert ===
{{robweychert}} shows reading time on posts in list views (but not on permalinks) since v6 of his website (2017-09-11). Previously (v5) he showed word counts.

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} shows reading time on list views and in actual posts, on https://www.jvt.me, as well as on [[Twitter]] sharing cards.

=== capjamesg ===

{{jamesgoca}} shows reading time on his articles. He uses a Jekyll front matter variable to calculate the reading time for each post.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Medium]] displays reading time on Medium posts.

== Criticism ==
=== Bad reaction to being told ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455812120724 <blockquote>don't tell me how fast I read</blockquote>
=== First paragraph annoyance ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455805042207 <blockquote>I'm mostly annoyed when the first paragraph of a post in my feed reader is "3 minutes reading time"</blockquote>
=== Does not reflect actual time ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455827541363 <blockquote>maybe I don't like the "3 minutes reading time" thing because it never actually reflects the time I spend reading articles</blockquote>
* Everyone reads at different paces and there is no way to calculate each individual's reading time
* {{jamesgoca}} says "This article takes approximately X minutes to read." This lets a user know that there may be a margin of error around the reading time of a post.
=== Not useful seems arbitrary ===
* https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-02-18/line/1455827821693 <blockquote>i don't find that useful because I don't know what assumptions the author is making about reading times, so the time listed is pretty arbitrary from my perspective</blockquote>
