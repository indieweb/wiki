'''<dfn>recent changes</dfn>''' is a [[stream]] of updated [[posts]] or [[page]]s from a site, ordered by most recently updated first, commonly known from wikis like the IndieWeb https://indieweb.org/Special:RecentChanges page. Such streams often have an associated [[feed file]].


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} uses a built-in WordPress query string on his website to help keep track of recent changes to some of his pages as part of reviewing over his [[commonplace book]]. All [[WordPress]] users or readers of WordPress-based sites can use these:
** [[WordPress]] provides a custom query string (<code>/?orderby=modified</code>) that can be added onto URLs to provide a view of recent updates
*** Example: https://boffosocko.com/?orderby=modified
*** Example of a feed for updates https://boffosocko.com/feed/?orderby=modified
