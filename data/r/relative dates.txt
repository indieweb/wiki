    '''<dfn>relative dates</dfn>''' are a way of converting absolute date-times like year, month, day, and time into a more human friendly expression of time elapsed like "10 minutes ago" or "4 days ago".

== Indieweb Examples ==
[[Known]] shows relative dates on postings. [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-07-07/line/1467918111075 (It uses JS, so the relative dates update while the page is open.)]

[[Bridgy]] show relative dates on webmentions

[[Woodwind]] shows relative dates for posts

[[webmention.herokuapp.com]] generates relative dates for webmentions

== Brainstorming ==
From  IRC:

* [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-07-07/line/1467918225161 aaronpk:] i think my biggest complaint about relative dates is that it's often ambiguous as to when the thing actually happened. github is probably the worst at this.
** e.g. http://werd.io/2016/petition-to-rebrand-great-britain-as-lol-britain "a day ago" was this last night? yesterday morning? <24 hours ago? between 24-48 hours ago?
** "a month ago" is the worst tho. is that last calendar month? what if it's the 1st right now, would something yesterday be shown as a month ago?
**  is it last week? 3 weeks ago? 5 weeks ago?
*[http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-07-07/line/1467922102481 kevinmarks:] I think a smart move for relative datetimes would be to never show 1 of anything
** so 0-119 seconds, 2-119 minutes, 2-47 hours 2-13 days 2-8 weeks, 2-23 months 2- years
** also solves the plural problem, especially if you use 'now' for <2 seconds
** 2-199 years 2-9 centuries 2- millennia

== Pitfalls ==
Pitfalls to avoid when supporting relative dates:
=== Avoid server side relative dates ===
Computing and rendering relative dates on the server and thus directly in your content may have unintended negative consequences:
* '''Misleading archives.''' If you render relative dates server side then you make [[archival_copy|archiving]] worse
** Archives of your content on the [[Internet Archive]] etc. will display an out of date and thus inaccurate relative date.
* '''Spurious modification dates and poor caching behavior.''' If you render relative dates server side then anything checking the content of the page to see if anything has changed will see a different relative date every time and generate spurious deltas, which could also generate spurious HTTP etag headers or if modified since responses

* 2020-12-13 {{edent}}: [https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/12/making-time-more-accessible/ Making Time More Accessible] using the time and abbr elements for relative “ago” dates: <blockquote>… That uses the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> abbreviation element. A sighted reader will see the "1h", a screen reader will read out "One Hour Ago", and someone browsing in text mode will just the "1h".</blockquote>
