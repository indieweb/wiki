{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>relative dates</dfn>''' are a way of converting date-times into a human friendly form like "10 minutes ago" or "4 days ago".

== Indieweb Examples ==
[[Known]] shows relative dates on postings. [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-07-07/line/1467918111075 (It uses JS, so the relative dates update while the page is open.)]

[[Bridgy]] show relative dates on webmentions

[[Woodwind]] shows relative dates for posts

[[webmention.herokuapp.com]] generates relative dates for webmentions

== Brainstorming ==
From  IRC:

* [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-07-07/line/1467918225161 aaronpk:] i think my biggest complaint about relative dates is that it's often ambiguous as to when the thing actually happened. github is probably the worst at this.
** e.g. http://werd.io/2016/petition-to-rebrand-great-britain-as-lol-britain "a day ago" was this last night? yesterday morning? <24 hours ago? between 24-48 hours ago?
** "a month ago" is the worst tho. is that last calendar month? what if it's the 1st right now, would something yesterday be shown as a month ago?
**  is it last week? 3 weeks ago? 5 weeks ago?
*[http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-07-07/line/1467922102481 kevinmarks:] I think a smart move for relative datetimes would be to never show 1 of anything
** so 0-119 seconds, 2-119 minutes, 2-47 hours 2-13 days 2-8 weeks, 2-23 months 2- years
** also solves the plural problem, especially if you use 'now' for <2 seconds
** 2-199 years 2-9 centuries 2- millennia

* Criticism / warning: if you render relative dates server side then you make [[archival_copy|archiving]] worse and generate spurious deltas for etag /if modified since.
