'''<dfn>[https://github.com/themattharris/RelMeAuth/ relmeauth]</dfn>''' is an open source PHP library implementation of the [[RelMeAuth]] protocol.

== Open Source ==
* https://github.com/themattharris/RelMeAuth/

== Why ==
You should use relmeauth.php if you would like to support [[RelMeAuth]] directly on your own site, and your site uses [[PHP]].

== How ==
See https://github.com/themattharris/RelMeAuth/ for instructions on how to use it.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses relmeauth.php on his site tantek.com for RelMeAuth powered sign-in.

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Twitter returning 401 error ===

Make sure that you have a <b>Callback URL</b> set in your [https://apps.twitter.com/ Twitter Apps settings] (when signed into the Twitter account you are using for your RelMeAuth application, likely different than your personal Twitter account).

Not having one causes Twitter to believe your app is a Desktop Application and returns a <samp>401 Unauthorized</samp>.
