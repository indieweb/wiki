The '''<dfn>read-write web</dfn>''' is philosophy and vision for the web that involves the web being a participatory experience.  Notably, the first web browser [[WorldWideWeb]] included a way to author/edit and publish web pages directly from the browser, in addition to its features for [[consumption]].

A technology blog was later launched with the name ReadWriteWeb (now operating as ReadWrite) inspired by this principle.
