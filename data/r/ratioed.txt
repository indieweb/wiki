'''<dfn>ratioed</dfn>''' is either when a post (typically a tweet on Twitter) receives more [[replies]] than [[likes]] (greater than 1 ratio of replies to likes) or when a reply to (presumably disagreeing with) a post receives significantly (a multiplier of) more likes than the post itself, both indicating that the original post stated something likely incorrect or perhaps very unpopular.

* This term typically only applies to platforms for posts where there even is an ability to like a post that is clearly an easier action to take than writing a reply, indicating that many more people decided it was worth the time and energy to write a reply than simply click a like button.
