'''<dfn>rel-authn</dfn>''' is a [[rel|link relation]] that can be added to your [[rel-me]] links to indicate you want to use them as an authentication option in [[RelMeAuth]].

== How ==
=== How to publish ===
For site publishers who want to use their website as their identity (AKA identity providers / IdPs)

Add <code>rel="me authn"</code> to the links you want to be used as an authentication option:

<pre><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk" rel="me authn">github.com/aaronpk</a></pre>

=== How to consume ===
{{section-stub}}
For sites who want to support consuming rel-authn (AKA relying parties / RPs)

In your <code>[[rel-me|rel=me]]</code> consuming code:
* when parsing <code>rel</code> attribute values for <code>me</code>, keep track of all other rel values on each rel-me link.
* if any of those rel-me links has an additional rel value of <code>authn</code>, then drop the rel-me links that lack an <code>authn</code> value
* treat the remaining set of rel-me links as the set to consume to support [[Web sign-in]] (e.g. by presenting only those rel-me links to the user to choose from)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [[indielogin.com]] has supported rel-authn since it launched in 2018:
<blockquote>
If ''any'' of your <code>rel="me"</code> links also include <code>authn</code> in the list of rels, then IndieLogin.com will ''only'' use the links with <code>authn</code>, and will no longer consider your plain <code>rel="me"</code> links as authentication options.

* https://auth.hawx.me/ has supported rel-authn since ????-??-??:
