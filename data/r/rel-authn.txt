{{stub}}

'''<dfn>rel-authn</dfn>''' is a [[rel|link relation]] that can be added to your [[rel-me]] links to indicate you want to use them as an authentication option in [[RelMeAuth]].

== How ==
Add <code>rel="me authn"</code> to the links you want to be used as an authentication option:

<pre><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk" rel="me authn">github.com/aaronpk</a></pre>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [[indielogin.com]] has supported rel-authn since ????-??-??:
<blockquote>
If ''any'' of your <code>rel="me"</code> links also include <code>authn</code> in the list of rels, then IndieLogin.com will ''only'' use the links with <code>authn</code>, and will no longer consider your plain <code>rel="me"</code> links as authentication options.
