A '''<dfn>regular expression</dfn>''' is a sequence of characters used to match, extract, and/or replace patterns in text.

Why use a regular expression? 

Regular expressions can be useful (potentially even comprehensive) for parsing microsyntaxes, e.g. ISO dates.

=== Why not ===
Why not? Using regular expressions to parse more complex syntaxes (e.g. HTML) may lead to very weird errors, and potentially a source of vulnerabilities.

__TOC__
This section is a stub.

Like most coding, find a regular expression that works for your use-case, and copy/paste.

== Flavours ==
There are many different implementations of regular expressions. This means a regular expression that works on one platform may not be supported on an other.

=== PCRE ===
[https://www.pcre.org/ '''PCRE'''], or '''Perl Compatible Regular Expressions''', is an implementation that started 1997 with the aim of bringing [[Perl]]’s regular expressions to other platforms.

Because of its widespread use, it in turn has introduced new syntax. Some of these have then been [https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#PCRE/Python-Support brought back into the original Perl implementation].

Differences between PCRE and Perl are documented [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions#Differences_from_Perl on Wikipedia] and [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.differences.php by The PHP Group].

PCRE2 was released at [https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20150105.162835.0666407a.en.html the start of 2015]. PHP has switched from PCRE to PCRE2 [https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pcre2-migration in PHP 7.3], which was released [https://secure.php.net/archive/2018.php#id2018-12-06-1 in December 2018].

=== POSIX ===

The [[POSIX]] standard defines regular expressions for use by operating systems in an interoperable manner. This flavour is implemented by [[CLI]] tools such as [[grep]].

PHP used to support POSIX Extended regular expressions through [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.regex.php the <code>ereg</code> set of functions]. This was deprecated by PHP 5.3 in favour of the PCRE implementation.

The PHP Group [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.posix.php documents some notable differences between POXIS and PCRE]. These should help getting started on converting between the two formats, though isn’t an extensive comparison.
