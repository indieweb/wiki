A '''<dfn>regular expression</dfn>''' is a sequence of characters used to match, extract, and/or replace patterns in text, used in many IndieWeb implementations and libraries, such as [[autolinker]]s.

Why use a regular expression? 

Regular expressions can be useful (potentially even comprehensive) for parsing microsyntaxes, e.g. ISO dates.

=== Why not ===
Why not? Using regular expressions to parse more complex syntaxes (e.g. HTML) may lead to very weird errors, and potentially a source of vulnerabilities.

* [[html regex]]

== How to ==
__TOC__
This section is a stub.

Like most coding, find a regular expression that works for your use-case, and copy/paste.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses regexes on his personal site’s code in his [[cassis.js]] library for
* [[autolink]]ing - see [https://github.com/tantek/cassis/blob/main/cassis.js#L1312 auto_link_re() function near line 1312]
* extracting: ASIN
* detecting: typical post slug URL segment

== Tools ==
* https://regexr.com/ - excellent regex validator and expression explainer (what each piece does)
* https://regex101.com/ - another regex explainer like RegExr above, this one allows you to write [[tests]]

== Variants ==
There are many different implementations of regular expressions. This means a regular expression that works on one platform may not be supported on an other.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Syntax for documentation of various regular expression syntaxes and variants like <span id="PCRE">[https://www.pcre.org/ PCRE]</span>, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions#Differences_from_Perl differences between Perl Compatible Regular Expressions and Perl], [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.differences.php PHP Group documentation] thereof, [https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pcre2-migration PCRE2 use in PHP 7.3], and <span id="POSIX">[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended POSIX]</span>.
