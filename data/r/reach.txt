{{stub}}

'''<dfn>reach</dfn>''' is usually used to refer to the number or extent of people that see or are at least shown a specific post (of yours) in whatever aggregator or [[reader]] app, site, or home (news) feed feature of a silo that they use to view posts. Many [[silos]] use algorithms (like [[The Facebook Algorithm]]) to limit which posts are shown, as one method to pressure publishers to [[pay for reach]].
