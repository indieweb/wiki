<span class="p-summary">To '''<dfn>read</dfn>''' or <dfn>reading</dfn> is the act of viewing and interpreting [[posts]] or other documents; on the IndieWeb, a '''read post''' expresses that something has been read, like a book or section thereof.</span> This could serve as a way to share books etc. with followers, or to notify the author of a document that you have read it (if the document can receive webmentions).

== Why ==
Read posts serve a potential variety of functionalities including:
* Tracking what you've read as a reminder, potentially with notes for writing a later [[review]]. (See also [[commonplace book]].)
* Keeping track of where you're at in a longer work, particularly when it may not be read in one sitting so that you can come back to the same place at a later time. Compare/contrast this to the idea of a [[bookmark]].
* Provides a potential means of [[discovery]] for readers looking for interesting content.
* Indicate to others what you've explicitly read, particularly as on many social silos people will post articles and there isn't any indication that they've read much beyond the headline. (See articles below.)
** A read post adds some additional information to a post to better differentiate from a [[bookmark]], potentially indicating one wants to read something, as well as [[like|likes]] or [[favorite|favorites]] which don't necessarily indicate the content at the particular link was read.
* Online magazines, newspapers, journals, blogs, etc. might choose to show [[webmentions]] of read posts as a social indicator of how popular or widely read a piece of content is. Compare this with the generic social shares, bookmarks, reposts, etc. which may indicate how broadly a headline was shared without any indication about the piece actually having been read.
* Educators or book clubs might assign reading and read posts and attendant webmentions of those could be conglomerated for potential grading or other online discussion depending on the setting.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} is experimenting with posting to-read posts and reading progress check-ins since 2015-01-25:
* Using [[h-cite]] and linking to a local [[ISBN]] page that redirects to [[Amazon]]
** https://gregorlove.com/2017/01/want-to-read-bad-paper/
** Linking to the local ISBN page means I can change where they redirect to later, as desired.
* 2017-06-25: Worked on a custom version of Quill to post citations / read posts at [[2017/Demos#gRegor_Morrill|2017 IndieWeb Summit]]
* 2017-11-29: Added a page that aggregates my want-to-read posts: https://gregorlove.com/reading/ Notes: https://gregorlove.com/2017/11/i-put-together-a-basic/
* 2017-12-10: Added microformat property <code>p-read-of</code> and <code>p-read-status</code> https://gregorlove.com/2017/12/my-project-for-todays-indiewebcamp/
* 2017-12-13: Added first post with p-read-status=reading https://gregorlove.com/2017/12/currently-reading-a-wrinkle-in/
* 2017-12-17: Added first post with p-read-status=finished https://gregorlove.com/2017/12/i-now-have-at-least/

==== Earlier work ====
From 2015-01 through 2015-02, I experimented with a handful of posts to track my reading progress. I did not continue in part because there were no consumers of those microformats. I also realized I was more interested in the simpler use-case of tracking what I want to read, am currently reading, and have finished reading.

* Start: http://gregorlove.com/2015/01/on-page-0-of-309-1/ (created later, backdated)
* In-progress: http://gregorlove.com/2015/01/on-page-46-of-309-1/
* Finished: http://gregorlove.com/2015/02/on-page-309-of-309-1/
* Want to read: http://gregorlove.com/2016/04/want-to-read-a-kim/

Notes:
* Used <code>p-page</code> and <code>p-total</code> to indicate progress. The percentage complete can be calculated and [[graphed]] from these values.
* Used <code>h-item</code> and <code>u-identifier</code> for the book title. The identifier's href is in the format <code>ISBN:XXXXX</code>.
* Manually [[POSSE]] to [[Goodreads]].
* Feedback is welcome, since this may not be the "best" way.

=== rhiaro ===
{{rhiaro}} displays read posts since [http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/08/1438731932 2015-08-04]. These are different to bookmarks, as I expicitly mean bookmarks as to-read or to-read-again. I expect to add notes (content) to read posts in the future, too. Marked up with the made-up microformat <code>u-read-of</code>.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} is experimenting with posting "read" posts as plaintext [[notes]] of a specific format, based on [[#Tantek_thoughts|his brainstorming thoughts]].

Short stories as part of a volume, starting with "read ", (smart)quoted name of the work, optionally part of what larger work, "by ", name or @-name of author, punctuation of some sort with additional contextual remarks or commentary. Examples:

Books of (collections of) distinct essays, short stories, other writing:
* read named chapter: http://tantek.com/2015/360/t4/read-arsebestos-some-remarks-hardcopy <blockquote>read “Arsebestos” in “Some Remarks” #hardcopy by @nealstephenson, while lying sideways.</blockquote>
** read named chapter with author domain and prev: http://tantek.com/2017/268/t2/read-spew-some-remarks <blockquote>📖 read “Spew” in “Some Remarks” by nealstephenson.com. #hardcopy tantek.com/isbn/0062024442</blockquote>
* with book URL/ISBN: http://tantek.com/2015/360/t5/read-slashdot-interview-some-remarks <blockquote>read “Slashdot Interview” in “Some Remarks” by @nealstephenson. #hardcopy tantek.com/isbn/0062024442</blockquote>

** two authors: http://tantek.com/2017/200/t1/started-eight-limbs-of-yoga <blockquote>📕 started reading “The Eight Limbs of Yoga” by Stuart Ray Sarbacker and Kevin Kimple. tantek.com/isbn/086547768X #yoga</blockquote>
* “read ch.” with 📖 open book emoji, when/where, reaction: http://tantek.com/2016/262/t3/read-ch-45-first-fifteen-lives-harry-august <blockquote>📖 read ch. 45 of “The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August” on the flight. Really enjoying it. tantek.com/isbn/0316399620</blockquote> Chapter abbreviated to ch. to make post POSSE (re)tweetable in its entirety.

*** And I now (2016) prefer "chapter 7 of" instead of "chapter 7 in"
* “finished” with emoji, URL, vague time of finishing (since "read" post was delayed): http://tantek.com/2016/279/t2/finished-reading-before-tomorrowland <blockquote>📕 finished reading “Before Tomorrowland” by Jensen, Case, Bird, Lindelof last night. #hardcopy tantek.com/isbn/1484704215</blockquote> (#hardcopy really should have been #hardcover to indicate version)
* ”finished” with emoji, URL, when/where finished: http://tantek.com/2016/272/t1/finished-first-fifteen-lives-harry-august <blockquote>📕 finished reading “The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August” by Claire North on the flight home. tantek.com/isbn/0316399620</blockquote>

Magazines / periodicals, progress, and articles read:
* “read pages ” n-m with 📖 open book emoji, where, #hardcopy hashtag to indicate physical copy, link to online version, time/page# ordered list of article names (from print edition) and corresponding URLs to online versions of articles, grouped by magazine section
** http://tantek.com/2016/362/t2/read-scientific-american-mind-hardcopy


Will likely only post when I've finished reading a complete "chunk" of a work, a named section or numbered chapter perhaps.

=== Ryan Rix ===
{{rrix}} has posted Read items on [https://indiewebcamp.com/User:Notes.whatthefuck.computer#Arcology Arcology] since it was created, as a way to signal other people that something is worth reading. Read posts are treated identically to regular posts, or notes, but with a URL in the heading and body. Some notes contain a pull quote or comment on the article, which are just shoved in to the e-content like any other post.

Most read items are pointing to blog posts or other online "long reads" though they could also link to books on [[Amazon]] or so, as I am doing reading through a book and taking notes as I go.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
Beginning in the late summer of 2016, I began posting read books along with reviews, [[highlight]]s, notes, and [[marginalia]] on my site to a great extent owning large portions of data that I now [[POSSE]] (manually) to GoodReads.com, Amazon, and other book related [[silo]] services. In large part I'm using many of the ideas from [[#Chris Aldrich thoughts|brainstorming thoughts]] below along with thoughts here from Tantek and others. A good example of such a post can be found at [http://boffosocko.com/2012/06/17/big-history/ Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History]. Another post which includes links to individual status updates of interstitial progress can be found [http://boffosocko.com/2016/09/23/fletch-by-gregory-mcdonald-book-review/ here].

Beginning on [http://boffosocko.com/2016/10/30/chris-aldrich-is-reading-instapaper-is-joining-pinterest/ 10/30/16] I began owning the articles I'm actively reading online using a modified [[PESOS]] workflow using both [http://www.reading.am Reading.am] and [[IFTTT]]. It's described in more detail at [http://boffosocko.com/2016/11/20/owning-my-online-reading-status-updates/ Owning My Online Reading Status Updates]. In this workflow, I actually prefer to bookmark the article I'm reading in real time and the PESOS workflow allows/reminds me to post notes/thoughts to the post once I'm finished reading, or very shortly thereafter.

[http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/31/pressforward-as-an-indieweb-wordpress-based-rss-feed-reader-pocketinstapaper-replacement/ In December 2016], I began using [[PressForward]] to internally save private [[bookmarks]] for web-based articles/pages I want to [[read later]], as well as a way to easily publish them as [[read]] posts when done. PressForward saves the canonical URL of the original post and allows a setting for the archived post on my own site to forward to the original after a set number of seconds.

On 2017-01-07, I began pinging the Internet Archive with URLs of both my own posts as well as links within posts using [https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-archival/ Post Archival in the Internet Archive] in a method similarly suggested previously by {{adactio}}.

2017-12-11 [http://boffosocko.com/2017/12/11/an-update-to-read-posts-for-physical-books/ Expanded microformats mark up of read posts for physical books]. 

=== Jeremy Cherfas ===
{{jeremycherfas}} in [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/setting-my-marginalia-free February 2017] began posting reviews of books he's read along with notes and [[highlight]]s, and [[marginalia]] from his Amazon Kindle.
Example: [https://www.jeremycherfas.net/reviews/cuisine-and-empire-cooking-in-world-history Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History]

=== ColoradoBoulevard.net ===
2018-05-29: While [https://coloradoboulevard.net/ ColoradoBoulevard.net] can easily support posting reads, as a local newspaper for the Pasadena, CA and surrounding areas, it focuses more on displaying webmentions for [https://boffosocko.com/2018/05/29/indieweb-ifying-coloradoboulevard-net/ incoming read posts]
* Example of [[facepile|facepiling]] received webmentions including [[like|likes]] and [[read|reads]]

{{jamietanna}} now tracks reads on https://www.jvt.me/kind/reads/ i.e. https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/09/zrpkc/

=== Tracy Durnell ===
{{tracydurnell}} started publishing book reviews as [https://tracydurnell.com/kind/read/ read posts] in Fall 2020.
* Most posts link to the book's [[Goodreads]] page, alternatively the book page on the author or publisher's website
* Non-fiction book read posts also include highlights exported from Kindle, manually organized and formatted -- as of summer 2022, posts with extensive notes are set to private 
* Manually [[POSSE]] reviews (sometimes condensed) to [[Goodreads]]
* Books read each year are grouped on [https://tracydurnell.com/reading-list/ a page] as an <code>h-feed</code>, with each book marked as <code>h-cite book</code>, and <code>p-name booktitle</code> for book title and <code>p-author</code> for each author
* No star ratings, but indicate books liked or loved with thumbs up emojis 👍
* Current reading is listed on the same page, not as a feed
* Did not finish books are also listed on the same page, not as a feed

{{claudinec}} since 2024-04-01: a simple single [https://www.claudinec.net/reading/ Reading] page, using [[Hugo]] shortcodes for minimalistic metadata ([https://www.claudinec.net/posts/2024-04-02-hugo-shortcode-books/ thought process here])

== Tools ==
=== indiebookclub ===
[[indiebookclub]] is a [[Micropub]] client for posting read posts to your site. It can also consume the <code>read-of</code> microformat from a URL to pre-populate the new post form.

=== Semantic Linkbacks WordPress Plugin ===
The [[Semantic Linkbacks]] [[WordPress]] plugin consumes the <code>read-of</code> microformat to display a separate facepile of people reading the post. See [[#ColoradoBoulevard.net]] above.

=== Managing Kindle highlights with Python and GitHub ===
A [[python]] script to extract notes and highlights from Kindle and created a [[Markdown]] formatted file that could then be stored on Github or elsewhere. See [https://duarteocarmo.com/blog/managing-kindle-highlights-with-python-and-github.html]

=== IndiePass ===

[[IndiePass]] supports posting reads using [[Micropub]] form requests.

== Other Examples ==
Other interesting or notable examples of people posting about reading on the web, perhaps lists of articles or books they have read, perhaps on another site but not on a "read" post silo.

=== Nieman Lab ===
Assuredly in part to feed their reportage and research, The Nieman Lab publishes a "What we're reading" section on their website at https://www.niemanlab.org/reading/
<blockquote>We keep an eye out for the most interesting stories about Labby subjects: digital media, startups, the web, journalism, strategy, and more. Here’s some of what we’ve seen lately.</blockquote>


== Brainstorming ==

=== Tom Morris ===
* tommorris.org: [http://cl.ly/image/3V2Y281F3w3D book checkin] prototype design (screenshot)

=== Tantek thoughts ===
Some thoughts from having experimented with a couple of "read" posts (see [[#Tantek|above]]).

* [[text-first design]] - here's a modest design for the plain text versions of "read" posts (suitable to get started with posting on your own site, and [[POSSE]]ing to text-primary destinations like [[Twitter]].
** simple: <samp>📕 read “</samp>{name-of-work}<samp>” by </samp>{name or @-name of author}<samp>.</samp>
** chapter/section: <samp>📖 read </samp>{name-number-of-section-chapter}<samp> in/of “</samp>{name-of-work}<samp>” by </samp>{name or @-name of author}<samp>.</samp>
*** e.g. "📖 read chapter 7 of …"
*** or shorten chapter to "ch." for POSSE tweet shortening purposes.
The terminating period (<samp>.</samp>) in each example could be any punctuation, other sentence terminators (!), or a comma(,) indicating commentary afterwards.

* continuing with the design, some optional aspects following the above
** [[hashtags]], e.g. 
*** <samp>#hardcopy</samp> indicating something was read in physical printed (on paper) form.
** {URL} to the work itself online, or an online representation of a physical product
** other commentary
** terminating with a [[permashortlink]] or [[permashortcitation]].

Details of terminology used in text-first design:
;read
:meaning I started and finished reading it in close temporal proximity
;started reading (note [https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%22started%20reading%22&src=typd Twitter search/usage])
;finished reading (haven't used yet, but thinking about)
:meaning I started reading this sometime in the past (days, months, years? ago), and just now finished reading it.
;in
:indicates section/chapter as part of some larger work. any following information (hashtags, URLs) apply to the larger work
;by
:prefix indicating author information follows, either as an @-name, or Capitalized Full Name

Considering:
* a leading emoji at the start like the musical note for [[jam]] posts, e.g.
** 📕📗📘📙📚📖
* perhaps separate emoji for particular sub-types of read posts, e.g.
** 📕 started reading / read / finished reading a whole book - good default. when you start you’re about to open the book, and when you finish, you’ve closed the book.
** 📗 ... a whole book that is second in a series
** 📘 ... third in a series
** 📙 ... fourth in a series
** 📚 ... a trilogy / set of books
** 📖 read / finished reading a section or chapter of a book, or perhaps just even up to a page number, but have not yet finished the book.
** ...

=== Chris Aldrich thoughts ===
Having played with nearly every reading app and website in existence, I've been contemplating the time-changing nature of reading related posts. I've written some [http://boffosocko.com/2016/08/22/a-new-reading-post-type-for-bookmarking-and-reading-workflow/ ideas and thoughts based on past experiments and UI examples from reading/book-based silos for future implementation]. The tl;dr is a reading post type that subsumes the longer workflow of [[read later]] >> [[bookmark]] >> notes/[[highlight]]/[[fragmention]]/[[annotations]]/[[marginalia]] >> [[read]] >> [[review]]. Thoughts for concatenating verbiage are appreciated. The linked post also includes some screenshots of silo-based systems and UI.

I like Tantek's thoughts about using emoji as visual indicators, particularly when [[POSSE]]ing to platforms like Twitter. I'm considering ([http://boffosocko.com/2016/09/03/fletch-too-by-gregory-mcdonald-book-review/ example]) using the following as indicators within my workflow described above: 

* 🔖 Bookmark: To indicate interest or "want to read" or generally come back to [[read later]]
* 📖 Open Book or 🕮 New book: To indicate either I'm currently reading or haven't yet finished a longer work; equivalent to a location [[checkin]] within a longer piece. Potentially also including a progress of either % or page X of Total.
* 📓 Notebook or 📔 Notebook with Decorative cover: for general notes taken while reading
* 📑 Bookmark Tabs: to indicate stopping points or points of interest within the text. This seems to be a better visual use case for moving a bookmark though a text
* 🗟 Page with Circled Text: For [[highlight]]/[[fragmention]] other [[annotations]] 
* 🙶  Sans-serif Heavy Double Turned Comma Quotation Mark Ornament: For pull quotes from read material
* 📕 Closed book: to indicate I've "finished reading" (This has the added benefit that on [http://www.iemoji.com/view/emoji/730/objects/closed-book most systems] it renders in the color red to visually intimate "stop" as well; compare with 📗 Green Book, which ''could'' be used to indicate "starting" a book)
* ...

=== Read Receipts ===
{{main|read receipt}}
A read post in reply to a [[message]], from one of the recipients of that message, is a read ''receipt'' of that message.

=== Micropub client ===
There was some discussion about a [[micropub]] client for posting books being read/completed: https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-06-09#t1465505870288

=== gRegor Morrill thoughts ===
Thoughts on how to mark up, based on my experience and on [[indiebookclub]]:

==== mark up and post a ''read'' ====
To post a read, the post's [[h-entry]] should have properties:
* <code>p-x-read-status</code>: indicates the status of the read post
** current values being used: <code>to-read</code>, <code>reading</code>, and <code>finished</code>
* <code>p-read-of</code> (or <code>u-read-of</code>): indicates what is being read
** it's recommended to use an [[h-cite]] for this so you can include author and [[uid]] information ([[ISBN]] or [[DOI]]), but you can use just the title as a minimum viable read post.
** <code>u-read-of</code> may be preferable if the h-cite includes a URL. This depends on whether the consumer expects a URL or the name of what's being read. If there is no URL in the h-cite, the value will be the plain text of the h-cite, including author name and ISBN/DOI.

A minimal post indicating you want to read ''[[Kill Process]]'' would be:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
	<span class="p-summary"><data class="p-x-read-status" value="to-read">Want to read</data>: <cite class="p-read-of h-cite">Kill Process</cite></span>
</div>
</nowiki></pre>

A more complete post would use an h-cite as the <code>p-read-of</code>, with the author and uid:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
	<span class="p-summary"><data class="p-x-read-status" value="to-read">Want to read</data>: <span class="p-read-of h-cite"><cite class="p-name">Kill Process</cite> by <span class="p-author">William Hertling</span>, ISBN: <span class="p-uid">9781942097037</span></span>
</div>
</nowiki></pre>

==== on the read-status property ====
In #microformats chat [https://chat.indieweb.org/microformats/2018-07-09#t1531169722471100] with {{t}} about adding proposed properties to the h-entry spec, I realized that <code>read-status</code> may be an overly-specific property name. There's potential for similar properties to proliferate for [[listen]], [[watch]], and [[exercise]] posts (listen-status, watch-status, exercise-status), so there's definitely more work to be done before moving the property through the standardization process.

Since read-status is actually an experimental property at this point, ideally it should be published as <code>p-x-read-status</code> as reflected in the updated examples above.

=== Linking to a book ===
Thoughts, approaches, and examples on linking to [[book]]s.

It’s not clear what's the best approach, from a usability/user-friendliness perspective, a link-robustness perspective, etc. Worth documenting existing practices, brainstorming possible alternatives, and how they may be better or worse.

'''Using a local to domain link that live redirects:'''
* {{t}} examples (list above at [[#Tantek]]) use an autolinked tantek.com/isbn/*** URL which algorithmically redirects to an Amazon URL for that *** ISBN
** Advantage: it can be changed in the future to redirect somewhere else
* ...

'''Using multiple direct links:'''
* '''Brainpickings''' uses a format of '''BOOKNAME (public library)''' where BOOKNAME is the full name of the book, hyperlinked to its Amazon product page, and "public library" is literal text, linked to its worldcat.org page.
** E.g. https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/31/how-to-love-thich-nhat-hanh/ <blockquote>[http://www.amazon.com/Love-Mindful-Essentials-Thich-Nhat/dp/1937006883/ How to Love] ([http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-to-love/oclc/880566606 public library])</blockquote>(links modified to remove any tracking codes / referrers)

'''Browser Extensions for free local resources'''
There's a free, non-commercial browser extension called [https://www.libraryextension.com/ Library Extension] which allows users to specify their local library(s) such that when landing on most commercial book seller pages online, the extension will add a box of information showing free available physical and electronic copies of books and other media at a local library. It also has quick link buttons for allowing the person viewing the site to place holds on them or retrieve them immediately. This is quite similar to a related browser extension [http://libx.org/ LibX] which focuses on academic libraries and also shows the available journal articles available by proxy through research libraries. It would be nice if there were a proxy service available for these that would allow the building of URLs to help focus and center free local library holdings to users who clicked on these links.

'''Non-commercial online catalogues'''
Sometimes a website owner may have moral, ethical, or other reasons for not wanting to link to and support the commercial sales of books and media through particular for-profit online silos like [[Amazon]], [[Goodreads]], [https://bookshop.org/ BookShop.org] or other similar retailers even if they provide affiliate links which compensate the site owner for recommending books.

To help remedy this, below is a list of common public library sites which encourage freely available public resources without centering corporations and profitmaking.

* '''[https://www.worldcat.org/ WorldCat]''' is an online library catalogue which lets you search the collections of libraries in your community and thousands more around the world. WorldCat grows every day thanks to the efforts of librarians and other information professionals. Users with accounts can specify their local libraries so that searches of materials will show local copies that are available for them to check out for free. More details available at: https://www.worldcat.org/whatis/default.jsp

* '''[https://openlibrary.org/ Open Library]''' is a catalog and platform not too dissimilar to [[Goodreads]]. The ultimate goal of the Open Library is to make all the published works of humankind available to everyone in the world. It is is an initiative of the [[Internet Archive]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit, building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form. The catalog is easily editable so that materials can be added directly and linked to if they didn't previously exist in the catalog.

* '''[https://archive.org/ Internet Archive]''' is a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more.

* '''[https://www.wikidata.org/ Wikidata]''' is a non-profit database included information about books, academic articles, movies, dramas, operas, musics, albums, games, etc, which all published under [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en CC0].

* '''[https://inventaire.io/ inventaire]''' can import books information from Wikidata, and support ActivityPub.

=== Daily Summaries ===
{{t}} For articles I read on the web, rather than post individual read posts, I’d like to post a daily read [[collection]] post. Is anyone doing this?

Similarly [[bookmark#Daily_Summaries|for bookmarks]].

== Silo Examples ==
=== Goodreads ===
* [[Goodreads]] allows you to check-in your reading progress.

==== Goodreads to FB ====
Goodreads has a way to [[cross-posting|cross-post]] your "read" (and [[review]]) posts to your Facebook profile.
