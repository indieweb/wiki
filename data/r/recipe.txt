{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>recipe</dfn>''' is special kind of post, that typically has a name, like an [[articles]], a list of ingredients, and a list of instructions for making something, usually [[food]] or [[drink]].

== Why ==
Consider posting recipes for food or drink that you personally enjoy making & consuming, especially recipes you come up, so others may also enjoy making & consuming said food or drink.

== How ==
__TOC__

=== How to publish ===
In your recipe, provide a short summary description, and then a clear minimal list of ingredients and brief list of instructions, for easy reference for someone following the recipe.

Additionally, consider describing variants you’ve tried or made, and how you personally relate to the recipe.

=== How to mark up ===
Mark up your recipe posts with [[h-recipe]].
* If your recipe has a name use "p-name" for it.

Consider marking up your recipe also with the classic [[hRecipe]] since a few consuming applications (like [[Paprika]]) and services (like Google Recipe Search) still use it.

DO NOT enclose it an [[h-entry]] - there is no need to do so.

If you want to separately post a [[note]] about creating or using the recipe on a particular day, then that makes sense as a separate [[h-entry]] post that would/could then link to the recipe on its own permalink.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
