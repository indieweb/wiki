{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>recipe</dfn>''' is special kind of post, that typically has a name, like an [[articles]], a list of ingredients, and a list of instructions for making something, usually [[food]] or [[drink]].

== Why ==
Consider posting recipes for food or drink that you personally enjoy making & consuming, especially recipes you come up, so others may also enjoy making & consuming said food or drink.

== How ==
__TOC__

=== How to publish ===
In your recipe, provide a short summary description, and then a clear minimal list of ingredients and brief list of instructions, for easy reference for someone following the recipe.

Additionally, consider describing variants you’ve tried or made, and how you personally relate to the recipe.

=== How to mark up ===
Mark up your recipe posts with [[h-recipe]].
* If your recipe has a name use "p-name" for it.

Consider marking up your recipe also with the classic [[hRecipe]] since a few consuming applications (like [[Paprika]]) and services (like Google Recipe Search) still use it.

DO NOT enclose it in an [[h-entry]] - there is no need to do so.

If you want to separately post a [[note]] about creating or using the recipe on a particular day, then that makes sense as a separate [[h-entry]] post that would/could then link to the recipe on its own permalink.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

==== Chris Aldrich ====
[http://www.boffosocko.com Chris Aldrich] has been publishing recipes marked up with mf1 as hrecipe since 7/4/15 and mf2 as h-recipe since 7-20-16. Incidentally as of July 2016, [[WordPress]] (via JetPack) supports a [https://en.support.wordpress.com/recipes/ recipe shortcode] which automatically adds sparse mf1 markup. Chris hopes to [https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/4470 encourage] them to additionally add mf2 markup as well. Those who'd like the modified JetPack code can find it [https://github.com/chrisaldrich/jetpack/pull/1/commits/f914ebe3bd573d1d6d42c5b7752bf26c41448a3b here].

=== @cookbook ===
Maureen Evans has been posting recipes on twitter at [https://twitter.com/cookbook @cookbook] in a text picoformat. 

Her abbreviations were previously documented in a Google Sheet [http://cookbookglossary.pbworks.com/w/page/9614902/FrontPage embedded on a wiki] but as of 2023-08-11, the spreadsheet appears to have been deleted. It could not be retrieved from the [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222164745/http://cookbookglossary.pbworks.com/w/page/9614902/FrontPage archived page] either. If you have access to these abbreviations, please help update this section as they could be expanded to h-recipe.

== Applications ==
=== Paprika ===
The [[Paprika]] Recipe Manager application parses classic [[hRecipe]] from the web.

=== Google Search ===
Google search recognizes [[hRecipe]] results, but [https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/recipe requires schema.org markup] to support "Guided Recipes" with Google Assistant

== Issues ==
=== Extraneous content ===
Perhaps the top complaint about online recipes is the presence and length of content or ads on a recipe page that is beyond the ingredients, instructions, and other directly related information for a recipe.

There are quite a few openly posted complaints both about the common and heavy presence of such extraneous content, defense thereof by recipe authors and publishers, and some amount of contentious ([[social media]] drama) debate or exchanges of frustration between the two.

To-do:
* incorporate extraneous content complaints / defense from the See Also section

== Brainstorming ==
=== Plain text recipe formats ===
* Plaintext language for marking up recipe metadata https://cooklang.org/

For possible consideration in a plain text recipe in a post.
