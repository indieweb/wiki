'''<dfn>recipe</dfn>''' is special kind of post, that typically has a name, like [[articles]] do, a list of ingredients, and a list of instructions for making something, usually [[food]] or drink.

== Why ==
Consider posting recipes for food or drink that you come up with that you think your friends will enjoy.

== How ==
__TOC__

Mark up your recipe posts with [[h-recipe]].
* If your recipe has a name use "p-name" for it.

Consider marking up your recipe also with the classic [[hRecipe]] since a few consuming applications (like [[Paprika]]) and services (like Google Recipe Search) still use it.

DO NOT enclose it an [[h-entry]] - there is no need to do so.

If you want to separately post a [[note]] about creating or using the recipe on a particular day, then that makes sense as a separate [[h-entry]] post that would/could then link to the recipe on its own permalink.

==== Chris Aldrich ====
[http://www.boffosocko.com Chris Aldrich] has been publishing recipes marked up with mf1 as hrecipe since 7/4/15 and mf2 as h-recipe since 7-20-16. Incidentally as of July 2016, [[WordPress]] (via JetPack) supports a [https://en.support.wordpress.com/recipes/ recipe shortcode] which automatically adds sparse mf1 markup. Chris hopes to [https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/4470 encourage] them to additionally add mf2 markup as well. Those who'd like the modified JetPack code can find it [https://github.com/chrisaldrich/jetpack/pull/1/commits/f914ebe3bd573d1d6d42c5b7752bf26c41448a3b here].
