https://indieweb.org/reply-context-examples

'''<dfn>reply context examples</dfn>''' are real-world examples of [[reply-contexts]] on both indieweb sites and [[silos]], how they are presented, their visual design & UI, both on permalinks & in-stream.

== Add Examples ==
Please add examples!

If you support [[reply-context]]s on your site, please take a screenshot of a particularly good example (the nicer looking the better, though any example is good), upload it to the wiki, and add a subsection for yourself in the "IndieWeb Examples" section below.

If you see a nice reply-context design on a silo, take a screenshot of it, upload it, and document it in the Silo Examples section. It's ok to document multiple examples per silo as sometimes they change their UI over time and it's helpful to see what design iterations they've gone through.

== Indieweb Examples ==

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] which shows reply-contexts for replies on aaronparecki.com:

==== reply to a note ====
Reply context with original post text (auto-linked), dt-published (linked to original post permalink), author name/photo/URL:

[http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/19/2/indieweb <img src="https://indieweb.org/images/c/c8/example-reply-showing-context-aaronpk.png" style="max-width:66%" alt="A reply on Aaron Parecki’s site stating “It worked …” with a grey background box above it showing the post it is replying to in a slightly smaller font size" />]

* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/19/2/indieweb
* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/25/1/indieweb-qs

==== reply to a deleted note ====
* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/05/17/1/ is a reply to a tweet which was later deleted. Instead the reply-context shows and links to the IRC log of the deleted tweet.

==== multireplies ====

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} on werd.io, using [[idno]]'s reply context presentation:

Reply context is shown with a "reply" arrow/icon, followed with the text "Replied to a post on ", then the domain of the original post, e.g. "bret.io", and finally a colon ":", where "a post on {domain}:" is hyperlinked to the URL of the original post. This feature was introduced on June 24, 2013.

[[File:Screen_Shot_2013-07-23_at_3.10.29_PM.png|link=http://werd.io/view/51c921fcbed7de745b274ae6]]


Multiple reply contexts are also possible:

=== Kartik Prabhu ===
{{kartikprabhu}} (as of 2014-04-30) Reply context shows a "In reply to" caption followed by a list of hyperlinked urls of the original post.

[[File:KP-reply-context.jpg|500px|link=https://www.kartikprabhu.com/notes/disappearing-ny-book]]

=== gRegor Morrill ===
As of 2015-12-26, reply context shows the author photo, author name, author URL, original post link, and plaintext content. Examples:
* http://gregorlove.com/2015/07/solution-or-go-home-couldnt/ <br/>[[File:gregorlove-reply-context-2015-12-26.png]]
* reply to a public tweet: http://gregorlove.com/2015/12/and-thanks-for-all-the/
* reply to a private tweet: http://gregorlove.com/2015/12/girlvsplanet-thanks/

'''Previously:'''
As of 2014-06-25, reply context shows "In reply to a [post on domain]," with "post on domain" being a link to the original post.

Example from http://gregorlove.com/notes/2014/06/26/1/

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} uses [[Red Wind]] to show reply contexts on [https://kylewm.com/ kylewm.com] replies to others' [[notes]] since 2014-10-16 '''(needs permalink and preferably earlier/earliest example)''':

[[File:kylewm-reply-context-2014-10-16.png|border|500px]] 

And photo reply contexts on replies to others' [[photos]] since (at least?) [https://kylewm.com/2014/05/i-used-to-live-in-bernal-heights-when-i-lived-in-the-city-looks-like 2014-05-07]:
* https://kylewm.com/2014/05/i-used-to-live-in-bernal-heights-when-i-lived-in-the-city-looks-like

=== Greg ===
[[User:unrelenting.technology|Greg]] displays photos in reply contexts, from https://unrelenting.technology/replies/2017-01-06-17-05-01

[[File:unrelenting-technology-photo-reply-context.png|border|500px]]

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} displays the following pieces of information in reply context boxes (when such information is available to retrieve):

* Article title
* Author (fallback to domain on which content was published)
* Article description
* Author icon

James' Micropub client first aims to retrieve this information using h-entry and h-card markup. If this markup is not available, the client will aim to extract the information above (excluding author icon) using another method.

[[File:james_reply_context.png]]

=== {{jacky}} ===
When using [[Koype]], it attempts to capture as <em>much</em> information about the remote URL that can be used for a reply context as such but not limited to:

* Author information (to build as complete as a [[h-card]] as possible)
* Tags, [[syndication|syndication information]], alternate URLs
* Media like [[video|videos]], [[photo|picture]] and [[audio]] markup

It happens first using native MF2 parsing, failing that sending the URL through [[pipes]] and if that doesn't work, building a "synthetic" representation of the MF2 from things like <code><title></code>, <code><meta name="description"></code> and <code><link rel="author"></code>.

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} uses a mix of [[pipes]] services to retrieve a Microformats2 cite of a post, which is then stored in his site, and used to render the reply context.

For instance:

- context for a Twitter interaction https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2022/03/b9kel/
- context using OpenGraph https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2022/03/6baq0/
- context using Microformats2 https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2022/03/k2e5x/

=== Past Examples ===
Past IndieWeb examples where the permalinks either no longer work or no longer display the reply post.

==== Sandeep Shetty ====
On sandeep.io:

Reply context with original post text (using the site-wide consistent blockquote convention for quoting external content), author name (linked to  author URL) and link to original post permalink. I used to also show  dt-published and author photo (similar to this like-context: http://indiewebcamp.com/File:sandeep.io-like-example.png) but [http://www.sandeep.io/56 redesigned] it to [http://www.sandeep.io/90 emphasize content].

[[File:converspace-reply-context.png|link=http://www.sandeep.io/32]]

==== Bret ====
Bret.io used to show reply contexts with a "reply" arrow/icon, followed with the text "Replied to a post on ", then the domain of the original post, e.g. "werd.io", and finally a colon ":", where "a post on {domain}:" is hyperlinked to the URL of the original post.

This reply context presentation was modeled after idno as a way to get something working quickly.  Still very much in development.

== Brainstorming ==
=== reply to a photo ===
Mockup by {{aaronpk}} of how a reply-context in-reply-to a photo post could show a thumbnail of that photo:

[[File:example-reply-to-photo-showing-context.png]]
* Actual live post this mockup is based on: http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/30/3/
** Note: it's a reply to a post on instagram.com
* Reply to a photo-post on an indieweb site: http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/07/08/1/

== Silo Examples ==
=== Twitter profile page ===
'''2018-03-03:''' On profile pages, when you choose Tweets & Replies, the replies show a minimal reply-context in-stream:

[[File:twitter-in-stream-reply-context.png]]

=== Twitter home page ===
Twitter's home page shows <span id="In-Stream_Reply_Contexts">in-stream reply-contexts</span>.

As of 2018-03-05 or earlier:

Example of a retweet of a reply (possibly the only time you see replies in-stream on Twitter home stream)

[[File:2018-twitter-home-timeline-reply-context.png]]

Note all the info packed into this display:
* who retweeted
* reply author and dt-published
* reply-context
* reply content
* link-preview
* reply/retweet/like [[webactions]] with counts

Quote of a reply tweet example:

[[File:2018-twitter-home-timeline-quote-tweet-reply-context.png]]

Note the reply-context is inside the quoted box along with the rest of the quoted reply.

'''2013-08-29 Update:''' As of today Twitter in-stream reply-contexts have gone live:
* https://about.twitter.com/products/conversations

----

Starting 2013-06-03 (and ending sometime before 2013-07-23) it appears that [[Twitter]] (for some subset of users) was showing reply contexts for @-replies even when the replies are displayed *inline* in a stream!

[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context.png]]

If the tweet being replied to is itself a reply to another tweet that is the start of the thread, all three are shown:

From 2013-06-03..2013-06-05:
[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context-tweets.png]]

As of 2013-06-06 (and ending sometime before 2013-07-23) there was a vertical ellipsis and a "View conversation" link that goes to the permalink of the tweet of the start of the thread:
[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context-tweets-2013-157.png]]<br/>
"[https://twitter.com/neb/status/342430698080174082 View conversation]" - live copy of hyperlink in screenshots example.

Twitter collapses a longer threaded reply-context down to the start of the thread, a "View n more tweets" link, the tweet that's being replied to, and finally, the @-reply itself:

[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context-thread.png]]

"[https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/342301180820611072 View 3 more tweets]" goes to the permalink of the start of the thread, it does not expand it in-place. Seems like reasonable behavior.

As of 2013-05-27, Twitter is using this reply context UI within email <s>notifications</s> spam:

[[File:twitter-email-reply-context.png]]

* I find the constant flips in the directionality of time on twitter.com confusing. First swapping from feed -> permalink page, now there are mini reversed feeds *within* the main feed — is it just me or is it not always obvious (especially in long conversations) which direction the conversation is moving in? --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 09:22, 5 June 2013 (PDT)
** There is definitely a context-switch that happens. Not as jarring to me but consistency would be good. --[[User:Kartikprabhu.com|Kartik Prabhu]] 23:30, 30 April 2014 (CDT)
