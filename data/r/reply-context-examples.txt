__TOC__
'''<dfn>reply context examples</dfn>''' are real-world examples of [[reply-contexts]] on both indieweb sites and [[silos]], how they are presented, their visual design, UI, both on permalinks and in-stream.

== Add Examples ==
Please add examples!

If you support [[reply-context]]s on your site, please take a screenshot of a particularly good example (the nicer looking the better, though any example is good), upload it to the wiki, and add a subsection for yourself in the "IndieWeb Examples" section below.

If you see a nice reply-context design on a silo, take a screenshot of it, upload it, and document it in the Silo Examples section. It's ok to document multiple examples per silo as sometimes they change their UI over time and it's helpful to see what design iterations they've gone through.

=== Aaron Parecki ===
[[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] uses [[p3k]] which shows reply-contexts for replies on aaronparecki.com:
==== reply to a note ====
Reply context with original post text (auto-linked), dt-published (linked to original post permalink), author name/photo/URL:

[[File:example-reply-showing-context-aaronpk.png|link=http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/19/2/indieweb]]

* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/19/2/indieweb
* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/25/1/indieweb-qs

==== reply to a deleted note ====
* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/05/17/1/ is a reply to a tweet which was later deleted. Instead the reply-context shows and links to the IRC log of the deleted tweet.

==== multireplies ====
IndieWeb examples of displaying a [[multiple-reply|reply to multiple]] other posts

=== Barnaby Walters ===
On waterpigs.co.uk:

Reply context with original post text (@-names auto-linked), dt-published (displayed as relative time, and linked to original post permalink), author name/photo (both linked to author URL)

=== Sandeep Shetty ===
On sandeep.io:

Reply context with original post text (using the site-wide consistent blockquote convention for quoting external content), author name (linked to  author URL) and link to original post permalink. I used to also show  dt-published and author photo (similar to this like-context: http://indiewebcamp.com/File:sandeep.io-like-example.png) but [http://www.sandeep.io/56 redesigned] it to [http://www.sandeep.io/90 emphasize content].

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
Example on werd.io, using [[idno]]'s reply context presentation:

Reply context is shown with a "reply" arrow/icon, followed with the text "Replied to a post on ", then the domain of the original post, e.g. "bret.io", and finally a colon ":", where "a post on {domain}:" is hyperlinked to the URL of the original post. This feature was introduced on June 24, 2013.

[[File:Screen_Shot_2013-07-23_at_3.10.29_PM.png|link=http://werd.io/view/51c921fcbed7de745b274ae6]]

Multiple reply contexts are also possible:
[[File:idno_multiple_reply_contexts.png|link=http://werd.io/view/51f01e17bed7de2b1d060400]]

=== Bret.io ===
Reply context is shown with a "reply" arrow/icon, followed with the text "Replied to a post on ", then the domain of the original post, e.g. "werd.io", and finally a colon ":", where "a post on {domain}:" is hyperlinked to the URL of the original post.

This reply context presentation was modeled after idno as a way to get something working quickly.  Still very much in development.

=== Kartik Prabhu ===

(as of 2014-04-30) Reply context shows a "In reply to" caption followed by a list of hyperlinked urls of the original post.

[[File:KP-reply-context.jpg|500px|link=http://kartikprabhu.com/notes/disappearing-ny-book]]

=== gRegor Morrill ===
As of 2015-12-26, reply context shows the author photo, author name, author URL, original post link, and plaintext content. Examples:
* http://gregorlove.com/2015/07/solution-or-go-home-couldnt/ <br/>[[File:gregorlove-reply-context-2015-12-26.png]]
* reply to a public tweet: http://gregorlove.com/2015/12/and-thanks-for-all-the/
* reply to a private tweet: http://gregorlove.com/2015/12/girlvsplanet-thanks/

'''Previously:'''
As of 2014-06-25, reply context shows "In reply to a [post on domain]," with "post on domain" being a link to the original post.

Example from http://gregorlove.com/notes/2014/06/26/1/

=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} uses [[Red Wind]] to show reply contexts on [https://kylewm.com/ kylewm.com] replies to others' [[notes]] since 2014-10-16 '''(needs permalink and preferably earlier/earliest example)''':

[[File:kylewm-reply-context-2014-10-16.png|border|500px]] 

And photo reply contexts on replies to others' [[photos]] since (at least?) [https://kylewm.com/2014/05/i-used-to-live-in-bernal-heights-when-i-lived-in-the-city-looks-like 2014-05-07]:

=== Greg ===
[[User:unrelenting.technology|Greg]] displays photos in reply contexts, from https://unrelenting.technology/replies/2017-01-06-17-05-01

== Brainstorming ==
=== reply to a photo ===
Mockup by {{aaronpk}} of how a reply-context in-reply-to a photo post could show a thumbnail of that photo:

[[File:example-reply-to-photo-showing-context.png]]
* Actual live post this mockup is based on: http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/04/30/3/
** Note: it's a reply to a post on instagram.com
* Reply to a photo-post on an indieweb site: http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/07/08/1/

== Silo Examples ==

=== Twitter home page ===
Twitter's home page shows <span id="In-Stream_Reply_Contexts">in-stream reply-contexts</span>.

'''2018-03-03 update:''' For quite some time Twitter has abandoned the more extensive in-stream contexts, and provides only a simple in-stream reply-context:

'''2013-08-29 Update:''' As of today Twitter in-stream reply-contexts have gone live:

----

Starting 2013-06-03 (and ending sometime before 2013-07-23) it appears that [[Twitter]] (for some subset of users) was showing reply contexts for @-replies even when the replies are displayed *inline* in a stream!

[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context.png]]

If the tweet being replied to is itself a reply to another tweet that is the start of the thread, all three are shown:

From 2013-06-03..2013-06-05:
[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context-tweets.png]]

As of 2013-06-06 (and ending sometime before 2013-07-23) there was a vertical ellipsis and a "View conversation" link that goes to the permalink of the tweet of the start of the thread:
[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context-tweets-2013-157.png]]<br/>
"[https://twitter.com/neb/status/342430698080174082 View conversation]" - live copy of hyperlink in screenshots example.

Twitter collapses a longer threaded reply-context down to the start of the thread, a "View n more tweets" link, the tweet that's being replied to, and finally, the @-reply itself:

[[File:twitter-home-in-stream-reply-context-thread.png]]

"[https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/342301180820611072 View 3 more tweets]" goes to the permalink of the start of the thread, it does not expand it in-place. Seems like reasonable behavior.

As of 2013-05-27, Twitter is using this reply context UI within email <s>notifications</s> spam:

[[File:twitter-email-reply-context.png]]

* I find the constant flips in the directionality of time on twitter.com confusing. First swapping from feed -> permalink page, now there are mini reversed feeds *within* the main feed â€” is it just me or is it not always obvious (especially in long conversations) which direction the conversation is moving in? --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 09:22, 5 June 2013 (PDT)
** There is definitely a context-switch that happens. Not as jarring to me but consistency would be good. --[[User:Kartikprabhu.com|Kartik Prabhu]] 23:30, 30 April 2014 (CDT)
