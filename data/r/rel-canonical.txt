{{stub}}

'''<dfn>rel=canonical</dfn>''' is a way to indicate that a hyperlink links to the original and canonical version of the current page.

Compare rel=canonical with [[rel=alternate]].

== Why ==
You should use rel=canonical to reduce, minimize, and ideally eliminate any duplicate search results for your pages, i.e. you should canonicalize the following variants of your [[homepage]] and [[permalinks]]:
* with ?[[utm_]]* params -> without
* http -> [[https]]

== How to ==
Put a link rel=canonical in the head of your homepage and permalinks pages, e.g.:

<blockquote><code>&lt;link rel=canonical href="<nowiki>https://you.example.com/permalink</nowiki>" /&gt;</code></blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has had rel=canonical support for a while from his [[homepage]] and [[permalinks]] to their plain versions without any "?" query, and for the permalinks with the explicit URL slug. On 2019-272 he added support for http: pages to link rel-canonical explicitly to the [[https]] version of the URL so that [[Google Search]] and other search engines would prefer the https versions and avoid duplicate indexing of permalinks.
