{{stub}}

'''<dfn>related events</dfn>''' is a section on an [[event]] permalink page that shows mini versions of events [[related]] to that event, often with minimal UI to [[RSVP]].

== Why ==
There are many reasons why users may find events related to the current event useful:
* Additional events in a series (e.g. subsequent [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups)
* Events hosted by the same organization (e.g. [[IndieWebCamps]])
* Events with similar topics
* Events immediately before or after the current event in the same venue

== How ==
...

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
Update 2016-03-29:
* Top right text link is ALL CAPS "SEE MORE"
* confirmations now stay (no longer brief)
* GONE: fade and replaced by another event

As of 2016-03-08:

[[Facebook]] events, e.g. https://www.facebook.com/events/1688323548049648/ typically show a "RELATED EVENTS" box in the right column:

Note the minimal [[RSVP]] links for "Interested" and "Going" underneath each of these events.

If you click one of the RSVP links, the mini event is overlaid with a brief confirmation (during which you have a moment to "Invite Friends" or "Share")

Then fades slowly and is replaced by another event!
