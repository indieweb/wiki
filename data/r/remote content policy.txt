{{stub}}

'''<dfn>remote content policy</dfn>''' is a form of [[disclosure]] by a site about how it may treat content received ([[federated]]) from other sites, like how it may by default treat messages from other sites with URLs, from new remote accounts, with images or video, and/or from known abusive sites. Example: https://info.pleroma.site/federation.html See Also: [[disclosure]].
