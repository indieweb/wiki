{{stub}}

'''<dfn>remote content policy</dfn>''' is a form of [[disclosure]] by a site about how it may treat content received ([[federated]]) from other sites, like how it may by default treat messages from other sites with URLs, from new remote accounts, with images or video, and/or from known abusive sites.
* Counterpart: [[display-guidelines]] â€” how you express your preferences about how '''your''' content is displayed on other sites.
__TOC__
== Origin ==
The phrase "remote content policy" originates from a now dead page: <nowiki>https://info.pleroma.site/federation.html</nowiki>
* https://web.archive.org/web/20190406015604/https://info.pleroma.site/federation.html

== Alternative names ==
Since the original phrase only had a single source which is now defunct, it seems reasonable to consider a more user-centered/friendly name per IndieWeb [[principles]]. Feel free to list an alternative and contribute your opinion on existing suggestions.
