A '''<dfn>reply chain</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>reply thread</dfn>) is a list of [[replies]], and replies to those replies, displayed under the original post.

== Indieweb Examples ==
=== {{acegiak}} ===
* 2015-05-?? began re-sending webmentions for a post when it receives a comment.

=== {{kylewm}} ===
* 2015-06-09 supporting downstream comments
** [[Red Wind]] re-sends webmentions for a post when it receives a comment.
** also parses "p-comment" on incoming replies and interprets them as downstream replies (they look just like first-order replies in my UI).

=== {{benthatmustbeme}} ===
* 2015-10-16 supporting reading and display of downstream comments but intentionally only goes one level down.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
* {{chrisaldrich}} makes clever use of permalink URLs with fragments to thread conversations between Twitter and WordPress: https://boffosocko.com/2018/07/02/threaded-conversations-between-wordpress-and-twitter/
* He does something similar for other platforms which support [[Webmention]]

== Why ==
* ... to see all replies

== Receiving downstream comments ==

On 2015-02-19, {{acegiak}} proposed a mechanism for propagating a reply-to-a-reply upstream, back to the original post[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-02-19/line/1424397064095].

The mechanism works like this:

# Aaron writes a note
# Barnaby replies to the note and sends a webmention to Aaron
# Aaron parses the reply, and adds it as a comment on his note
# Crystal replies to Barnaby's reply, sends a webmention to Barnaby
# Barnaby parses Crystal's reply, adds it as a comment on his reply
# Since Barnaby's post is itself a reply, he in turn sends a webmention to Aaron's original post, letting him know the reply has updated.
# Aaron checks Barnaby's reply for updates as usual, and sees that Barnaby's reply now has a comment
# Aaron parses the comment and interprets it as a 2nd level comment on the original post.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Twitter ===
* An example of reply chaining on [[Twitter]]: https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/490958867803537408
* Twitter also clusters related replies together in its visual design from https://twitter.com/craigmod/status/623506782267305984 (Screenshot on 2015-07-21) [[File:twitter-reply-cluster.jpg|300px]]
