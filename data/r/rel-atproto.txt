'''<dfn>rel-atproto</dfn>''' is a [[rel|link relation]] that can be added to your [[rel-me]] links to indicate that this link is an [[ATProto]] account handle and an authentication option in [[RelMeAuth]].

== How ==
=== How to publish ===
For site publishers who want to link to an [[ATProto]] profile 

Add <code>rel="me atproto"</code> to the link to your ATProto profile URL:

<pre><a href="https://example.bsky.social" rel="me atproto">BlueSky</a></pre>

=== How to consume ===
{{section-stub}}
For sites who want to support consuming rel-atproto (AKA relying parties / RPs) for [[RelMeAuth]]

In your <code>[[rel-me|rel=me]]</code> consuming code:
* when parsing <code>rel</code> attribute values for <code>me</code>, keep track of all other rel values on each rel-me link.
* if any of those rel-me links has an additional rel value of <code>atproto</code>, then treat the link as an ATProto account handle and follow the [https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/oauth-client#authorization-flow ATProto OAuth guide]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [[indielogin.com]] has supported rel-atproto since October 2025:
<blockquote>
you can link to your BlueSky handle from your website, similar to how you would link to a GitHub or other external profile

<cite>https://indielogin.com/setup#atproto</cite>
</blockquote>
