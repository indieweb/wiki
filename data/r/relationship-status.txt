'''<dfn>relationship status</dfn>''' is a profile feature popularized by [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]] silos that allows users to indicate on whether they are in a (presumably romantic) relationship and optionally with who.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Martijn van der Ven ===
As part of his “Facebook should not contain more information about me than my own homepage” plan, {{martijnvdven}} added his relationship status to his [[h-card]] on http://vanderven.se/martijn/ during [[2017|IndieWebSummit 2017]] (2017-06-25).

The data is marked up as a <code>relationship-status</code> property on the microformats object.

== Silo Examples ==
More example likely available on http://microformats.org/wiki/relationship-status

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has a relationship status feature that has gone through several iterations, and was notable for their addition of "It's complicated".

=== Previously ===
==== MySpace ====
When [[MySpace]] still had social profiles, it had at least the ability to indicate whether not you were in a relationship.

== Brainstorming ==
{{veganstraightedge}} How should we markup our "'''relationship status'''" in our bios? For example,

  Shane Becker is ''in a relationship'' with Anneke Hiatt.

I'm thinking something like this:

* Shane Becker : .h-card.p-name[rel-me]
* "in a relationship" : .p-relationship-status
* Anneke Hiatt : .h-card.p-name[rel-sweetheart]

Is there already research around this? 
Is there already a proposed or defined spec?

Somehow, I missed the microformats wiki-page about this:
