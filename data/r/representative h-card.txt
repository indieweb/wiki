The '''<dfn>representative h-card</dfn>''' for a page is an h-card on that page that represents that page, if any, as not all pages are about a person or organization, a page might not have a representative h-card.

* For more info see: http://microformats.org/wiki/representative-hcard and read with translating hCard to h-card inline as you read.

== Use Cases ==
* How to discover a person's name and image from their [[homepage]] URL, e.g.:
** When [[creating]] a blog post, link to a person, and have that link automatically use their image and name as link text.
** After signing in with [[indieauth]], finding the person's name and profile image

=== How To Publish ===
See:
* how to publish: http://microformats.org/wiki/representative-h-card-authoring

==== How To Publish With WordPress ====
* '''Twenty Fifteen / Twenty Fourteen theme'''
** If you are using the Twenty Fifteen or Twenty Fourteen theme as a single-author site, you can edit the theme file <code>/twentyfifteen/inc/template-tags.php</code> or <code>/twentyfourteen/inc/template-tags.php</code>
*** Search for the line with <code>author vcard</code>
*** On the same line, find the link <code>a class="url fn n"</code>
*** Add <code>rel="me"</code> to that link, so it looks like: <code>a class="url fn n" rel="me"</code>
*** Save the template file

==== Test ====
* Indiewebify.me has [https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-card/ a test that validates representative h-card].

=== How To Discover ===
Either:
* Implement: http://microformats.org/wiki/representative-h-card-parsing
OR:
# Use a [[microformats2]] parser to parse the page / site homepage into JSON
# Process that JSON with https://github.com/indieweb/representative-h-card-php which will return a small JSON structure with the representative h-card for the page 

== Consumers ==
* [[Telegraph]] checks the URL of the person who logged in for a representative h-card to show their name and photo when logged in
* The [https://github.com/matthiasott/webmention Webmention plugin for Craft CMS] uses this to find the author during webmention processing
* ''...Please add examples of tools/services that consume it for their normal operation!''

== Libraries ==
* https://github.com/indieweb/representative-h-card-php - Given a parsed mf2 document, returns the representative h-card for the page
* https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth-client-php - When a user logs in, this library uses the [https://github.com/indieweb/representative-h-card-php representative-h-card-php] library to also return a representative h-card of the user
* [[IndieWeb_Utils|IndieWeb Utils]] implements the representative h-card algorithm. [https://indieweb-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery.html#get-a-representative-h-card View the docs for reference].
