{{stub}}

'''<dfn>reactions</dfn>''' refer to the subset of [[responses]]/[[interactions]] with a [[post]] that are quicker, more impulsive, but still a conscious act, typically a simple UI gesture without writing any content, such as [[like]]s ([[reacji]]), [[repost]]s, [[bookmark]]s, or perhaps multiple simple UI gestures, such as selection a text range and posting a [[quotation]] of part of a post, or picking a person from a list to post an [[invitation]] as a response to seeing an [[event]].

== Chat ==

Chat tools that support emoji reactions to messages:

=== Open Source ===

* Zulip
* Element
* Rocket.Chat

=== Silos ===

* Slack - has had custom emoji support at least since 2015, but could they be added as metadata or just typed in messages?
* Discord - Nitro required to add emojis from other servers

== Social Networks ==

=== Silo Examples ===
==== Facebook ====
[[Facebook]] supports:
* [[repost]]s (as "Share")
* simple [[bookmark]]s (as "Save post" or "Save link")
* expanded [[like]] reacji: 👍❤️😆😮😢😠 (more: [[reacji#Facebook]])

Facebook also refers to their reacji as "reactions":

=== The Tapestries ===
On [[The Tapestries]], reactions include Like, Agree, Disagree, and various emoticons and emoji like <3 and :zap:

== Premium Emoji ==

Streaming platforms including Twitch and Facebook have emojis that can be added for subscribers

== FAQ ==
* {{npdoty}} asks "is a citation a reaction"?
** {{t}} IMO no, since a citation usually implies considered inclusion and reference to support a specific point being made, rather than being impulsive.

** "I’ve been studying nonreactivity in buddhism. It’s one of the tactics of the path and also a goal. Today I noticed that Twitter and Facebook are built around literally giving a voice to your reactivity. Blogs were too, but they weren’t as effective."
