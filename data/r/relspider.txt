'''<dfn>[https://github.com/voxpelli/relspider relspider]</dfn>''' is a web crawler that indexes the identity/social graph of profiles.

The project was created by {{Template:voxpelli}} to crawl identities using [[rel-me]] links. It's focused on the ''identity graph'' subset of the [[social graph]] and on enabling similar queries on that subset as the Google Social Graph once did.

It started out as an experiment at [[Flattr]] to resolve [[verified]] ownership of web pages in an open, non-hands on way by linking [[authorship]] and [[identity]] to known verified ones such as the Flattr profile and connected third party ones like Twitter. When a link could be found a Flattr micro-donation to an author of some page on the internet could then be securely forwarded to the correct Flattr user without any kind of pre-registration of the content with Flattr. Unfortunately that project was never launched.
