{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-author rel-author]</dfn>''' is a microformat for linking a page to a URL representing an author of that page, a brief (similar to [[OGP]]) way to indicate [[authorship]].

For the broader discussion, examples, how tos etc. for indicating and discovering the author of a page, see:
* [[authorship]]

== How to ==
You can use <code>rel=author</code> on both <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements on pages written by an author (e.g. post permalinks, feeds like [[h-feed]]).

Simple link in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> like [[OGP]] meta tags, to an author’s site:
<pre>
<link rel="author" href="https://tantek.com/" />
</pre>
If your site also supports [[WebSub]], you can use the same <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element for the <code>self</code> relation as well:
<pre>
<link rel="author self" href="https://tantek.com/" />
</pre>

Or for a link to an author’s profile on a multi-author site:
<pre>
<link rel="author" href="https://fedi.example.com/@username" />
</pre>

== Questions ==
=== How can I verify the author ===
See: [[authorship-spec#Spoofing]].

=== Can you combine rel author with h-card ===
'''Q:''' What is the meaning of the combination of <code>rel="author"</code> with <code>class="p-author h-card"</code> as a one-line authorship inside an h-entry?

Example:
<pre><a href="/" class="p-author h-card author-icon" rel="author" title="Tantek Çelik"><img src="../logo.jpg" alt="Tantek Çelik"></a></pre>

It's not clear to me why <code>rel="author"</code> is used in this instance, but not in other, more verbose, h-card instances. Is the implication of the combination, "The h-card is found at this URL" instead of "This is the h-card"? So far I have interpreted the <code>class="p-author h-card"</code> to mean "This is the h-card." {{gRegor}}

'''A:''' <code>rel="author"</code> is for legacy parsers that only support rel-author + rel-me for determining authorship, and don't support h-card yet (e.g. Google spiders). It is easy enough to add the rel-author to one-line h-cards.

In more verbose h-cards, using rel-author would add complexity and the cost of that complexity is likely worse than ignoring legacy parsers. It's a trade-off, but the recommendation is to not use rel-author with more complex h-cards.
