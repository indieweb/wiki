{{stub}}

'''<dfn>rinsta</dfn>''' is a portmanteau for real [[Instagram]], a typically public account that conforms to Instagram posting conventions, like being highly curated, posting about once a day; since most IndieWeb sites are mostly public, some of this behavior may be similar. Contrast with [[finsta]].
