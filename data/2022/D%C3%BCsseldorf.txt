* Walk roughly North out of the train station and towards the right
* Carefully cross various local transit tracks & lanes
* Look for the building with a mostly caps/blue '''LiDL''' in bright yellow circle on blue square  <blockquote style="background:blue;display:inline-block;padding:0.3em"><span style="font-size:2em;color:blue;display:inline-block;background:yellow;border-radius:100%;padding:0.1em;font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;border:solid 0.1em red">L<span style="color:red;font-size:1.4em">i</span>DL</span></blockquote>
[[Image:2021-314-zentral-bibliothek.jpeg|240px|right]]
