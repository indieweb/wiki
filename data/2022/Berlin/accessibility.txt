There are some web information, that shows which places are accessible. [[OpenStreetMap]] does have accessibility information is a lot of their entries. But because of their policies concerning the data, they can no import any sources with their own demands, even if it is just a mention. 

So some other places combine the Open Street Map data with out sources. An example of this is [https://accessibility.cloud/ accessibility.cloud].
