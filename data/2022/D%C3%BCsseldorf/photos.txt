== Notes ==
* Session is about presentation, not storage.
* Instagram used to be instantly taken and shared photos, but has changed over the years
* Where do you share your photos? On your own site, but other places too?

* Tantek shows: https://tantek.com/2020/023/t6/cater-vegan-by-default-environment
** multiple photo's in one post (popularized by instagram)
** very long description
** still: the photo is the main subject of the post
** the syndicated versions are different
*** Twitter shows two photos and the beginning of the text
*** the Alt text of the photos are syncidated as well thanks to /Bridgy
**** The reply to this post has a preview, which starts with the Alt text, not the description (good usecase for alt-texts)

* {{gwg}} shows posts on his site, as a list with thumbnails. Also has a grid / masonary layout on his /kind/photo/ page
* /photos on his site actually shows photos from all posts, not just photo posts...this includes photos from checkins with photo, etc.
** Also adds map and weather conditions to any photo posts.
*** you can add ?sloc_units=metrics to show celsius instead of Fahrenheit
** Writes captions himself, locations are automatic
** has 'previous photo' and 'next photo'

* {{jkphl}} on the tollwerk website: https://tollwerk.de/blog/island-2020-auf-ins-abenteuer/
** gathers photo's of everyone who was on the trip (but text notes are there too)
** used a progressive web app to save photos (there was not always internet on Iceland, so it would upload when you got back online)
*** nice example of a good 'why' you want to do photos (this was to share with coworkers who stayed behind)
** it was not part of the social media strategy, was only on the site
*** this was meant to be something permanent, so put in on own site first
*** "I am really, really bad at Instagram"
*** Shows the human side of the company

* {{sebsel}}
** has photos in a grid on /fotos
** photos are wider than note-posts

* [https://buerfeind.de/ Ingo] has photography on his site
** makes pages on his site, but webhoster does not have that kind of capacity, so hosts his photos on Flickr.
** no social integrations because of GDPR, no preloads of tweets etc, only a link that works when you press on it
