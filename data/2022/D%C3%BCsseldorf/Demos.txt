* goes back a couple years, needs to migrate older content
* each photo links to the post it came from
* added [[Mastodon]] profile link

=== Unknown 1 ===
* '''did not catch the name of this person, please update if you know'''
* geofencing not working due to limitations on the phone, not running in background
* set up indiewebcamp posters that can be printed, including QR code
* after a certain time, might want to update content on the final URL you scan, or redirect it

=== Tantek ===
* {{t}}, https://tantek.com
* shows his interface for posting
* shows a preview of a [[reply]] to {{calumryan}}'s photo from yesterday
* added some more debugging. Adds `?d` parameter and shows lots of info
* debug shows it's a reply post without a Twitter in-reply-to or @-names, so shouldn't POSSE to Twitter
* only wants to make comment on Calum's post, not POSSE to Twitter
* previously all replies were going to Twitter, even if it didn't make sense
* debug shows the webmention endpoint discovered
* clicks "Publish Reply", live demo!
** looks like it still POSSEd to Twitter
* refreshes Calum's photo post and the reply shows up
* previously was having issues sending webmentions for RSVPs
