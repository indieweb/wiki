Many examples each year teach us, how important it is to own your data. Yet there is still a lot of work to do to help people to understand what “owning your data” actually means at all and how to get started. Interested? We're meeting for a two-day bar camp like collaboration in Düsseldorf again. Brainstorming, working, teaching, helping and much more. Join in on '''Saturday, April 30th and Sunday, May 1st''' and get your ideas out of your head and your hands dirty.

So, what is planned for the two days?

'''Day one, 30 April''' is giving you an introduction to this topic and is a day with discussions in a bar camp like environment. Bring a topic you'd like to discuss or join on topics as they are added to the board.

'''Day two, 1 May''' is all about implementing what you discussed. Work in groups with others or simply on your own. Demos at the end of the day show what everyone worked on and has achieved.

Both days are free to attend and we are happy that '''CGI Next''' give us a home for this event as well as they are sponsoring the catering for the two days.
