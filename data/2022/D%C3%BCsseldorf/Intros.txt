== Intro ==
Good morning!

We're starting IWC DUS2022 and we're watching this Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTSEr0cRJY8

tantek welcomes everyone to the seventh IWC DÃ¼sseldorf

introduces the wiki and the code of conduct

the Code of Conduct of the IndieWeb as well as that of Beyond Tellerand

tantek explained the name tags and the photo policy

now explains our Etherpad: you can follow the links on the wiki to get the them, and collaborate there

tantek now shows a tweet with a lot of replies to the question: do you have a personal website?

thanks to our host CGI

The tweet tantek showed: https://twitter.com/fox/status/1512293042467717120

@Loqi [@fox] if youâ€™re in tech, do you have a personal website? bonus points for why. ðŸ˜‡ (https://twitter.com/_/status/1512293042467717120)

tantek: IndieWebCamp is two days... first one is introductions, demos and discussions.

the second one is a create day, where you create things, might be sparked from those discussions

question: must your site be in this 90s style?

answer: no, it can be any personal site

== Tantek ==
tantek uses his site tantek.com as a replacement for social media

explains the barcamp / unconference style: participants will come up with ideas for sessions, we will vote on which ones to hold, and then we'll have them in a schedule to follow them

there will be lunch provided by CGI (thanks!)

lunch will be followed by a group photo and more sessions

day two is a great day to start with a personal site, if you don't have one

(tip: get your domain today, so DNS can propagate and be ready tomorrow)
