== Notes ==
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401 -- "This status code is similar to the 403 Forbidden status code, except that in situations resulting in this  status code, user authentication can allow access to the resource."
** This came up in discussing whether an IndieAuth client_id URL response should still be processed when the response is a 4xx. (401 vs 403 in particular)
* Discussion of one server implementing several IndieWeb building blocks together reminded {{martymcguire}} of http://www.flong.com/archive/projects/free-universal-construction-kit/index.html

=== display people icons ===
Should you always display the full resolution icons of people of posts you reply to? e.g. in the [[reply-context]]? 

People should be able to consent to their photos and other content being shared on other sites. If my site receives a webmention from your site, I should conservatively not re-host your content (e.g. your photo) unless you have given me explicit permission. ...but, how is best to give permission? Should consent be given in the process of sending a webmention, or should the content be marked up with licenses?

See: https://sebastiangreger.net/2018/05/indieweb-privacy-challenge-webmentions-backfeeds-gdpr/
* Specifically the section: The initial solution: anonymizing “not intentionally submitted” feedback
* https://sebastiangreger.net/media/pages/2018/05/indieweb-privacy-challenge-webmentions-backfeeds-gdpr/269a9bb3f7-1561589134/indieweb-privacy-pixelated-1000x.png
* backfeed is one of the primary use-cases of this, where people replying/liking/reposting have no idea that they will show up on another website

== things built ==
* {{t}}: 
** /fta link — use-case: txting a link to someone so they can call me via FaceTime Audio (using my own domain as my identity, not a phone number)
** tools to debug my home page but not *at* my home page in production, e.g. an /index-new (not a real path) instead of having to live deploy/test at my main home page at /.
** fixed my home page [[photo grid]]! and added a bunch more testing, staging, and debugging capabilities for my home page and composite stream
** updated home page events listing!

** researched land acknowledgments and created a wiki page https://indieweb.org/land_acknowledgment

** Example at https://www.kevinmarks.com/memex.html
** somewhat like https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/ and http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/about-federated-wiki, but ideally mroe dynamic and using webmention

* {{jacobhall}}
** Here is my work-in-progress design https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rdz1_udV0ijyLXYXpc-WSz_y_vUYggKWEpCgUyERvJ0/edit#slide=id.gfc625f989b_0_4

*** redirect HTTP -> HTTPS via 308
** got composite stream on homepage consisting of (notes, rsvps, photos)
