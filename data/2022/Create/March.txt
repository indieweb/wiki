== Participants and Plans ==
{{gwg}}
* Continue with project to own bookmarks
* Test Site - wpdev.gwg.us
* Thoughts on Ticket Auth implementation possibilities...Dumped to TIcket Auth on wiki.
** Alice has a feed containing public and private posts. By default, fetching it only returns the public posts. You need a token/auth to get everything. Alice decides she wants her friend Bob to get the entire feed. So, her site sends a ticket to Bob's ticket endpoint, which redeems it for a token that can access the feed. How does Alice know to send Bob the ticket? Either, solely because Bob is her friend(unsolicited) or because she monitors who is subscribed to her feed somehow and wants to offer him the enhanced version. Assuming Bob's feed reader is tightly integrated with his site and ticket endpoint, if it gets a ticket for something it subscribes to, it should automatically start fetching the feed with the token to get the enhanced version. Alternatively, if Bob doesn't subscribe to Alice's feed already, his site can decide if it wants to fetch it and put it in a special Microsub channel for unsolicited invitations, a moderation flow, etc.
** Alice has a single private post. She wants to share it with Bob. So her site sends a ticket to Bob's ticket endpoint. Bob can then redeem it and decide what to do with the subject...the same option as for a feed above.
** Alice has an h-card that contains private elements. She wants Bob to have the enhanced version. She sends a ticket to Bob, and Bob's site redeems it, identifies it as an h-card, and updates/enhances his nickname cache with the information.
** Carol has decided to send a ticket for everyone who logs into her website and will decide what that token can unlock specifically later on
