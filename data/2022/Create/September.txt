Does anyone who posts [[bookmark]] or [[read]] articles have their system save the content from the article that they have read for future references (in addition to say, sending it to the Internet Archive), and does your system do this from your server or your client? E.g.
* https://www.ft.com/content/3851ddff-09f3-4832-a800-eb69d50c0113 is viewable in my browser (via Google News, this https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEN1Hi1_IqHDyfz4vvZSnZmkqGAgEKg8IACoHCAow-4fWBzD4z0gw_fCpBg?uo=CAUiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzM4NTFkZGZmLTA5ZjMtNDgzMi1hODAwLWViNjlkNTBjMDExM9IBAA&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen should redirect to that article), but the Internet Archive version shows just a [[login wall]], as does going directly to the FT URL.

* This is a good practice, for anyone who posts [[bookmark]] or [[read]] posts, to privately archive the contents of the thing that they read. This relateds to [[IndieArchive]]
