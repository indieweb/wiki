<span class="p-summary description">'''<dfn class="p-name summary">IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2022</dfn>''' are stand-alone single topic sessions originally started in 2020, partly in response to the coronavirus pandemic that prevented the long history of regularly occurring in-person camps in various cities.</span>
