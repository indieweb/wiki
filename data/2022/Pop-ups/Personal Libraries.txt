'''<dfn>Personal Libraries</dfn>''' was a [[2022/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2022]] session focused on the design and use of personal websites with relation to displaying one's books online, status updates about reading, and generally talking about books in a Goodreads-like social media manner.

== Details  ==
We'll focus discussion on [[personal library|personal libraries]] on one's site and how they can interact with each other. How can we pool data and resources for the common good? How can we provide [[Goodreads]] like functionality in a decentralized manner? What pieces are we missing? How can we add them? Are there any easy ways we can standardize the pieces for better site to site interoperability? How can we interoperate with other projects like [[Mastodon]] and [[BookWyrm]] or data sources like [[Open Library]]?  See also [[personal_library#Decentralized_Goodreads_Experiments]]

=== Introduction ===
==== Code of Conduct ====
https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct

<blockquote>Be respectful of other people. Respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.</blockquote>

*Photography Policy* - please don't take screenshots without prior notice to participants. Before we officially begin, we'll do a large group photo for those who'd like to participate. 

The sessions will be recorded with audio and video, so please leave your camera/microphone off or on as you feel comfortable. We'll do our best to add "voices" from those communicating via chat, Etherpad, and other channels into the conversation so that those who wish to stay muted or off camera can still participate.

=== Session Proposals ===
See also: https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attending#Session_Scheduling for format/ideas 

Sessions are the heart of a camp. 

Unlike traditional conference formats BarCamps have a self-organizing character, relying on the passion and the responsibility of the participants. Attendees schedule sessions typically by writing on a large Post-It note or piece of paper and then placing them on a 'grid' of sessions by timeslot and conference room or space. 
Session proposals typically contain the following: 
    
*  A descriptive title
** A facilitator name for a session (almost always the person proposing the session)
**  A longer description about what might be discussed, brainstormed, or researched during a particular session
** A unique short hashtag that will be used to create an etherpad and other possible related resources for a session

Below are some potential sample topics we might consider. Feel free to flesh one out or propose your own either in advance of the event or on the morning of. We'll schedule them after the introduction that day.
