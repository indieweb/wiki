'''<dfn>Analog meets Online</dfn>''' is an [[2022/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2022]] session.

How do the fun and potential of our personal websites, and the connection of online community, extend into our offline lives and spaces? How are people playing with the boundaries of virtual and offline life? How can websites enhance physical places, things and events?

Let's share our analog-virtual projects and ideas (and examples you've seen), explore what excites us about the future, discuss how online and in-person community and events interface and enhance each other, and reflect on bigger picture questions about the blending of these spheres in our lives and society.

All are welcome!

=== Interest ===
Those who expressed interest in the session during planning:
* {{jamesgoca}} would love to see this event, especially given his thermal printer projects (https://search.jamesg.blog/results?query=thermal%20printer) from earlier this year.
* +1 {{maxwelljoslyn}} - I'm hoping to eventually set up a "cockpit" display panel which uses LEDs, etc to show me the result of queries like "has created a post within last 2 days" and other possible metrics measured/generated by my site.
* +1 {{petermolnar}} - I've experienced working online communities as extensions or precursors to IRL events in the 2000s and I'd love if that would redevelop in this decade\
* +1 {{gwg}} - I'm always free. Except when I'm not.
* +1 {{j12t}}
* +1 {{chrisaldrich}} The 2022-01-22 date works for me
* +1 {{t}} love this idea and the topics mentioned! Will try to make whatever date is decided (would prefer to avoid weekends though if possible)
* +1 {{sknebel}}

== Pre-Planning ==
* ...
<!-- Hide this (at least until after the session is over) 
How do our personal websites connect with and relate to IRL experiences? How are people playing with the boundaries of virtual and offline life? How can websites enhance physical places and things and events? Is there a role for analog interactions between websites? How do in person meetups fit in with building online community? How does knowing something will be documented online affect in person experiences? Should we try to bring the two spaces together (augmented reality?) or is it better to keep them distinct? (Throwing lots of ideas out there to see if anything sticks!)
