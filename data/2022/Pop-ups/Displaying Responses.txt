'''<dfn>Displaying Reponses</dfn>''' is an upcoming [[2022/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2022]] session.

Incorporating aesthetics and functionality for displaying responses and quotes from other sites on our websites. (Less about the technical how-to, more about interpersonal considerations and user-friendly styling.) We could also discuss the "should we" side of backfeed, which has come up in chat recently.

=== Session One: Homepage Mentions ===
* {{campegg}} -- homepage mention feels equivalent to @mention on Twitter
* {{gwg}} -- may want to decide how to display on a case by case basis -- lots of use cases
* may want to convert some homepage mentions to posts

==== Possible display locations for different types of homepage mentions ====
Sorts of responses which might be sent to homepages as mentions, but which could be moved to alternate pages
* "ask me anything" (AMA) page
** https://boffosocko.com/about/ama/
* endorsements page might be an option
* [[portfolio]] 
* testimonials
* Mentions page
** {{chrisaldrich}} uses this as his default storage/display location for homepage mentions
** https://boffosocko.com/mentions/
* FAQs
** responses on a page like this actually provide evidence it's actually an FAQ
* "Followed by" page -- social proof
** example https://boffosocko.com/about/followers/
* Guestbook page
* Pokes, "Yo" page - aggregates pokes
** example: https://jamesg.blog/webmentions/2021-10-19-351
* Invites - invitations to particular events
* Note to self page (theoretical, does anyone have examples of this? or do they keep a to do list on their site for personal productivity?)
** could collect reminders from yourself
* Wall (Facebook prior art)
** does anyone have a "wall" on their site?

''' Questions and prior art '''
* {{angelo}} -- do we differentiate based on the type of incoming mention? (e.g. blogroll with rel, h-entry)
* Bridgy converts @mentions to homepage mention
* "Follow of" posts -- social media sites all show follows / following
* Sending mentions to different pages provides context, adds meaning 
** {{chrisaldrich}} manually moves posts to appropriate pages (see list above)
* {{capjamesg}} -- would like to see homepage mentions like 'notifications'
* may want to indicate to readers where people can see mentions of homepage
* {{gwg}} -- most homepage mentions received have been check-ins, tags, generic mentions
* another possible type of person-tagging: live mentions, like at events

* What is person-tagging etiquette?
* How does one navigate this in a public social commons?
* person-tagging with microformats

==== Person Mention Brainstorming ====
* https://indieweb.org/person_mention

If the receiving page is an h-card or a author....then
*  if the target link to your home page is a u-invitee link, then you've been invited to the event linked to by the in-reply-to of that h-entry
* someone tagged you in their (source) post, if the target link to your home page is a u-category link. 
** unless the containing h-entry has a u-tag-of link, in which case the source is merely tagging you in a different post, the post that the u-tag-of links to.

{{gwg}} added...

* if it is marked up a reply - then it's a message to the person represented by the h-card. 
* if it marked up as a review - then it is a review/endorsement of the person

==== Collaborative posts / multi-author posts ====
* collaborative posts -- how would a webmention work? if it's syndicated, would webmentions on one version get sent to both versions? 
* would co-author be an @mention? then they could reply with a 'co-signed' indication
** is that a good use of webmentions? 

==== Blogroll / "Following" ====
* {{chrisaldrich}} -- do people have an idea of who is following us? 
* {{capjamesg}} -- following is a snapshot in time 
* {{gwg}} For blogroll discovery, how about h-feed of u-follow-of h-card?
** u-follow-of - I am following
** u-follow - I am being followed by
* {{capjamesg}} pointed out that to aid in discovery, we might need a rel attribute, e.g. rel='following','follow-list', etc.  to indicate a follow list. Or some other option. (Rel=follow might be mistaken for something else)

==== Additional info that could be shared / displayed ====
* similar to the thinking / doing / feeling pattern
* post some contextual information about you when you were making the reply
* to {{chrisaldrich}}'s point about sharing location context when you send a reply
