'''<dfn>Displaying Reponses</dfn>''' is an upcoming [[2022/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2022]] session.

Incorporating aesthetics and functionality for displaying responses and quotes from other sites on our websites. (Less about the technical how-to, more about interpersonal considerations and user-friendly styling.) We could also discuss the "should we" side of backfeed, which has come up in chat recently.

=== Session One: Homepage Mentions ===
* similar to the thinking / doing / feeling pattern
* post some contextual information about you when you were making the reply
* to Chris' point about sharing location context when you send a reply 

==== Person Mention Brainstorming ====
* https://indieweb.org/person_mention

If the receiving page is an h-card or a author....then
*  if the target link to your home page is a u-invitee link, then you've been invited to the event linked to by the in-reply-to of that h-entry
* someone tagged you in their (source) post, if the target link to your home page is a u-category link. 
** unless the containing h-entry has a u-tag-of link, in which case the source is merely tagging you in a different post, the post that the u-tag-of links to.

{{gwg}} added...

* if it is marked up a reply - then it's a message to the person represented by the h-card. 
* if it marked up as a review - then it is a review/endorsement of the person
