'''<dfn>Displaying Reponses</dfn>''' is an upcoming [[2022/Pop-ups|IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2022]] session.

Incorporating aesthetics and functionality for displaying responses and quotes from other sites on our websites. (Less about the technical how-to, more about interpersonal considerations and user-friendly styling.) We could also discuss the "should we" side of backfeed, which has come up in chat recently.
