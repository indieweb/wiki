== Notes ==
=== Introductions===

=== Discussion ===
* [[webring|Webrings]] were a way to discover new sites without search engines
* What questions do you have about making the IndieWeb more approachable?
** add your questions here ...
** can you create a knowlwedge graph using microformats? do you need SPARQL or is there something simpler (I found https://waterpigs.co.uk/articles/consuming-microformats/, nevermind)
** ask in the chat about this! we don't have a page on knowledge graphs but we should -- i love knowledge graphs!

* document problem points for people new to the IndieWeb - what jargon comes up?
** more organized, structured getting started indieweb wiki (easy win) 
** indiewebify.me is great but i just found it, maybe should be linked to from wiki

* there are some specific wants
** requirements you have in mind that you want your website to meet (technology, how you can represent posts, amount of maintenance required)

* validators
** [[indiewebify.me]]

==== Pain Points ====

* personal pain point (ender): so much coding to do and i become a perfectionist
* choice
* what domain name do I want? what do I build my site with? what plugins do I use? - lots of questions to answers and decisions to make.
** kate compton's casual creator paper explains why restricting choices can improve creativity
** "what really are my choices?" - a big question for beginners
** when joining mastodon: which instance should I join?
** that's after you get past the question "what's an instance"
** ^^ i listened to a podcast where the hosts said they just gave up on mastodon because it was too complex
* what do all of the building blocks do?
** idea: create a visual page that explains them all?
** ^^ great idea, visual explanations are special

* A progression? orality, literacy, coderacy...
* can we have a multi-path experience on our website
* no technical experience, want something that just works
* willing to do a bit of coding
* happy to get in the weeds
* (ender I'd love your thoughts on this!)
* ^^ i think this is a great idea! and explaining the pros and cons of each approach (ender)
* different tracks let people see what's possible with the technical details, rather than just starting from there

* There is some work at helping to direct people of different levels to the quickest solutions: [[2021/homepage]] 
** use a three-column view that shows different paths

*The best way to eat a whale is one bite at a time. Michelle seems to have eaten half a whale in one big bite in the past week. :) 
** which is maybe due to our docs - we introduce too many things at once?

* Ender made a great point about doing what you find fun / interesting

* A good opening question for people who are first joining the IndieWeb without a site: what do you want your site to do?

Should we make the chat more prominent on our home page? There are lots of people -- from those in the weeds with the technologies to those who like our principles -- who are active in there!
* yes, in my opinion. I have been on the wiki and had no idea there was a chat
** this is very good feedback
** join us today Ender! [[discuss]]  <- thanks!
** (all of the chats are connected so everyone sees the same messages no matter what platform you use)

Another resources for getting started quickly for the absolute beginner: [[Quick_Start]]

Should we make a #indieweb-getting-started channel in our chat - a place that's about basic questions without talking about too many details.
* Assumed knowledge: we need to make sure beginner discussions in chat don't require background knowledge.
** we want to encourage experimentation + building + thinking!
** maybe a GitHub template that deployes your site to sitename.github.io and has a great CMS - turnkey to begin with but also allows for progressively more programming already exists(mostly)
*** [[Getting_Started#GitHub_Pages_&_GitLab_Pages]]
What content for beginners do we have that could be made more prominent?

Give people [[sparklines]] automatically?

Handwriting websites: [[handwriting]]
* a single question in chat often leads to a wiki page being created / updated as we all learn!

* Create a graph that shows your wiki contributions!
** https://sparkline.jamesg.blog/?username=Jamesg.blog&api_url=https://indieweb.org/wiki/api.php&only_image=true&days=30
** Replace "jamesg.blog" with your wiki username!
** NB: This is case sensitive!

* What would Tantek do?
** A few good questions to ask yourself to frame a problem
** [[WWTD]]

* What is the web vs. the IndieWeb? - how do we make this easier for people to understand?
