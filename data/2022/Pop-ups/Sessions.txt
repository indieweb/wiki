https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Sessions

If you're interested in hosting a pop-up session, feel free to use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

If you instead want to see a session happen or want someone else to host a session on a topic, please bring it up in IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] and see if you can find someone interested to host (and have them add it to the wiki instead of you).

The session planning/development progresses on this page, by trying to get a core group of individuals who advise availability and interest, with sufficient time for others to join as well.

Once you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]]. See our guidance for [[Pop-up Organizing|organizing pop-ups]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for the future.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2021_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.

== Microformats Roundtable ==
Let's work through and discuss some of the open Microformats issue trackers. The proposal is to schedule 60, 90, or 120 minutes at a regular interval, either every month, every other month, or every 3 months, so we can finally address some of the long-standing microformats issues we have in the community. If we choose an alternating schedule, we can have different people from our various timezones each time.

Proposed:
* Name: Microformats Popup: Microformats2 Issues Resolution Session
* Description: (draft, feel free to edit/improve) <blockquote><p>Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.</p><p>Let's discuss how we can close out some outstanding microformats2 issues.</p><p>This is an intermediate session, with a prerequisite of basic knowledge of HTML and microformats. Experience with publishing and/or parsing is a plus. All are welcome.</p><p>More details will be posted over time</p></blockquote>

== Pipes ==

[[pipes]] are a way of providing some value-add for IndieWeb tools that are useful as part of some other service. Let's discuss some of the existing services, as well as brainstorm some alternatives that we as a community want to go after.

== InDWeb ==

Using [[dweb|DWeb]] tech on the IndieWeb. How can one leverage Tor/IPFS/Hypercore/Braid(OT/CRDT) on their website today? Also, a crash course of IW building blocks for people coming from the DWeb and an appeal to cross-pollinate by prototyping from your own site.

Add your +1 for interest in this topic:
* {{jacky}} - I'm currently working to make [[Koype]] a DWeb-first as well as IndieWeb-first site (around [[Hypercore]] for now), so I'm down to talk shop
* {{maxwelljoslyn}} - I'm hugely into Braid. I want to use it to enable cross-site goblin invasions. Count me ''in'' times 100.
* +0 {{t}} - here to help cross-pollinate, and reality check, e.g.
** IPSF is a [[hashweb]], not a "DWeb" in any user-centric meaningful way

== Personal Site Search ==
How can personal websites leverage search to provide a better experience to their users? What are the benefits and tradeoffs of deferring site search to an external provider like Google or DuckDuckGo versus building one's own personal search engine? What features should a personal search engine have? These are questions we would like to discuss in the Personal Site Search Pop Up.

This session is a place for anyone who owns a personal site, or who is interested in personal sites, to come and discuss web search in the context of their site.

== Organizers ==
To discuss how we will decide to restart in-person events, reflect on how the online only model has worked for us, and other outstanding [[organizers]] issues.

Not sure if this is for you? See [[Organizers]] for a brief description of who is an IndieWeb organizer (changes every year!)

== Revisiting [[2012/Positive_Arguments]] and the idea of self-expression ==
Many of the reasons we share to join the IndieWeb are negative, focused on why the corporate web is bad. In 2021, people are mostly aware of the problems with corporate sites, but may see no other option. How could the perspective shift to focus on the many positive attributes of the IndieWeb instead? 

The goal of the session would be to discuss which parts of a [[2012/Positive_Arguments|2012 discussion about positive arguments for the IndieWeb]] are still relevant, which might have gone stale, and if there's anything missing, add it, while making the page into a bit nicer to read.

Another aspect of the discussion could be that "self expression" is completely missing from the wiki. In my opinion, what made the internet such a wonderful place in the 90s and 2000s was the possibility to make a completely custom representation of one's self, including colours, imagery, everything. The epitome of this was probably Flash, the most popular of it was MySpace profiles, and I'm starting to believe that we're losing this from the web.

* {{tracydurnell}} - interested in this from a marketing perspective, and maybe talking about whether / how self-expression and the "weird web" connect with a DIY / handmade ethos (webpunk?) and aesthetic 
* {{gwg}}
* {{binyamin}} - It's entirely possible to shift perspective, within the current set of arguments. Similar to Tracy, I'd like to see about improving <abbr title="Public Relations">PR</abbr> for the IndieWeb.
