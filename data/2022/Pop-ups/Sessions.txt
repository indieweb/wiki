https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Sessions

If you're interested in hosting a pop-up session, feel free to use this page to brainstorm or flesh out your event(s), or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org/indieweb/ IndieWeb chat]. 

If you instead want to see a session happen or want someone else to host a session on a topic, please bring it up in IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] and see if you can find someone interested to host (and have them add it to the wiki instead of you).

The session planning/development progresses on this page, by trying to get a core group of individuals who advise availability and interest, with sufficient time for others to join as well.

Once you confirm a date, please create an event on [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/popup events.indieweb.org] with the tag "popup", and create a page for session notes on the wiki, for example [[2020/Pop-ups/GettingStartedWithWordPress]]. See our guidance for [[Pop-up Organizing|organizing pop-ups]].

There is also a [https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-up/Sessions#Prior_Hold_Overs list of potential sessions that were held over in 2020] which may make interesting sessions for the future.

An incomplete list of holidays and other [https://indieweb.org/Planning#Nearby_2021_Events nearby events can be found on the planning page] to help prevent scheduling conflicts.

== Microformats Roundtable ==
Let's work through and discuss some of the open Microformats issue trackers. The proposal is to schedule 60, 90, or 120 minutes at a regular interval, either every month, every other month, or every 3 months, so we can finally address some of the long-standing microformats issues we have in the community. If we choose an alternating schedule, we can have different people from our various timezones each time.

Proposed:
* Name: Microformats Popup: Microformats2 Issues Resolution Session
* Description: (draft, feel free to edit/improve) <blockquote><p>Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.</p><p>Let's discuss how we can close out some outstanding microformats2 issues.</p><p>This is an intermediate session, with a prerequisite of basic knowledge of HTML and microformats. Experience with publishing and/or parsing is a plus. All are welcome.</p><p>More details will be posted over time</p></blockquote>

=== Prerequisites ===

At the [[2020/Pop-ups/Microformats]] session, there were several takeaways that would be good to resolve before trying another session. Specifically,

* what are the requirements / is the process to iterate on a Proposed property?
* what are the requirements / is the process to iterate on a Draft property?
* explicit lists of steps to follow to add a proposed property (with example "what specific real world use-cases they are solving, preferably with a link to a step-by-step user scenario, e.g. demonstratable using existing non-standard / single-site / single-implementation tools"), and transition a property from proposed to draft to core

If we do not at least have a detailed proposal on this to discuss, then any discussion of stabilization will not be successful.

== Pipes ==

There are a number of common pieces of functionality that are shared across IndieWeb services, such as a means to provide [[reply-context|/reply-context]]. This is used to facilitate bridging in some cases.

We can do this using i.e. a shared Python library, but it leads to be language-specific, and can't be used for folks in different tech stacks.

Instead, we can provide common HTTP-based services - perhaps backed by these shared libraries - to provide language-agnostic tools.

These services are [[pipes]], and during this pop-up, let's discuss some of the existing services, as well as brainstorm some alternatives that we as a community want to go after.

== InDWeb ==

Using [[dweb|DWeb]] tech on the IndieWeb. How can one leverage Tor/IPFS/Hypercore/Braid(OT/CRDT) on their website today? Also, a crash course of IW building blocks for people coming from the DWeb and an appeal to cross-pollinate by prototyping from your own site.

== Personal Site Search ==
How can personal websites leverage search to provide a better experience to their users? What are the benefits and tradeoffs of deferring site search to an external provider like Google or DuckDuckGo versus building one's own personal search engine? What features should a personal search engine have? These are questions we would like to discuss in the Personal Site Search Pop Up.

This session is a place for anyone who owns a personal site, or who is interested in personal sites, to come and discuss web search in the context of their site.

== How to Make the IndieWeb More Accessible ==

The IndieWeb community welcomes anyone who is interested in expressing themselves on a personal website, regardless of technical experience. With that said, our current website architecture and homepage may not be appealing to those who do not have a technical background and are looking to start a personal website.

The goal of this session is to discuss, document, and share ideas on: (i) can we create "paths" on our website or elsewhere that give tactical guides to getting set up based on different levels of intent; (ii) what alternate mediums can we use to share knowledge about the IndieWeb (i.e. video); (iii) how can we discuss the IndieWeb with people we know who might be interested (in the same vein, what are our key value propositions).

This pop up is an opportunity for all community members to express their thoughts on how we can make the IndieWeb more accessible and approachable. We can use the outcome of this pop up to better inform  community initiatives (i.e. a homepage redesign) and spur new ideas that may attract new people or help welcome and nurture existing members.

== Positive Arguments ==
Many reasons we share to join the IndieWeb are negative, focused on why the corporate web is bad. In 2021, a lot of people are aware of the problems with corporate sites, but may see no other option, so could a perspective shift to focus on the positive attributes of the IndieWeb encourage more to join? 

The goal of the session would be to discuss which parts of a [[2012/Positive_Arguments|2012 discussion about positive arguments for the IndieWeb]] are still relevant, which might have gone stale, and if there's anything missing, add it, while making the page into a bit nicer to read. Additionally I'd like to add the topic of "self expression" is essentially missing from the wiki. We're in 2022, and communities like [https://yesterweb.org/ Yesterweb] are gaining a lot of traction, because they focus on the same aspects as what made the web a hobby in the 90s and the early 2000s: freedom of (artistic) expression, having a home on the net, a custom representation of one's self. The epitome of this was probably Flash, the most popular of it was MySpace profiles, and I'm starting to believe that we're losing this from the web, and it was never a strong point in IndieWeb.

== Meta Gardening / Collective Community Science Online ==
Looking at the big picture of the personal website / blog ecosystem: what is made possible with our websites en masse? What could our websites contribute? There are community science apps and websites people can contribute to, is there an IndieWeb way to participate? It can be hard to find useful gardening information and learn from others' experience and wisdom. 
* ways to collate observational data from many websites for scientific use? 
* using microformats to mark up observational data and gardening info (e.g. companion planting)
* collecting microclimate data corresponding to natural phenomena (phenology) - is this useful if collected in a standardized format by many bloggers in many places? is this useful to track for climate change? 
* how can we track our own gardening info in a way that's useful for ourselves, and others? (e.g. varieties, timing, companion planting, style of gardening, etc. to make planting decisions easier next year)
* ways to exchange gardening advice on our websites

== Personal websites as productivity tools ==
How can, and do, people use their websites as productivity tools or to increase their effectiveness? What systems and processes do people use to get the most out of their site? 

Types of productivity and personal growth people probably use their websites for:
* Tracking - quantified self
* Task management - replacement for apps? 
* Learning / knowledge management - digital gardens
* Accountability - personal reviews

== IndieWeb and Activism ==
How does IndieWeb fit into political activism, resistance, and counterculture? On social media, it's become common to share messages about social justice and participate in 'events' like changing your profile picture to showcase support for a movement. How are people using their websites now to write about or support causes? What benefits could a distributed communication model offer organizers? What challenges and risks does website-based activism face?

== Sending the Golden Ticket: TicketAuth Delivery ==
The needed extension to [[IndieAuth]] to allow people to get per-user access to resources on our site is here. The extension doesn't explicit say how one could go about this and how one could build up such a system for their own use (or for the use of others). This popup is an attempt to collect ideas from the community on how implementors and users of TicketAuth could go about making it work. Current and previous idea include the following:

* after someone [[follow|follows you]],
* to whomever sends you a [[webmention|Webmention]],
* people within your [[nickname-cache|address book]]
* ... add some ideas ...


Hat tip to {{GWG}} for the golden ticket term during [https://events.indieweb.org/2022/07/homebrew-website-club-pacific-WIG10sPyslvv HWC 2022-07-06].
