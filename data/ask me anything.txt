'''<dfn>ask me anything</dfn>''' or '''<abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr>''' is a public facing page which allows people to ask questions online they'd like the originator to answer.

A common variation of this is also known as <abbr title="Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything">AMAA</abbr> for "Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything". A common feature of such pages/service providers is often the ability to ask questions anonymously.
