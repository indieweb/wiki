'''<dfn>practical solution</dfn>''' is often to go with the easiest solution.

The practical solution depends on what problem you’re trying to solve :
* If it’s how to markup your data on a web page, then [[microformats]] is easiest and already widely supported
* If it's how to notify another website that you’ve linked to it, then [[webmention]]
etc.
