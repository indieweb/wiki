== Changes ==
Collections can change over time but typically don't change often. Changes to collections typically consist of additions, rarely is something removed from a collection. Things may be added to the collection in a specific location within the collection, since the order of the items in the collection is significant.

Changes might be reflected by update posts, e.g. the photos that have been added to a set or notification of a correction to a post.

== Different from a feed ==
[[feed|Feeds]] are typically automatically-generated sets of date-ordered posts where the set changes often, new posts showing up at the top of the feed, and old posts dropping off.
