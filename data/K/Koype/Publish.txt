=== Why no support for (Like|Repost|Bookmark)? ===

I ({{JackyAlcine}}) am taking an opinionated approach and leaving actions like the ones mentioned below for a [[reader]] to use. I don't see the case for micro-interactions like these since they don't focus on original content but the act of sharing it. The only exception to this is [[reply|direct replies]].

* [[like]]
* [[bookmark]]
* [[repost]]
* [[read]]
* [[listen]]

== Formats ==

Koype Publish will be able to support direct HTML, HTML generated in the browser, plain text and Markdown.

* [[Koype]]
* [[Micropub]]
