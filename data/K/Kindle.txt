'''<dfn>Kindle</dfn>''' is [[Amazon]]'s [[book]] [[silo]] service and hardware e-reader devices for viewing those books. They utilize a number of proprietary file types including .mobi, .azw, .tpz, and others that often include [[DRM]] protection  and prevent books from being transferred easily from one device to another or from being converted to other file types.


== Data Export ==
Book files can often be exported directly from most devices by connecting them directly to a computer.

=== Highlights and Annotations ===
These are typically kept in a file named <code>clippings.txt</code> which is a simple text file with the [[highlight]]s and [[annotation]]s along with date and timestamps.

Highlights and annotations are also synced to Amazon's site at https://read.amazon.com/notebook and if one has a linked [[Goodreads]] account, they will be mirrored at https://www.goodreads.com/notes/.

Several services offer alternate means for extracting some Kindle data:
* [https://www.clippings.io/ Clippings.io] offers a paid service that exports Kindle annotations in a variety of formats.

* [[Calibre]] offers an import data tool

* [[diigo]] is a bookmarking service that offers methods to export Kindle annotation data [https://blog.diigo.com/2017/08/22/introduce-a-new-way-to-retain-knowledge-from-books/ Introduce a new way to retain knowledge from Kindle books] by Joel Liu

* [https://readwise.io/ Readwise] Will allow you to sync your Kindle, iBooks, and Instapaper highlights and review them. 
** [https://readwise.io/bookcision Bookcision] provides a [[bookmarklet]] that allows export of annotations by book from Kindle in plain text, XML, and JSON formats.
