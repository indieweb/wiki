'''<dfn>Klout</dfn>''' was a social rating service based on having users sign-in to a few silos like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], [[LinkedIn]], and analyzing their total followers and subjects discussed across the silos, producing a single score up to 100 as a measure of social media influence. It shut down on 2018-05-25, likely coincident with [[GDPR]] being in effect.
