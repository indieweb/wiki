'''<dfn>[https://keyoxide.org/ Keyoxide]</dfn>''' is an open-source platform for creating and verifying "distributed online identities" using cryptographic signatures. It allows a person to provably link their online identities together across multiple platforms using [[OpenPGP]] and [[backlink|bidirectional linking]].

The Keybase web app can be self-hosted, and there is a CLI tool which can be run locally. Because identity claims are made on the user's own OpenPGP keys or via signed plain-text documents, the platform is stateless and does not store any user data.

The underlying technology is called "Decentralized OpenPGP Identity Proofs (DOIP)" and is being standardised in the [https://ariadne.id/ Ariadne spec].

Keyoxide is being developed by the [https://keytoidentity.foundation/ KeyToIdentity Foundation] led by Yarmo Mackenbach, and has been funded by [https://nlnet.nl/project/Keyoxide/ an NLNet grant].
