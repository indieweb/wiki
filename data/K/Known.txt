'''<dfn>[http://withknown.com Known]</dfn>''' is an open publishing / community platform [[project]]. It aims to be a simple, beautiful way to share your story using a variety of media from any device. It adheres to the IndieWeb [[building-blocks|technologies]] and [[principles]].
<br clear="both">
== Goals & Model ==

Known aims to be easy to install, use and customize. It adheres to IndieWeb [[building-blocks|technologies]] and [[principles]].

Known is  an open source project and a business. Known is transitioning from a private business entity to a business run as an [https://opencollective.com/known open collective]. 

Known users are encouraged to donate and support the collective.

The shared hosting business accounts are scheduled to be wound down by summer 2019. Known provided

* A managed SaaS service. Not accepting new users.
* Enterprise licenses.
* Support subscriptions.
* Customizations.

For directions on migrating see [http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/data_migration/ Known Documentation]  

[[User:werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] and [[User:erinjorichey.com|Erin Jo Richey]] founded Known, Inc as a seed-funded startup incubated at [http://matter.vc Matter Ventures]. It formally launched on September 11, 2014, and graduated from the Matter program.

== Releases ==

Known was released in September 2014. Packages can be downloaded from [http://withknown.com withknown.com].

The official release channel is now on [https://github.com/idno/known GitHub]

{{mapkyca}} also maintains a site for current releases at [https://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/known/]

== Development ==

Known was released at [http://withknown.com withknown.com] in September 2014. A paid fully-hosted version and a free self-hosted version was available. [https://withknown.com/guides/ Guides are available] for self-hosting on Arvixe and Reclaim.

Please note Reclaim Hosting stopped updating Known as of 0.9.2. The version is still available as a one button push in CPanel, but the instance must be manually updated using SFTP. 

withknown.com stated that they will help users to move to or from a self-hosted Known site and make sure all data are transferred. Users can also export all their site data.

Documentation is being updated at [http://docs.withknown.com docs.withknown.com].

=== Plugins & themes ===

Known has a full plugin architecture, making use of [[PHP]] lazy loading and the observer pattern. This makes it very easy to create new content types or behaviors.

Known is being developed with the rule that "indie" content - internal posts, likes, etc - are bundled as included plugins in the main source code repository. If you want to [[POSSE]] to external sites, you need to install those plugins separately (although they may also be included in a downloadable distribution of the content).

Currently, content includes:

* Posts ([[articles]])
* Status updates ([[notes]])
* [[Photos]] (images)
* [[Events plugin|Events]] ([[events]])
* [[Checkins]] (places)
* Chickens (chickens)
** Chickens were demonstrated at the [[2013]] camp but have not been made available as a plugin.

Supported [[webmention]] annotations include:

* [[Replies]]
* [[Likes]]
* Reshares
* [[RSVPs]]

Known also has a [[Webfinger]] endpoint that plugins can extend.

== How to ==
=== Install ===
See http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/

=== Hosts with one click installs ===
Sometimes it's easier to allow a host to install and maintain the codebase for one's [[CMS]]. The following hosts are known to have one click install capabilities for Known:
* [[Reclaim Hosting]]
* ...

=== Upgrade ===
To upgrade, copy the new Known installation files over the existing installation.  Known's core files can be safely overwritten.  It's '''always''' a good idea to perform a backup, both of the files and of the database before upgrading.

=== Setup Known on nginx ===
[http://elliottucker.net Elliot Tucker] has posted a full how-to here https://elliottucker.net/setting-up-known-with-nginx-indieweb.html Note - the source code change is no longer required and you can now also use Known with MySql.

{{kylewm}} tried unsuccessfully to reproduce reported issues with callbacks from Twitter and Facebook. Here is the configuration that worked for me https://gist.github.com/kylewm/7d8cbc9a72984d67c646

=== Use MongoDB ===
'''Note:''' As of 2017-05-15, the version 0.9.9 release has deprecated support for [[MongoDB]].[http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/changelog/]

Mongo is only used now if it's explicitly specified in the config.ini file, e.g.,

<code><pre>
database = 'Mongo'
filesystem = 'local'
uploadpath = '/var/www/data/'
</pre></code>

(of course replace /var/www/data with your chosen data directory)

* Note that {{benwerd}} recommends MySQL over MongoDB these days[http://werd.io/2014/thedavidjohnson-we-actually-recommend-mysql-known-started-with-mongodb-but]

=== Transition from WordPress ===
{{stub}}

{{davidmead}} is in the process of transitioning his personal site from WordPress to Known.

As Known works only on a domain or sub-domain at the moment, I had to create blog.davidjohnmead.com and install it to there. I didn't want to blow away [http://davidjohnmead.com my current WP blog] until the Known site was running, connected to the silos and able to import my WP content. I also have content on [http://davidmead.withknown.com davidmead.withknown.com] to pull in as that's where I'd been playing around with Known.

==== Steps from WordPress ====
* Created sub-domain on Media Temple of http://blog.davidjohnmead.com
* Created new FTP user
* Downloaded zipped ‘Dunham’ version from http://withknown.com
* Unzipped and put it in sub-domain's HTML folder
* Browsed to domain and saw the start up page
* Needed db info. Went back in to MT and created new MySQL for Known to use
* Entered info but something was wrong (fat fingers or Chrome  auto-fill) Had error on page. Back buttoning didn’t take me back to the form. Had to delete the config.ini and start again. '''Some better handling of this error would be great'''.
* Ended up editing the config.ini and FTP it up to the server. It works!
* Filled in profile, setting and site configuration
* Has nice step through on how & where to create the APIs to interact with the different social silos. A couple of the steps are a little out of synch, but I think that's more the silo's updating. Nothing you can't muddle through.
* Add rel="me" links from WP page to Known site for [https://indieauth.com/ IndieAuth]
* Go through social media and update the URL in my profiles with blog.davidjohnmead.com so [https://indieauth.com/ IndieAuth] and [https://www.brid.gy/ Brid.gy] work.

==== Issues moving from WordPress ====
* Encountered various errors on pages for plugin's, posting, and editing entries. Most have these have been fixed by {{benwerd}} updating GitHub and myself FTPing the files/folders to my server.

* Big issue around having curl errors after posting/editing certain content. See GitHub [https://github.com/idno/idno/issues/629 issue 629], [https://github.com/idno/idno/issues/635 issue 635], and [https://github.com/idno/idno/issues/630 issue 630]. Looks like there may be progress but if you are on a shared server (like myself) editing the apache config to get around the basedir issue cannot be done.

==== Next steps to move from WordPress ====
* Find a URL shortener for creating [[permalinks]]. Used the Hum plugin in WP.
* Set up CRON to back up Known site to Dropbox etc.

==== Issues moving from hosted Known site  ====
When Known was first released I started using it at [http://davidmead.withknown.com], posting over 240 pieces there for about 2 months. The export hasn't worked in the settings, so {{benwerd}} sent me the export.  This is an entities.sql file and the folders associated with my posts.
* I copied the folders containing my posts to the 'Uploads' folder on my server. I now have 2 sub-folders there: blog.davidjohnmead & davidmead.withknown.com
* I can import the entities.sql file into my current hosted Known blog (after backing it all up) using phpMyAdmin. No problems there. All the old entries merged with the new, and I could see them in phpMyAdmin, but none of the entries display on blog.davidjohnmead.com.

Looking at the [https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/734 Issue 734] on the Known GitHub, it seems there are a lot more hoops to jump through including changing imported URL's etc. Not as easy as I first thought.

=== Import from Flickr ===
To import your [[Flickr]] photos, use this Known plugin: 
* https://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/2019/01/20/new-known-flickr-import/

=== How to use Quill ===
To setup a Known instance so that you can use [[Quill]] to publish to it (this has not been extensively tested by the indieweb users as of now, and it seems that the /micropub endpoint is not fully working) :
* You may have to install the indiepub plugin: https://github.com/idno/indiepub 
* And then enable the micropub endpoint.

===How to use with Mobile===
For ideas on using Known for sharing on mobile see also [[Posting from mobile devices]]

=== How to use the API ===
See https://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/2015/05/28/using-the-known-api/ for a good API intro.

Idno/Pages/Admin/Users.php is the user administration endpoint, which translates to /admin/users as a URI endpoint.

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Fix 404 Not Found on /begin ===

This usually means .htaccess is missing or more often, not allowed, based on the Apache configuration. If you manually visit /index.php/begin instead and see a landing page, it means that htaccess is not being allowed to rewrite URLs.

At least in recent versions of Ubuntu, Apache is configured by default with ''AllowOverride Off''. To allow, create a new &lt;Directory> configuration in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf for your Known install, with ''AllowOverride All'', and restart Apache.

<code><pre>
<Directory /var/www/html>
         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
         AllowOverride All
         Require all granted
</Directory>
</pre></code> 

* Would a better sysadmin than me review this please! [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]

=== Plugins and Themes Missing ===

We're not sure what causes this yet, it should "just work". Some things to check:
* Check that your www-data user has read/execute permissions on the IdnoPlugins and Themes directories
* Try adding <code>path = /path/to/your/known/</code> in your config.ini
* The Apache error log may give some hints, e.g. <code>/var/log/apache2/error.log</code>.

Update: This seems to have been fixed in version 0.6.3

=== The target page does not exist ===
If you send a webmention to a Known install that runs behind a TLS offloader, e.g. with a curl command like:
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace"><nowiki>
curl -i -d "source=http://tantek.com/2015/017/f1&target=https://michielbdejong.com/2015/joining-the-indie-web-my-motivation-cc-by-michiel-de-jong" https://michielbdejong.com/webmention/
</nowiki></blockquote>

and get an HTTP error like: <samp>HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request</samp> with contents:
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace">
{"error":"target_not_found","error_text":"The target page does not exist."}
</blockquote>

A workaround for this is documented in https://github.com/idno/idno/issues/724

== Itches ==

=== Notifications ===

=== New content types ===

* Generic [[files|file]] uploads
* Self-contained [[HTML5]] widgets (eg, [[games]], or educational tutorials, or [[ebooks]])
* [[Audio]]
* [[Video]]
* [[Reviews]]
** See [[Reviews for Known]]

=== Countering spam ===

Some users of Known have seen a high frequency of spam submitted through the comment forms, and there are few possible ways to address this

==== Akismet plugin ====

mapkyca has created an Akismet plugin (https://github.com/mapkyca/KnownAkismet) for Known which will filter out spam on a Known install. It works very well, but has a few downsides:
* There's no UI to admin the plugin in Known, and mark false positives or vice versa
* The plugin can sometimes filter out legit webmentions to your site as well

==== Disabling public comments plugin ====

Another method is to disable the system plugin "Public Comments" which is part of the standard installation of Known. This will effectively block spam coming through the form on each entry, while allowing [[webmentions]] to come through. The downside is that you limit who can have a conversations with you, unless you have also syndicated your content to other platforms, where it can be pulled in by [[brid.gy]] for example.

=== IndieFriends ===

Known is designed to be a multi-user system (although Ben and Erin are currently using it as single-user sites). The intention, therefore, is to implement a traditional asymmetrical social networking friends / following model - with an IndieWeb spin.

* Each user will have a following page, with [[h-card|h-cards]] marked up using [[XFN]] links to each followed user's [[profile]].
* When User A starts following User B, an appropriate link is made on the following page. A [[webmention]] is sent with the source set to User A's following page, and the target set to User B's [[profile]] page.
* User B's system notifies User B, who can react accordingly.
* Ideally, this is then attached to a reader component. See below ...

In a future embodiment, each step in the webmention process could be signed on a per-user basis (I'm interested in [[HTTP signatures]], with keys exchanged / assigned at the point of mention. This would allow content to be made privately available to individual users. Other methods of retrieving private web content should also be considered.

=== Reader ===
Because it's not enough to publish: a way to _consume_ IndieWeb content from a Known user's followed sites and users.

=== Common Webmentions ===
[[Bridgy]] publish will POSSE your content if you include a webmention to a service-specific URL (e.g. `https://brid.gy/publish/facebook`).  It would be great to turn these into simple check-box options when you're publishing via Known.  (I'm curious what the interface looks like when you've plugged in their paid solution "Convoy")

== Criticism ==
=== HTTPS support ===
<strike>withknown.com doesn’t support [[https]] for browsing, during signup, or on anyone’s subdomain, meaning that authentication credentials and cookies can easily be intercepted on public wifi networks, as well as private content.</strike>
* The domain supports [[https]] for *.withknown.com domains. The next release of EFF HTTPSEverywhere will automatically redirect.

The hosted service now supports HTTPS by default for all *.withknown.com domains. Custom domains are... [http://werd.io/2015/why-the-secure-web-isnt-ready-for-primetime-but-we complicated]... but work is ongoing. Self hosted services are unaffected, and can be HTTPS or not at the owner's discretion.
