https://indieweb.org/Koype

'''<dfn><a href="https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next">Koype</a></dfn>''' is an open-source [[project]] that serves as an optimized headless [[Micropub]] server.

= Features =
Until Koype has its own website up and running (or if {{jacky}} chooses to use his own site to measure progress), this Wiki page will serve as a way to measure progress.

== Pagination ==
Koype makes use of different forms of [[pagination]], namely [[pagination#Date_Based_Pagination|date-based pagination]] and a form that sorts by a determined lexicographic order on a particular field.

* For date-based pagination, it'll take in any ISO8601/RFC3339 timestamp as a cursor and use that with <code>limit</code>, <code>offset</code> and other filters to walk over a time range.
** There's work to allow duration-centric values to be used in <code>limit</code> and <code>offset</code> as well.
* For lexicographic sorting, it'll internally pick a field based on the item's type and use that for sorting. This is mainly used for things like [[categories]] and [[syndication|syndication targets]]

== Available ==
* Aiming to be fully compliant with the [https://micropub.rocks Micropub test suite]
* Asynchronous [[Webmention]] sending with [[Vouch]] support
* Implementing [[Micropub-extensions|extensions]]
** [[Micropub-extensions#Slug|slug]]
** [[Micropub-brainstorming#syndication|syndication]]
*** [[Webmention]]-based
*** [[Micropub]]-based, [[syndication-brainstorming#Syndicate_by_Reference|by reference (planned)]]
** [[Micropub-extensions#Visibility|visibility]]
** [[Micropub-extensions#Destination|destination]]
* Flat file system with [[SQLite]] for indexing of data

=== Async [[reply context]] hydration ===
When a URL is encountered when creating a new post, Koype runs it through its set of URL transformers. Depending on the authority of a URL (here being the host name and port of a URL), Koype will attempt to fetch a normalized (formatted in MF2+JSON) representation of the URL. This is built to work with [[XRay]] and can work with any other tool that returns MF2+JSON either as the root object, under a specified key or returns an HTML page formatted with MF2 with an item that has a property named <code>url</code> that contains the URL to be parsed.

In the event that no MF2 can be resolved from the remote URL, OGP, Twitter Card and the HTML is parsed to a minimum viable constraint to permit it as a [[microformats|Microformat item]] usable as a reply context. The resulting parser approach is hinted in the <code>type</code> of the resulting object.

=== Async [[Webmention]] processing ===
Koype ''should'' be used with a [[Webmention#Publisher_Services|Webmention service]] that supports callbacks. That allows Koype to lean into a ''push-centric'' approach on collecting incoming Webmentions and parsing the result of outgoing Webmentions. If the callback hasn't been called within a configured set amount of time, Koype will fall back to fetching Webmentions for pages in regard to their last <code>q=source</code> request within a preconfigured interval. By default, if no incoming Webmention callback has been called in 12 hours, Webmentions for pages are fetched once every two hours (planned and tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/32).

== Planned ==

** [[Micropub-extensions#Audience|Audience]]
** [[Micropub-extensions#Contacts|Contacts]] —see more at [[#Address_Book]]

* Implementing [[microsyntax]] for plain-text regions (tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/46)

=== Address Book ===
Koype builds a [[nickname cache]] that's usable for quickly mentioning people in the system. It's available with authentication using the Micropub query <code>?q=contact</code>. There's also going to be logic to [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/55 automatically hydrate and update contacts using WebSub]

This is being tracked at https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype-next/issues/17.

== File System ==
Koype works on a ''virtual filesystem''. The long-term goal is to allow for it to write to object storage, come preloaded with a sample filesystem for demonstration purposes and simplifying backups. Koype works with an idea of ''resources'', a way to organize files on a filesystem. For example, all entries are bundled under a 'entries' resources, contacts under 'contacts', and so on. The following is an example of what the layout of files would look like:

538 directories, 592 files (truncated here on the Wiki)
</pre>

* The root directory name defaults to <code>./data</code> but can be put anywhere.
* Most resources are stored at <code>$ROOT/$RESOURCE_ROOT/$LOCAL_PATH</code> where <code>$LOCAL_PATH</code> is a string with <code>$CURRENT_YEAR/$CURRENT_MONTH/$RANDOM_ID_FIRST_TWO_CHARS/$RANDOM_ID_WHOLE</code> and <code>$RESOURCE_ROOT</code> represents the root path for a resource.
* The only 'special' resource is the database—it doesn't get its own directory.

== Database ==
[[SQLite]] is used to handle quick indexing. Koype implements a virtual table that picks up JSON information for entries on disk on every row access to allow for querying for anything that I've liked from a specific URL like:

<pre>
-- Load the module only available in-process.
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE epv USING MODULE entry_property_values();
-- Select any entries that use the provided URL.
SELECT
    uid
FROM epv, json_each(epv.properties, '$.like-of')
WHERE
    (
        -- nested item
        json_type(json_each.value) == 'object' AND
        (
          json_extract(json_each.value, '$.value') = :expected_link OR
          json_extract(json_each.value, '$.value') LIKE :expected_link
        )
    ) OR (
        -- nested image
        json_type(json_each.value) == 'object' AND
        (
            json_extract(json_each.value, '$.src') = :expected_link or
            json_extract(json_each.value, '$.alt') = :expected_link
        )
    ) OR (
        -- a string
        json_type(json_each.value) == 'text' AND
        json_each.value = :expected_link
    )
ORDER BY uid DESC LIMIT 3
</pre>
