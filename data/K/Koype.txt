'''<dfn>Koype</dfn>''' is an open-source [[project]] that aims to provide a one-stop shop for those looking for a single-tenant Web service to [[own-your-data]].

The project is currently still underway and an example of the single tenant site is available at [https://v2.jacky.wtf v2.jacky.wtf]. The source code is at [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/ git.jacky.wtf]. See [https://koype.net https://koype.net] for more information about the project. The design of the internal system is meant to adhere to the [https://brutalist-web.design/ brutalist Web design] philosophy.

== Initial Launch ==
For its first release (v0.1.0), Koype aims to have the following features:

* [[IndieAuth|self-hosted authentication via IndieAuth]]
* [[Micropub|self-hosted posts management via Micropub]]
* [[Webmentions|self-hosted web mention support via Webmentions]]
* [[Microsub|self-hosted subscription tooling via Microsub]]
* a dedicated page for [[following|simplifying the act of following page]]
* abstracted object storage support
* emit [[nodeinfo]] information

= Features =
Koype aims to ship with loads of IndieWeb specific features as well as some other protocols and standards that allow other platforms to interact with it. Despite having everything in it, it'll allow for external configuration pointing to allow for [[plurality]] of the [[building blocks]] used by Koype.

== Webmention Sending and Receiving ==
Status: [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/6|'''working on''']

Koype provides an internal system for processing and handling [[webmention|WebMentions]]. There's a dashboard to view incoming webmentions.

=== Sub Features ===

* Add listing/record of outgoing webmentions - currently visible on jobs page
* Searching by:
** source (incoming) domains
** source post types ([[reply]], [[like]] etc)
* Blocking by
** source domains (regex)
** source types (regex)
* Permitting a fixed list of types to be shown

== IndieAuth Provider ==
Status: [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/1|'shipped' (baseline)], [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/31|'backlog' (alt)]

Koype provides an in-built [[IndieAuth]] system for authenticating the site against remote services. It also provides support for swapping out the in-built system for a third-party service like [[IndieLogin]] or [[Fortress]].

== Address Book ==
Status: '''backlog'''

Koype allows for one to store [[h-card]] information about people in a lightweight fashion using [[Micropub]]. For ease of use, immediately searchable attributes are stored to the database. Everything else is stored to longer term storage (the object storage system). This makes it easy to look up people in the future and mention them when appropriate.

=== Sub Features ===

* Add contacts ([[h-card]]) information to groups ([[category]])

== Post Type ==
Koype has support for the following post types:

* [[h-entry]]
** [[note]]
** [[like]]
** [[reply]]
** [[repost]]
** [[bookmark]]
** [[photo]]
** [[video]]
** [[rsvp]]

=== Planned Post Types ===
The following are post types that are on the list of things to support but aren't being actively worked on as of yet.

* [[h-event]]
* [[h-review]]
* [[h-card]]

== Progress Log ==
=== 2018.10 ===
* 03: [[IndieAuth]] support has implemented with 100% coverage. Will fail aggressively if client application does not emit h-x-app or h-app information.
