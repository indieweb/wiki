'''<dfn>Koype</dfn>''' is an upcoming software project that aims to provide a one-stop shop for those looking for a single-tenant Web service to uphold IndieWeb principles.

The project is currently still underway and an example of the single tenant site is available at [https://nextgen.jacky.wtf nextgen.jacky.wtf]. The source code is at [https://git.jacky.wtf/me/next-gen-website/ git.jacky.wtf]

* [[IndieAuth|self-hosted authentication via IndieAuth]]
