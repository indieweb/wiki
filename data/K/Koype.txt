'''<dfn>Koype</dfn>''' is an open-source [[project]] that aims to provide a one-stop shop for those looking for a single-tenant Web service to [[own-your-data]].

The project is currently still underway and an example of the single tenant site is available at [https://v2.jacky.wtf v2.jacky.wtf]. The source code is at [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/ git.jacky.wtf]. See [https://koype.net https://koype.net] for more information about the project.

== Initial Launch ==
For its first release (v0.1.0), Koype aims to have the following features:

* ✓ [[IndieAuth|self-hosted authentication via IndieAuth]]
* ✓ [[Micropub|self-hosted posts management via Micropub]]
* ✓ [[Webmentions|self-hosted web mention support via Webmentions]]
* a dedicated page for [[following|simplifying the act of following page]]
* abstracted object storage support
* ✓ emit [[nodeinfo]] information
* ✓ support for a [[nickname-cache|nickname cache]]

= Features =
Koype aims to ship with loads of IndieWeb specific features as well as some other protocols and standards that allow other platforms to interact with it. Despite having everything in it, it'll allow for external configuration pointing to allow for [[plurality]] of the [[building blocks]] used by Koype.

== Private Posts ==
Status: [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/169 '''working on''']

[[private_posts|Private posts]] are intended to allow people to visit a instance of Koype and view content addressed to them. This would also involve sending [[webmention|WebMentions]] to sites that are addressed in the post as well.

=== Address List ===
An address list in Koype is an extension of the [[Koype#Address_Book|address book]] feature. People are represented using [[h-card]]s and can be put into multiple address lists. The HTML representation of said list would look something like this:

<pre>
<main class="h-feed">
  <h1 class="p-name">Avengers</h1>
  <p class="p-note">These are people I can trust to avenge us; whatever it takes.</p>
  <a class="h-card u-url" href="https://shield.mil/agents/black-widow">Natasha Romonov</a>
  <a class="h-card u-url" href="https://sword.mil/agents/marvel">Carol Danvers</a>
  <a class="h-card u-url" href="https://stark.com/staff/walters-jennifer">Jennifer Walters</a>
  <a class="h-card u-url" href="https://tony.stark">Anthony Edward Stark</a>
  <a class="h-card u-url" href="https://avengers.org/staff/rogers-steve">Stephen Rogers</a>
</main>
</pre>


=== Implementation Path ===
The route for implementation would be something like the following:

* Require that a user has been authenticated to the site (using [[IndieAuth]] or [[AutoAuth]])
** If not, give <code>401</code>
* Fetch list of addresses (cc'd folk) for a post
** Enumerate all users in remote resources
* Find authenticated user against list of addresses
** If authenticated user is not in 'any list', give <code>403</code>
** Else, show post!

== Webmention Sending and Receiving ==
Status: [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/6|'''working on''']

Koype provides an internal system for processing and handling [[webmention|WebMentions]]. There's a dashboard to view incoming webmentions.

=== Sub Features ===

* Add listing/record of outgoing webmentions - currently visible on jobs page
* Searching by:
** source (incoming) domains
** source post types ([[reply]], [[like]] etc)
* Blocking by
** source domains (regex)
** source types (regex)
* Permitting a fixed list of types to be shown

== IndieAuth Provider ==
Status: [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/1|'shipped' (baseline)], [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/koype/issues/31|'backlog' (alt)]

Koype provides an in-built [[IndieAuth]] system for authenticating the site against remote services. It also provides support for swapping out the in-built system for a third-party service like [[IndieLogin]] or [[Fortress]].

== Address Book ==
Status: '''in progress'''

Koype allows for one to store [[h-card]] information about people in a lightweight fashion using [[Micropub]]. For ease of use, immediately searchable attributes are stored to the database. Everything else is stored to longer term storage (the object storage system). This makes it easy to look up people in the future and mention them when appropriate.

=== Sub Features ===

* Add contacts ([[h-card]]) information to groups ([[category]])

* [[h-entry]]
** [[note]]
** [[like]]
** [[reply]]
** [[repost]]
** [[bookmark]]
** [[photo]]
** [[video]]
** [[rsvp]]

=== Planned Post Types ===

* [[h-review]]
* [[h-card]]
