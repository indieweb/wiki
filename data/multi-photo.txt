{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>multi-photo</dfn>''' is like a [[photo]] post, except just with multiple adjacent photos, either in a series, or tiled / arranged in some layout.

Not a multi-photo post:
* photos interspersed with narrative text, use an [[article]] instead.
* multiple photos paired with their captions, use a [[collection]] post
* someone else’s photos, use a [[repost]] instead, or at least wrap it in an [[h-cite]].
See [[#Instead_use|Instead use]] for more on posts similar to multi-photo posts.

== Why ==
Sometimes you might have several photos that seems like part of the same thing, and thus make sense when published all together, with a single description/caption.

== Instead use ==
There are many posts that have multiple photos or other images in them, despite that, they are not necessarily "multi-photo" posts, they are often something else.

=== article ===
If your photos are interspersed with text, especially narrative text, you're writing an article that happens to contain photos. Your post as a whole is not just a "multi-photo" post.
* Use [[article]] instead

Examples:
* https://snarfed.org/2003-11-20_were_not_in_kansas_any_more

=== collection ===
If your photos are specifically delimited by their own captions, e.g. photo1, caption1, photo2, caption2, etc. then you're essentially posting a collection of entire photo posts, since each photo(n) + caption(n) pairing is its own photo post.
* Use [[collection]] instead. Post each photo(n) + caption(n) as its own singular photo post at its own permalink, and include them all in a single [[collection]] post.

=== repost or cite ===
Especially for the above two cases, if you're posting photos which are not yours you should either
* Use [[repost]] to repost the permalink where the author of the photo published it themselves.
* OR if the author has no original, then cite (using [[h-cite]]) the photo as part of your post.
Otherwise if you just use <code>u-photo</code> directly yourself to embed someone else's photos or artwork, since you're the author of your post you're implying they're <em>your</em> photos, that you photographed them or drew them which is kind of like plagiarism.

== How ==
Like a photo post, but with multiple "u-photo" images.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] to publish multi-photo posts [http://tantek.com/2015/352/t1/building-lights-clouds-heels-cab since 2015-352] which are [[note]] posts with embedded images at the start. He does the following:
# Uses [[Instagram]] iOS client to post photos there
# Writes & posts a [[note]] on his own site that starts with a direct .jpg URL of the photo image, then a space/linebreak, then permalink of the Instagram post, then at least one more .jpg URL + permalink, then caption.
# That "note" is auto-upgraded by [[CASSIS]]'s <code>auto_link</code> function into a multi-photo post by putting the <code>u-photo</code> class name on the [[auto-embed]] <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> of the JPG, since it's the first URL in the "note", and auto-linking it with the subsequent URL, then including any immediately subsequent JPG+URL pairs into additional <code>u-photo</code> embeds.
# Falcon automatically uses [[Bridgy]] Publish to [[POSSE]] the multi-photo as a photo post to both [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] (thought currently only the first u-photo), saving the resulting syndication URLs in storage.
* multi-photo: http://tantek.com/2015/352/t1/building-lights-clouds-heels-cab
** has two photos
** only first was POSSEd via Bridgy Publish to Twitter and Facebook
* with person-tags: http://tantek.com/2015/352/t2/freedom-tower-np-nyc-winter
** though none of the person-tags made it through

== Silo Examples ==
=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] users frequently post collage images of multiple photos, often enough that Instagram even built their own separate app, ”Layout”, to help with the creation of these collage images (which are multi-photo posts arranged into a square or rectangle).

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] added support for posting multiple (up to 4) photos in a single tweet (when?)
* ... URLs to examples of multi-photo tweets needed!
