'''<dfn>Leaders Summits</dfn>''' are half-day events for everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] or was active organizing [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups in the past two years. (Due to the spread-out nature of our community, many attend remotely).

== next ==
The participants in the [[2017/Leaders|2017 Leaders summit]] (before [[2017|IWS]]) decided that more frequent (than yearly) Leaders Summits could be beneficial.

The next IndieWeb Summit will be mid-[[2018]], and it's very likely we'll have a Leaders Summit the Friday morning before the Summit.

If you're [[planning]] an IndieWebCamp between now and the next summit, and want to organize a Leaders Summit beforehand, drop a heads-up here linking to your IndieWebCamp's planning page with details about a proposed Leaders Summit.

* [[Code of Conduct]] One of the pieces missing from it is an ombudsmanish contact/enforcement mechanism or a means of helping to resolve issues. Usually at Camps we mention up front who to contact or converse with privately if someone has an issue? How would that/could that be done in our online space? Or at least doing so in private if someone had difficulty in speaking up. I suspect Gen2+ folks may have even bigger issues for contacting leadership for resolution depending on their level of technical ability. Who would they contact and how? Privately at least?

== planning considerations ==
* Location requires good internet for streaming
* Some kind of conference room microphone or professional videoconference setup (Mozilla locations have [[Vidyo]], which has worked well)
** see also: [[remote participation]]
* time: due to the international nature of the community, good times are mornings on the US west coast and evenings in Europe (e.g. [[2017/Leaders]] was at 09:00 PDT (UTC-7) == 16:00 UTC == 18:00 CEST (UTC+2)
