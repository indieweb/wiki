{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>itunes:summary</dfn>''' is an Apple iTunes proprietary XML namespace element that duplicates the functionality of the RSS description element, unnecessarily, as is common with XML namespaces, since [[iTunes]] will read the description tag if there is no itunes:summary tag. https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itc2b3780e76.
