A '''<dfn>connected home</dfn>''' is a home that contains multiple electronic devices that can communicate with each other and are accessible from a device outside the home. Typically these devices include cameras, light switches, lights, door sensors, garage door openers, and small kitchen appliances.

Apple sells a curated collection of connected home devices. http://store.apple.com/us/accessories/all-accessories/connected-home

== Brainstorming ==
Each device in the house can publish its own [[h-feed]] of content it generates. For example
* cameras can publish photos or video clips based on motion detection
* door sensors can publish an entry when a door is opened
* a motion sensor can publish an entry when it detects motion

An [[aggregator]] (or [[reader]]) can subscribe to each device's [[PuSH]] feed, and combine all the events into a single stream.

If you want to have some automation, such as a specific light turns on when motion is detected in a room, a bot can subscribe to the PuSH feed for the motion sensor, and when it receives an update, can tell a light to turn on.
