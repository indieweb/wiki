{{stub}}

'''<dfn>token input</dfn>''' is a style of form element which allows the user to type free-form text (or select a term via autocomplete), and then turns each term into a new inline element, usually outlining the term and showing a little "x" which allows the user to delete the term by clicking it.

{{kylewm}} uses [[Red Wind]] on kylewm.com and its [[creation]] UI has an input for [[person-tag]]s which implements token input. Kyle demonstrated this UI at the [[2015/SF|IndieWebCamp SF]] introductory demos.
