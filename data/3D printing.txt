'''<dfn>3D printing</dfn>''' is the construction of a physical three dimensional object from a digital model using a computer controlled printer. In the context of the Indieweb, this usually refers to posting about 3d printing on your website.

== David Shanske ==

As of 2021-04-01, having recently acquired a 3d printer, {{gwg}} is working on adding a section to his website to organize posts about the things he has built.

== Aaron Parecki ==
As of 2021-01-08, {{aaronpk}} has posted downloadable STL files with a description of the project on his website:
* https://aaronparecki.com/2021/01/08/18/blackmagic-sdi-hdmi-converter-cage

As of 2022-09-29, {{aaronpk}} has posted a "make" of someone else's design from Thingiverse
* Canonical version: https://aaronparecki.com/2022/09/29/13/dji-mini-2-case
* POSSE copy (manually POSSEd): https://www.thingiverse.com/make:1058390

== Marty McGuire ==
As of 2017-02-27, {{martymcguire}} has posted downloadable STL files with a description of the project on his website:
* https://martymcgui.re/2017/02/27/aeropress-wall-holder-le-two-parts/

As of 2020-05-23, he has also syndicated projects and "makes" (builds of other people's designs) from [[Thingiverse]] to his website:
* Thing example: https://martymcgui.re/2013/10/30/104417/
* "Made a copy" example: https://martymcgui.re/2013/03/08/131955/
* Tag where things and makes are collected: https://martymcgui.re/tag/3dp/

= Brainstorming =

So far, a general prototype for a post about a 3d printed object consists of a photo and a description, often linking to our incorporating the elements of the pages on [[Thingiverse]]. 

This may include details such as:
* The printer that constructed it
* The type of material/filament used
* Customizations
* The file used to generate the print.
* Source files used to make the printable part, such as design files for use with 3D modeling software.
