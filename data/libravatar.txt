'''<dfn>[https://www.libravatar.org/ Libravatar]</dfn>''' is a protocol [http://wiki.libravatar.org/api/ specification] for fetching avatar images for E-Mail addresses and [[OpenID]]s in a decentralized way.

It is also an open source service to host a profile photo (avatar) for e-mail addresses and personal sites used for identification (e.g. OpenID, IndieAuth). The photos can then automatically be displayed on your posts and comments on any website that supports it.

Alternatively, you can get a profile photo from the [[representative h-card]] and [[icon]] from a personal site.

In contrast to [[Gravatar]], which is a centralized service, libravatar is decentralized - each person can host their own avatar server. [http://wiki.libravatar.org/running_your_own/ Multiple server implementations] are available.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members that have setup their sites with libravatar support:


* {{cweiske}} runs his own avatar server, [https://sourceforge.net/projects/surrogator/ surrogator] - see the [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/surrogator.htm announcement blog post].
** avatar image for my main email address: http://avatar.cweiske.de/avatar/9e263681488308e5e5d5e548b2f9bc99?s=48
* [[User:Singpolyma.net|singpolyma]] supports libravatar on his site for his main email address: https://singpolyma.net/avatar/3ab4d3a66e470ce10eb7ec812fab3c46
