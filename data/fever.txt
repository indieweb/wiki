{{ stub }} 

<dfn>[http://feedafever.com fever]</dfn> is a propriety, single user, self-hosted, traditional [[Google reader]] style feed reader that costs a one time fee of $30 and only works on a single domain due to built in DRM and is written in php.  It has some interesting "sparks and trends" features which de-dupe articles in order to create a "fever" view of links that many articles link to.

* {{ bret }} - I used to run fever until malformed feeds hosed the backend DB.  It has a single developer, has a non-open source license, contains many bugs and never gets updated.  Do not recommend especially with all the other options these days.
