'''<dfn>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785 .well-known]</dfn>''' is literally the path "/.well-known/" under a domain and used as a standardized (literally a "[[well-known]]") location for discovering domain-wide meta-data, and is generally avoided by IndieWeb-related specs, instead preferring [[follow your nose]] discovery techniques and methods.

It has been codified by the IETF and IANA in [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785 RFC5785] and registry of [https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml Well-Known URIs] respectively.

== Current Uses ==
* [[Let's Encrypt]] for proof of domain ownership
* [[Thunderbird]] e-mail client autoconfiguration: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration], [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration/FileFormat/HowTo]
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/change-password-url/ W3C Working Draft: A Well-Known URL for Changing Passwords]
=== Questionable Uses ===
These should really be done via [[rel]] values instead:
* [[Do Not Track]] policy: https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2017/10/do-not-track-implementation-guide-launched
* [[WebFinger]] for discovery of user data (e.g. used by [[Mastodon]])
** there was a session at [[2023/SD|IWC SD 2023]] discussing how to use <code>rel</code> values instead

=== Past Uses ===
The following methods or utilizing technologies have been deprecated and/or obsoleted. Listed here for historical purposes only.
* [[Dat]] for linking domains to lookup keys on the dat network

=== Proposed Uses ===
Proposals for additional .well-known methods of discovery (in practice have seen little uptake)
* [[88x31]] buttons: https://codeberg.org/LunarEclipse/well-known-button
** Unnecessary because already handled, and per-page (which well-known doesn’t do) by <code>rel=[[icon]]</code> discovery. See [[88x31#How_to_markup_discovery|88x31: How to markup discovery]] for details: <code style="display:block"><nowiki><link rel="icon" sizes="88x31" href="examplebutton.png" /></nowiki></code>

== Criticism ==
A summary of why most uses of <code>/.well-known/</code> are a bad mistake.
* unnecessary and poor reinvention: many proposed uses of <code>/.well-known/</code> are already handled by [https://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values existing rel values], for far more use-cases and web hosting options
* more complex to author — typically requires [[sidefile-antipattern|sidefiles]]
* harder to publish — requires site admin root access
* likely to become inaccurate — [https://intertwingly.net/slides/2004/devcon/68.html Ruby’s postulate]
* fragile — site admins frequently break <code>/.well-known/</code> for individual pages/webapps inside.
* security vulnerability for community sites — community sites that are user-editable (e.g. via MediaWiki) could allow anyone to create a <code>/.well-known/</code> resource

Most of this summary is from part of a longer post https://tantek.com/2024/105/t1/w3c-advisory-committee-meetings.

Some of these expanded:
=== Bad reinvention ===
* Criticism: unnecessary domain-level assumption for use-cases that can by handled by resource-level discovery: it's almost always a web architecture error to design something for a domain (also includes broader [[well-known]] root file <code>/noun.txt</code> approaches) instead of designing for an arbitrary URL (HTML at some page) and using a <code>rel</code> attribute for discovery

Instead of forcing/squatting a specific path on web server admins, use link rel for discovery. 

The W3C [[Social Web Working Group]] resolved on this methodology (also known as "[[follow your nose]]") years ago for all the approaches being considered, and subsequently all of the W3C Recommendations they produce used link rel discovery, without any need for ".well-known"

=== Harder to publish ===
* Some web hosts restrict customer access to .well-known in shared plans, rendering it unusable for vast amounts of websites. Hosts known to not support full customer access to .well-known:
** [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71442532/how-can-i-get-my-hostinger-shared-hosting-server-to-execute-htaccess-file-in-hi hostinger]
* Some uses of well-known require the file be served with a specific content-type, e.g. application/json, which means that is no longer just a static file, and might require editing the HTTP server config to set the header as well

=== Unsuitable for community sites ===
* Problem: community sites that are user-editable (e.g. via MediaWiki) could allow anyone to create a .well-known resource (like this wiki page!) or a subresource like [[.well-known/security.txt]]
* Due to that vulnerability it’s a bad approach that is counter to the read-write web and adds extra [[admintax]] to all server maintainers: 
** "the point is .well-known is not the only way to do well-known URLs, so just blocking .well-known from being user-editable isn't enough, you have to go list out every possible well-known URL that might cause a problem if it's user-editable and block that too" [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] on [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2022-05-13/1652432145141300 May 13, 2022]

=== In practice unregistered ===
Everyone's supposed to register their .well-known URIs with IANA but pretty much nobody does
* https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml

=== Fragile due to corporate realities ===
* Marketing vs ops: another reason it is bad to depend on .well-known in practice: <blockquote>often times the root domain of a website is run by the marketing team at a company and isn't "owned" by the ops team that is providing whatever service is being discovered</blockquote>

== How to ==
=== How to test Apache/PHP web host support ===
Pieces of software like [[Bridgy Fed]] or [[Nextcloud]] usually either make use of Apache RewriteRules to serve content from .well-known. To check that this is possible on your web host, add the following to your root .htaccess file:

<pre><IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteRule
  RewriteRule ^\.well-known/test /well-known-test-succeeded [R=302,L]
</IfModule>
</pre>

Then, visit <code>yourdomain.com/.well-known/test</code>. If you were redirected to <code>yourdomain.com/well-known-test-succeeded</code>, then your host supports .well-known rewrites. If not, it likely doesn’t — please add your host to the list above!
