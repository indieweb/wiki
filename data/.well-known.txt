{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785 .well-known]</dfn>''' is literally the path "/.well-known/" under a domain and used as a standardized (literally a "[[well-known]]") location for discovering domain-wide meta-data, and is generally avoided by IndieWeb-related specs, instead preferring [[follow your nose]] discovery techniques and methods.

It has been codified by the IETF and IANA in [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785 RFC5785] and registry of [https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml Well-Known URIs] respectively.

== Relevant Uses ==
* [[Let's Encrypt]] for proof of domain ownership
* [[WebFinger]] for discovery of user data (e.g. used by [[Mastodon]])
* [[Dat]] for linking domains to lookup keys on the dat network
* to specify a [[Do Not Track]] policy: https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2017/10/do-not-track-implementation-guide-launched
* Thunderbird e-mail client autoconfiguration: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration], [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration/FileFormat/HowTo]
* [https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-change-password-url/ W3C Editor's Draft: A Well-Known URL for Changing Passwords]

== Issues ==
* Some web hosts restrict customer access to .well-known in shared plans, rendering it unusable for vast amounts of websites [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71442532/how-can-i-get-my-hostinger-shared-hosting-server-to-execute-htaccess-file-in-hi e.g. hostinger]
* Problem: community sites that are user-editable (e.g. via MediaWiki) could allow anyone to create a .well-known resource (like this wiki page!) or a subresource like [[.well-known/security.txt]]
* Criticism: bad approach that is counter to the read-write web and adds extra [[admintax]] to all server maintainers: https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2022-05-13/1652432145141300
** "the point is .well-known is not the only way to do well-known URLs, so just blocking .well-known from being user-editable isn't enough, you have to go list out every possible well-known URL that might cause a problem if it's user-editable and block that too" [http://aaronparecki.com @aaronpk] May 13, 2022
* Criticism: unnecessary domain-level assumption for use-cases that can by handled by resource-level discovery: it's almost always a web architecture error to design something for a domain (also includes root /noun.txt approaches) instead of designing for an arbitrary URL (HTML at some page).
* Criticism: everyone's supposed to register their .well-known URIs with IANA but pretty much nobody does

* Alternative: instead of forcing/squatting a specific path on web server admins, use link rel for discovery. The W3C [[Social Web Working Group]] resolved on this methodology (also known as "follow your nose") years ago for all the approaches being considered, and subsequently all of the W3C Recommendations they produce used link rel discovery, without any need for ".well-known"
