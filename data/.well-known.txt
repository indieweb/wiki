'''<dfn>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785 .well-known]</dfn>''' is literally the path "/.well-known/" under a domain and used as a standardized location for discovering domain-wide meta-data.

It has been codified by the IETF and IANA in [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785 RFC5785] and registry of [https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml Well-Known URIs] respectively.

== Relevant Uses ==
* [[Let's Encrypt]] for proof of domain ownership
* [[WebFinger]] for discovery of user data (e.g. used by [[Mastodon]])
* [[Dat]] for linking domains to lookup keys on the dat network
* to specify a [[Do Not Track]] policy: https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2017/10/do-not-track-implementation-guide-launched
* Thunderbird e-mail client autoconfiguration: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration], [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration/FileFormat/HowTo]
* [https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-change-password-url/ W3C Editor's Draft: A Well-Known URL for Changing Passwords]

== See Also ==

* [[well-known]]
* Problem: community sites that are user-editable (e.g. via MediaWiki) could allow anyone to create a .well-known resource (like this wiki page!) or a subresource like [[.well-known/security.txt]]
