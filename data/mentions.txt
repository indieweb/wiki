A <dfn>mentions</dfn> page lists webmentions sent to a website.

"Mentions" may refer to:
* Webmentions, [[notifications]] of linking sent using the [[Webmention]] protocol
* [[mention]] posts, a type of response created implicitly by linking

== Why ==
A [[mentions]] page could be used to send notifications to a mobile app such as [[mention-app]].
