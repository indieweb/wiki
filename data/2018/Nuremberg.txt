The '''third IndieWebCamp in Nuremberg''', but just one of many [[IndieWebCamps]]!

<div class="e-description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. To grow it and help people gettings started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Nuremberg for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, teaching, helping.

Join us during the [https://nuernberg.digital/festival/ Nürnberg Digital Festival 2018] (née Nuremberg Web Week) and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe more importantly – encourage users to own their own content and identities.
