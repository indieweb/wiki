 '''IndieWebCamp returns to NYC''', but its just one of many [[IndieWebCamps]] scheduled for 2018!

<div class="e-description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. Yet we need to build both the technical and societal systems to ensure a free and open web for the future. We invite computer engineers, hackers, activists, teachers, students and journalist to this two day event.

For computer science students, hackers, and engineers come together to help build tools that will allow everyone to take control of their data and own their own domain. The top engineers in the world attend IndieWebCamps.


IndieWebCamp will also draw many educators who have taken interest in "Domain of One's Own" for students. Many university faculty will attend both locally and remotely to discuss how we bring the #IndieWeb to K12 and higher education.

For journalist at the event we want to rethink how local news can support the local news. No one took a greater hit from the silos than journalist. It is clear truth soon followed.

Regardless of your studies or what you #IndieWebCamp is for everyone. If you just want to launch your first blog and have never been online before...well then you are the guest of honor. Come down and take control of your digital identity.

'''[https://www.pace.edu/seidenberg/]'''Pace University looks forward and meets the challenges of educating 21st century leaders. Nowhere is that more apparent than at the Seidenberg School where faculty prepare students for careers that donâ€™t yet exist, using tools that have not yet been invented.
