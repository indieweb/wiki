== Notes ==

* web archiving
* how to make it decentralized
* IA is largest, but many others
* countries investing, for cultural preservation

* often short lived

* archive-it.org
* IA's subscription service

* European efforts - large national collections/archives
* then changed domain name
* broke every link
* our aggregator detected something wrong
* did make an announcement, but no details
* had to look in the IA to find the new location (WTF)
* -> need to decentralize

* archives, even when stable and well run, can still be shut down by govt, etc
* the short life and history of the web is in these few archives
* newspaper was the hard copy, even 200 years ago
* but try finding a website from 10 yrs ago

* Old Dominion University
* lab in the CS dept
* questions like "how much of the web is archived"

* IPWayback
* hackathon project

* warc files
* http + extra headers
* compiled serially
* way to void inode limits
* no worries about file types, etc
* offsets in the file
* higher level tools: indexers, storage compression, etc

* problems: lots of deduping, etc
* leverage deduping of content addressibility
* store headers and payload separately
* instead, store two hashes for headers and payload
* doesn't matter where it's stored anymore - location independent

* index is not decentralized yet
* ipns maybe a solution - url path -> digest
* ipns doesn't have history though
* one way is using blockchain for history
* then you can get history and what time changed
* protocol called memento - has rfc
* you can query "example.com at date time x"
* can interop across different archives
* ipns blockchain on github
* some namespacing would help - for sets of what is archived
* IPLD maybe help - lazy eval to find all the archives of a given page
* namespaces would allow different views - logged in vs geo differences in rendering, etc
* standardized way of aggregating across those differences

* how to protect personal info in the archive
* how to do personal web archiving

* dweb storage is not magic
* someone is actually storing
* need resilient way of preserving/serving if someone dies, or goes offline, etc

* ipfs cluster and other tools

* british library
* aware of ipfs, but not taken seriously
* can't say blockchain
* so much invested in status quo
* still just finally got the hang of http

* how to elevator pitch decentralization
* 

* branding
* "search" means google
* "wayback machine" - no, there are more
* IIPC, and more
* some countries block IA

* memgator - memento aggregator
* collect from 12-13 different web archives
* then IA went down from ddos
* but still demoing memgator because pulled from other archives

* YACY
* body of knowledge w/o search is not useful
* focus on critical availability
* auto balance availability of resources across DHT

* web archiving people + FFF
*

== Remote Thoughts ==
Hashing of content is a great way to deal with archiving, if we can get uniform hashes and query by hash across systems. Currently systems  tend to suck at this - they hash not the resource, but the resource plus some local context, so the same resourcegets a differnt hash. IA uses SHA1 by default, but I've been waiting for them to ship the query by SHA1 since 2016

see https://www.svgshare.com/dweb for an example

The Reynolds Journalism Insititute hosts an annual news/archiving conference every year, a lot of what they're discussing covers doing mass archiving
