[[Data Transfer Project]]
* GitHub repository for the project: https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project

* Use Cases
** discovers new service wants to import
** user wants to stop and wants their data
** transfer between download and upload
** many more
** these use cases are after the fact , why not start from our sites to our servies
** I want to use services like Google photo recognition but not store my photos of Google
** Not just export, but on the import. All of the use cases are after the fact, portability can start at publish from my site.
*** Google treats the photo as a copy and knows it is originally on our websites
*** micropub would allow for greater portability 
** sync between services

* Ability to have Creative Commons or other licensing to follow the content along
** If I put a video on YouTube with a CC-By license (an option) no one can actually remix and adapt because downloading the video may violate YouTube's ToS. 

* What is data transfer project
** connect any two online services
** enable user data transfer

* Example
** Twitter photos
** SmugMug/Flickr
** email to email

* Prototype
** Google Dashboard (not production) will have a data transfer button
** the metadata and media came on
** there is a white paper

* Questions
** what about comments
** not sure what is in the common model
