NATE!!!!! HELLO Howdy!

{{jgmac1106}} walked through example of his having sent badges from his recent class [https://edu522.networkedlearningcollaborative.com edu522]

=== Event Attendance example ===

jgmac1106 wrote up a workflow for event attendance. Photo: https://martymcgui.re/imageproxy/960,fit,sCf_co3HWAIZ4fBP7CHdvkr3u8vCz64k1USJq5CitASc=/https://media.martymcgui.re/66/d8/28/6f/71f30adaed0f3c6caf935cc3822e799a0bf375e53d74462aff6f3ff5.jpg

=== IndieMon ===
Not too dissimilar to Pokemon Go where people can collect monsters, which could be done via webmention per {{t}} conversation with {{benwerd}}
indiemon brainstorming design starts here: https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-07-14#t1468465361878000 
Three actors: 
    Venue creators 
    Monster creator
    Monster collectors

This also sounds similar to sticker replies or [[photo_reply]].
* +1 the UX from a tool like slack is another interesting way to casually recognize somebody. I built a little proof of concept hipchat bot last year that would react to "/props to jgmac1106 for coming up with interesting ways to use badges" to award a "kudos" badgeclass with open badges 2.0 evidence narrative of "for coming up with interesting ways to use badges" -Nate

This same concept could be done as a digital passport for checkins and travel which includes digital passport stamps.

"Monster creator" inspiration: https://gopherize.me/

=== Assertion Workflows ===
{{gwg}}: Since I wasn't going to try Indiemon, I wrote up my technical suggestion for {{jgmac1106}} https://david.shanske.com/2018/09/28/thoughts-about-assertion-workflows/
