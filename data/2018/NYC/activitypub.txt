== Notes ==

we need to stop calling things *pub

brid.gy connects the ActivityPub world to the indieweb world at https://fed.brid.gy/

aaronpk: I wrote a similar tool, haven't published it yet

dmitri: what are the reasons we might not want to use twitter?

fediverse.party

a lot of those aren't activitypub and using Ostatus
eg PostActiv  GnuSocial

http://www.unmung.com/mastoview - shows the local/federated feeds of a mastodon instance as h-feed

ActivityStreams is just over 10 years - it grew out of Identica and OpenSocial - at one point a lot of social networks supported them (even facebook)

OStatus is Atom, PubSubHubbub and Salmon (also Webfinger)

activityStreams was Atom first though, before it was JSON
