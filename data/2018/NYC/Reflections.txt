'''<dfn>2018/NYC/Reflections</dfn>''' is a page for documenting what went well during [[2018/NYC|IndieWebCamp NYC 2018]], and what could be improved.

== Good ==
* {{t}} coffee! (thanks {{schmarty}})
* {{t}} venue space itself was very conducive to open conversations and collaboration, would go to again if we are able to get Pace to host again!
* {{jgmac1106}} look outside of IndieWeb for keynotes. Be very intentional in diversity and inclusion efforts.
** +1 {{t}} breadth of keynotes was the best of any IndieWebCamp yet. Should definitely look to repeat this as much as possible at future camps.
* {{jgmac1106}} Dead rabbit.

* {{t}} photos. need to remember to take photos of/during each session to save on each session's page.
* {{jgmac1106}} try to check any Manhattan dates with UN being in session. Received 2 emails about the extra transit time caused by extra national security and 1 email about being afraid of terrorism when UN is in session.
* {{jgmac1106}} aligning strengths of organizers with tasks. I felt kind of alone having to do it all. I had ask in help in numerous tasks without realizing people are not comfortable with some items such as cold contacting venues and possible sponsors whereas I do not excel at small details.
* {{jgmac1106}} Make sure tasks are evenly distributed among co-organizers. I felt overwhelmed at times but would did not feel comfortable asking other organizers for help. They are volunteers as well.
* {{jgmac1106}} Develop a concrete and scheduled communication plan.
* {{jgmac1106}} recruit volunteers from early ticket purchasers to help organizers.
* {{jgmac1106}} the no show to ticket purchase ratio was too high.
