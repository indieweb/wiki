The '''<dfn>Leaders Meetup</dfn>''' is a half-day of activities and sessions the day (2018-09-26) before [[2018/NYC|IndieWebCamp NYC 2018]], for everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] in the past two years or at least two Homebrew Website Club meetups with at least one meetup photo.

== Who ==
Similar to [[2018/Leaders]], the [[2018/NYC/Leaders|Leaders]] Meetup sessions are open to everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] from 2015-2018, planning an IndieWebCamp later this year, or co-organized at least two [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups during those years, and posted at least one meetup photo. If you’re not sure, ask an [[2018/NYC#Organizers|organizer]].

== What ==
Specific, timely suggestions for ''this'' Leaders meetup by folks who will be there (otherwise please add to:  [[Leaders#next]]).

Meta: this list is
* Unordered
* To be prioritized by Leaders in-person at the meetup
* Inevitably incomplete (feel free to bring up more topics in https://chat.indieweb.org/meta)
* May have some items pre-empted by existing/longer-term '''[[Leaders#Issues]]''' (and that's ok).

What:
* {{t}} suggestion '''reading/viewing BEFORE the meetup''':
** everything linked from this section "[http://microformats.org/wiki/mailing-lists#Why_to_avoid_negative_behaviors Why to avoid negative behaviors]" from the microformats wiki
*** especially Kathy Sierra article and Google Videos about dealing with poisonous people

* {{t}} '''meta on Leaders Summit / Meetup'''
** What did we think we did right / better / worse compared to last year?
** What did we leave open / unresolved from [[2018/Leaders#Next_Time]]?
** What new community challenges have we encountered since?
** What are the most important things we can do to improve the community in the coming uyear?
** Which of those are the easiest / most scalable?
* *: '''Remaining/ongoing tasks from [[2018/Leaders#Task_List]]'''
* {{aaronpk}}: '''Slack/IRC admin help''' - mods, permissions, deleting spam
* {{gRegor}} '''Decide on workflow for Leaders Issues''' proposed 2018-09-11
** tl;dr: Where do new issues go and how do we track them through next steps/did-not-finish/completion?
** Leading up to [[2018/Leaders]] there was confusion because that page was originally copy-pasta from [[2017/Leaders]], including the sessions. People started adding comments to those sessions as if they were new. On top of that, [[Leaders]] had a list of actually-new issues. In chat, before [[2018/Leaders]], {{t}} said we should keep new issues to [[Leaders]]. I took some time to split out new-for-2018 comments and merged them into [[Leaders]]. Day-of 2018 Leaders, we prioritized sessions in etherpad and they ended up in one of three sections based on whether there were totally done, had todo items, or we did not get to discuss them.
** Here's my proposal for the workflow: [[User:Gregorlove.com/sandbox]]
** +1 {{t}}
* {{t}}: '''Homepage update''' (and [[principles]] update, complete work from [[2018/Leaders]]). We did major updates in [[2014/SF|2014]] (the three icons/points), [[2016/Leaders#homepage|2016]] (new skin, lots of wording updates). It's reasonable to do another update of the home page this year (2018) with everything we've learned as well as the growth of the community and new services like micro.blog, consider feedback like ”[https://twitter.com/danielsouza/status/1029467640534851584 remove all the nerdiness]“, and reconsider remaining [[2016/Leaders#homepage|2016]] ideas. I'd like to do at least a draft of this (homepage update) during IWC NYC at a minimum as a [[2018/NYC/Leaders]] session to start with, and possibly a session on [[2018/NYC|IWC NYC day 1]].

* {{t}}: '''Homepage update: three paths''' - a specific brainstorm for the above. 
** We might benefit from a 2-3 track home page - address the "only for self-coders" misimpression/misframing
** I think we roughly need three tracks for three generations at this point (I think we are that spread out)
** 1. (gen 3, savvy users, no/low admin) Want to switch to IndieWeb? Here's how (micro.blog etc.)
** 2. (gen 2, WordPress users who are familiar adminning their own install, use plugins etc.) Want to use your WordPress on the IndieWeb? Here's how (step by step tutorial for plugins, configuring them, testing posting+POSSE+backfeed)
** 3. (devs, gen 1) Want to make your own indieweb site? Here's how (existing Getting Started docs)
*** make it clear this is also for you if you are building software for other people, like micro.blog
*** whether you're building a site for one or for thousands, here's how you can do it (to address misconception/misframing of "build things that only you will use")
*** at the same time, there is a lot of value in the principle of building for yourself, just in this case it means make sure the thing you're building for other people you also use yourself
** we order it in that way because better to appeal to the gen 3 folks first (there are more of them), and quickly help them before they get confused / overloaded. the WordPress crowd will find the WordPress path, IF it is labeled as such for them. and the homegrown / coder crowd will find read everything til they find the github links etc. and keep going
** I think if we look at rethinking the home page for these three "tracks", it will help illuminate how we need to update other pages linked from the home page like /principles
** we could literally have three equal width columns, each roughly the width of a typical mobile portrait display, different background colors, maybe even different font choices
** scroll down with different "bands" of background brightness for different "topics"
** e.g. join the discussion: #indieweb #indieweb-wordpress #indieweb-dev
** column layouts like that become tabs on mobile with the bright backgrounds of each in each tab, with summaries
*** | Join the IndieWeb | WordPress users | Developers |
*** defaulting to Join the IndieWeb, expecting Wordpress / Developers to self-select
** so it looks good both on desktop and mobile
* {{t}} '''Move IndieWeb/IndieWebCamp tweets to meta'''
** From reviewing the past 5+ days of tweets (2018-09-06..11) going to the #indieweb channel and most of them are dev-related, some are -meta related, and a few (very few) are higher level indieweb user-centric related
** We already have some dev-related keywords going to #indieweb-dev (like Webmention)
** I'd be up for switching whatever tweets currently make it to #indieweb to instead go to #indieweb-meta
** For *tweets* only in particular, that is:
*** I still think we should surface indieweb #indieweb posts to the main channel (from WebSub / Superfeedr)
*** [[Twitter]] has also become more negative (regardless of topic), thus meta is better than main for that because we can discuss the meta aspect of such negativity if necessary rather than having them pollute and "bring down" the main channel (recent indieweb tweets seem fairly positive, though we've seen negative attacks before which typically are about some meta issue, not anything actually directly indieweb applicable to someone's personal site)
** Thoughts?
