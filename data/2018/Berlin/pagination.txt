Background:
* [[pagination]]
Related:
* [[navigation]]
* [[archive]]

* summary
** identify your stream's guiding/sorting factor  (e.g. date)
** align pagination to that (and multiples of that)
** don't split entries into pages (what does this mean? - there are content providers which show a single article in multiple pages, eg. part 1 -2 -3)
** try to avoid pagination comments 
** if you use infinite scroll:
*** don't use a footer
*** have a no-js fallback
** h-feed needs a previous/next URL if it's paginated
** closely tied in with /archive (wiki)


* why/when?
** data size (lots of photos)

* why not/when not?
** comments?
*** welp, depends on size
** 

* are numbered pages any good?
** reverse can be
** normal order shifts content when new appears

* infiinite scroll is evil
* why?
** prevents footer
** needs JS

* pagination of a single entry is also evil

* calendar view
** greyed out days with no content
** per day archives for the rest

* UI ideas
** scrollbar, showing dates - see Kartik's solution for static per year/per month pages
** per date/per date range pagination
** logarithmic navigation (first, XZ previous, X previous, Y next, YZ next, end)

* "API"
** h-feed next/prev to link to another h-feed of items next/prev in the sequence
