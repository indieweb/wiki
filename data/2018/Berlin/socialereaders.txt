== Notes ==
* why did Tiara want to do this topic?
* she wants to not have to use multiple apps and be able to integrate everything on to one platform
* learn how to set up and how to use an e-reader
* main idea is that the stuff that you care about should be in your control
* dont need to have your own server but should be able to do what you like
* subscribed to someones site posts you should be able to control how you are seeing this 
* interchangeable and interoperable 
* someone is working on a wordpress plugin
* written into own website and post are stored in own website 
* not being limited by the tools that your website provides and not limited with the apps 
* want data to live on own site
* aperature is the backend and apps like together indigenous just read data from where you tell them to
* website should be the center and starting point and should have the option to write own software
* in the back you have something like webmention and a microsub server (aperature) - aperature is akin to webmention.io
* could put the software in the code but dont have to
* website links to those softwares
* when someone else writes a blog post and if they want to reply to you they ask where your webmention point is
* talk to different forms to get the information
* you can swap out these software 
* reason:plugable building blocks
* get started:go to aperature.p3k.io
* login in and follow all the feeds you want
* make channels
* there is a plugin for wordpress 
* micropub server and link to it on webpage <code>&lt;link url=microsub href="..."&gt;</code>
* there are other servers being built Aperature, Drupal indieweb module, Dobrado (full cms), Yarns (WordPress), Ekster (in go), 
* two proxies (for Innoreader, and Newsblur and Feedly)
* apps expect list of channels and posts from server and the applet formats it nicely
* app doesnt care if its rss or something else
* translates the data
* {{sebsel}} worked on in nuremberg with what other people are liking
* alternate data into the server you and getting into the app for reading
* missing piece is being able to comment on something from the reader- this is where micropub comes in, buttons on the post 
* once reader shows post and  you hit a button it wants to reply back to the original post at micropub endpoint
* your site will then make a webmention
* find webmention endpoint and submit the comment
* having it integrated makes it easier
* how do i tell my microsub to do this?
* login, make channel,add feeds, can add api key (special to aperature)
* examples of channels: 
** Aaron has home-automation and runs a server at his house thats not online but make it show up on reader
** show webmention on post,web hook feature
*ownership of data done modularly 
*becasue its modular it can be customized
*you can use a different app for the same data, different apps will have different views
* think of some hardware in your house that only shows two lines of text: to let feeds show up there is a lot of work. With Microsub, it's just one call.
*stream.indieweb.org- public view 
*when you make a channel there are settings and you can say to include or exlude certain post, or keywords, easy to manage
*need authentication piece <link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com"> <a href="https://github.com/" rel="me">
