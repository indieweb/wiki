== Notes ==
* goal of the session is not to discuss legal questions, nor GDPR; we simply want to start a discussion where indieweb sites use data about other people that potentially comes with a responsibility to deal with it ethically.
** comes with big questions: who defines what is ethical? how can a shared understanding be established in a community-driven open source movement like this, how can it be rooted in practice?
** no simple answer but worthwhile to inject the debate into indieweb efforts (session goal is discussion, not solution)

* pulling likes and retweets to display on website there was an issue if a user didnt hear of indieweb they arent aware that their name would be used on the website it was being pulled to
* was using pixel images to link back to original post
* do indie website fall under gdpr? - we are not lawyers, don't get into that (personal websites don't fall under gdpr, so you don't need a privacy statement e.g., but doesn't mean you can post personal data) (depends on what your lawyer thinks "household activity" is)
* there is not really a difference between processing and storing the content or data (again not a lawyer disclaimer)
* there is no distiniction between storing and processing in GDPR
* seeking permission to share the data or is it that because it is on the web it is therefore public
** where do you define the line for this?
*  twitter users grant twitter the right to use their data and dont have ownership
* from use case point of view you make a post to another persons site, realize it wasnt a good idea and you want to delete it can you?
** yes using gone on the server so it is removed 
* private copy is ethically a different thing
* ethics on the indieweb not the legallity of it
* hard to speak about legallity of it because right now it is only basic information and not very fine tuned. Need test cases for this
* what is the data we process, what indieweb-protocols are potentially affected?
* how do we deal with it? does it need new mechanisms?
**who decides this on an opensource indieweb?
* is the online realm a public or private space?
** if someone is on twitter visable to all that their content can be harvested onto third parties or do they think it will only be shared amongst friends?
* can people be trusted to make the decision about sharing or processing personal data?
* spirit of the law can be more murky
* calculated vs not calculated
* What data is theirs to control?
* petermolnar- you should license your content all of the time 
* licensing in social media is a mess, you give rights to facebook to republish, does that mean it gives the right to others to do so?
* having a public instagram left images open to be used else where, being harvested. Needed to make private to get them removed
* knowing the worst case scenarios
* making informed choices
* can things be used if on public domains?
** don't use the information unless it is explicitly said that it can be used 
* looking further into if there is a license instead of infering that it doesn't
* infrences that they pinged me and that they have the refrence 
* terms and conditions 
** how broad can these be? is there a better way to do it?
* actively sharing 
* superfeeder feed
* anyone can send a web mention to anyone 
* licensing on its own in microformats need to know what it means 
* url- can you share the url without an ethical issue
*spam-hundered of webmentions-type of attack vector
* webmentions spam hypothetical, but possible, haven't found any historical evidence yet
* twitter grants the right to remove their likes, retweets etc
* flags- share okay, republish okay
* robots text files
* no index, no archive meta tags
* linux foundation- short identifiers for licenses (https://spdx.org/licenses/)
* meta tag for micro information on licenses/redistribution (there apparently had been an existing proposal on the indieweb, to use an attribute on a-tags to express that a webmention should not be sent/processed; idea was not further developed - reference?)
* what is the standard, using something that already exists
* embeds
*discussed at another indieweb camp - see https://indieweb.org/2017/Nuremberg/law
*block post- write a link with something for no webmention as link tag attiribute 
you can always hide the webmention endpoint on a post per post basis, your CMS may not let you?
*being able to talk about there people's sites without them receiving webmentions about it 
*robots.txt on domain
* fair use 
*parse the url, infer hcard as showing information
* oembed as permission
** meta tags in place to allow oembed to define how the content should show up on another website
* oembed needs to be enable 
* need explicit plugin to publish
*wordpress.com has it
* web mention in a way claims control over the data- fuzzy/blurred topic
* hierarchy of signals- a scorecard 
** IP reputaion- new IP will be marked as spam, starts as a - score
* not a new question
** public intrest, the information if out there makes it vulnerable for abuse
* different countries = different laws
* if by displaying all responses i recieve does it make it an open dialouge, taking out certain responses to match personal views
*what do the silos do?
*algorithom for how a webmention comes up
* vouch trust topic 
*we should document which of the silos are defining comments belong to the poster of comment or the person who owns the source being commented on
* example of a webmention missing context of a network: http://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/10/28/hypatiadotca-if-i-come-off-as-a I was responding to a webmention not to Twitter and this thread: https://twitter.com/hypatiadotca/status/1056624889849737216
 thus I missed much of the historical and cutural impacts of the first tweet, and was called out , rightfully so for jumping in where my voice wasn't needed, and for violating a norm of the network when I was just replying from my site... add notes

summary:
    
some of the aspects to consider
* license (is licensing a solution? how could it be done? content license vs. "license" to process data?)
* terms and conditions of silos (silos grant their users control over their data; API users are subject to that, how does this need to be considered?)
* inferred permission from using a certain protocol (e.g. Google infers from use of AMP that site can be made available via AMP)
* various spam aspects (both incoming, but also displaying webmentions that were not intended by the original author; everybody can send a webmention on behalf of somebody else)
* oembed features (does provision of an oembed endpoint imply that the site owner is ok with webmentions to be displayed?)

potential starting points for exploration:
* could a "vouch" mechanism help identify users whose webmentions are intentional? (or some other way this mechanism can be useful?)
* if licenses etc. are to be used, what would be the machine-readable format; vs. how is the user made aware that their site is sending these?
* use of metatags (comparable to "noindex" or "noarchive), either on page or link level - e.g. to express denial/permission to display a webmention?
* some robot.txt (or similar) level default policy for an entire domain?
* provision of oembed as permission for webmention display

discussion:
* it's a wicked problem and there is no easy answer!
* potentially a combination of factors (a "hierarchy of signals", like a score) could help siteowners to determine what to display
* risk of creating an algorithm (that's what the silos do; but is an "indie-algorithm" really desirable?it would have to be very open and transparent for sure)
