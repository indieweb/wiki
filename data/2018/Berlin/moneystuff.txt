== Notes ==
* There are microformats for offers, and products, etc. But why not for contracts.
* What is a contract? Sometimes it is just a transaction of something, e.g. ownership.
* Tracking obligations / special dates.

* Transactions already being published?
** https://rhiaro.co.uk/2018/11/5bddbd50ef3b5
** Venmo did this?

* Could commerce systems send information to people about their transactions?

* Standardized format
** Have a common format/interface: transaction types, products/services, termination period...

There is an "official" process for establishing a new microformat (includes a research phase) microformats.org/wiki/process
