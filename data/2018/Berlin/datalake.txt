== Notes ==
=== How to store ===

* media vs format
* licensing is interesting: public, permissive licensed has chance to get additional copies outside
* media:
** reliablitiy of media vs reliability of interfaces
** Tape is awesome in reliability/storage duration, but readers are expensive and need to be maintained too
** optical: CD is random, DVDs (outside maybe M-Disk?) less good. readers long-term available. Blue-Ray: archival grade available, cheap ones organic storage layers. Expensive media too. 
** Flash (SD, SSD, CF, ...) loose data (charge) if unpowered for extensive period (~5 years) (SSDs I've seen numbers in the months if not stored in cold places)
** HDDs are relatively cheap, sturdy even if stored powered off
* digital:
** text is great
** common, simple formats are good (jpg, png)
** PDF is complex - if you do want to store to print, LaTeX (https://www.latex-project.org/) or PostScript
** potentially: archive software too if possible (trickier for modern, clound-connected software) - if archiveing source code, archive compiler, and all dependencies as well

=== how to archive (structure) ===
* who wants to find it
** indexed from structure vs search based, flexible data
** automatic tagging can work surprisingly well nowadays for images
** petermolnar: images archived by topic, data, occasion
** storage of metadata in files themselves is attractive (easy to move etc), but can be tricky with non-text format
** simple index evolved into ontology/tagging 

=== How to find stuff ===
* again audience: if external users, central, somewhat standardized hierarchy is useful.
* full-text search

*4 How to share/publish
*5 how to gather all
**browser hierachy would be great worldbrain.io, webmemex
