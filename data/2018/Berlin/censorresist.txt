== Notes ==
Current web infrastructure
* single centralized server has 100% control 
* all the client can do is request 
* single point of failure 
* how can we design systems that might mitigate the sensorabilituy of projects today?
*distributed web projects
*1.5 billion estimated sites
* how can we make sure they stay accessible?
* ipfs 
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System
* only for content that doesnt change 
* peer discovery 
** behind the router so you can host the ip address 
* browsers have been passive clients that can only make request
* p2p is not a direct request between two parties
* ipfs is not a two party direct response relationship
* response can come from the nearest peer holding the hash
* mesh networkd
** 20 requests sent until someone holding the hash returns it saying they have it
** distributed hash table 
*single object dispensed between many different holders
** similar to tcp/ip architecture
* passed along until someone says that they have it
* honey pots
* what are the pros and cons for censorship
*request based on hash, hash is not immutable, series of changes --> similar to git  
* relation to a browser-doesnt particularly matter
* Beaker is a Chromium-based browser for DAT.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_(web_browser)
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dat_(software)
*dat stream is referred to as dat archive
** folder that contains all data of web app
* ipfs has immutable data.
*site that is ipfs enable can the url 
* Can retrieve data from local peers.
** Can it be configured to only request locally?
* access a javascript api that allows you to write new files to the folder 
* can this be synced 
* front end and back end dont make sense anymore when you have them both running in the same space
* forking a dat archive is easy, with cryptographical signatures to differentiate between authors
* ipfs is about immutability- dat is about changes
* if i write something very critical about a government, the government can then blacklist my site
*immutable content can also get hacked
** trust being misplaced
* does tor content play well with ipfs format?
** its not all traffic
*proxy p2p traffic to tor
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)
* will site work served from ipfs inside censored country?
* trust is the problem no matter what
* trust anchor
** certificate authority (CA) infrastructure
* trust is through domain name on regular web browser
* out of band (OOB) key exchange
** SSL public key and private key
*mirrors CA problem
**always delegating authority when trusting others
*exposure 
* bitcoin chain contains several pieces of "illegal material" (both for certain legislative areas/countries, and for a large number of legislative areas/countries)
*  new architectures for publishing but not protecting individuals doing the publishing
** these new architectures are very different from the status quo 
* understanding the architectual differences that keep these two worlds seperated 
* how do you bring these things together?
* service that copy and serve through a gateway
* filecurrency is backed by file storage services
