== Notes ==

=== systems for media gallery sites ===
* https://piwigo.org/
* https://mediagoblin.org/ (also does videos etc, better)
* 

=== publisher use cases ===
* post a photo in the social stream – covered by [[photo]] posts
* post a small-ish photos (5-20?), potentially with context/comments. Probably solved as an [[article]]
* post a gallery of many pictures, e.g. "200 pictures taken at a conference", "100 pictures from my summer holiday"


=== What is the difference between a Gallery and "all photos tagged X" ===
In the real world, a gallery is a white box with curated content
translate this to the web:
* custom order (or by special metadata, e.g. time when picture was taken)
* "nice" presentation (e.g. probably not a common post feed with post date etc, but more things like an image grid. maybe some images highlighted)
* the gallery might be an object in itself (e.g. so people can comment on it, like it, ... maybe reply with new images, has featured image etc)
* 

=== Should images have individual pages/posts ===
reasons for it:
* images have metadata that might be interesting (e.g. time taken), markup is unclear. 
* People can link and interact with individal images

possible gallery enhancements:
* "live" gallery based on (one or more) hashtag(s) - new photos tagged as such are automatically added to the end of the gallery

== What do people use Flickr for ==

https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2018/11/flickr-account-changes-and-bringing-things-home/
<blockquote>
How do I use Flickr?

    It’s an off-site back-up of photos

    I use it to find Creative Commons licensed material for my presentations

    I publish photos under such a license myself, to enable others to use them

    I embed Flickr photos in my blogposts, so I do not have to store them on my hosting account (which has much less storage, 3GB)

    I use it to quickly find things back in my own photos, through its album structure and search. “Don’t I have a picture of that building from when I visited that conference in Copenhagen a few years ago?”

* Toni: People can build galleries that include other peoples photos
** machine readable metadata helps, especially license again
* Schmarty: has a pool for the hackerspace, which people can submit images to
** Indieweb equivalent could be indienews-like aggregator

flickr also good for public search
* search across users
* photos with a tag
* photos with a person-tag


Search on single site is "relatively easy"
multi-site search is a challenge.
* is there a search engine for e.g. CC images
** Creative Commons has one searching known CC archives
** Google has a search flag to search for CC content, detection mechanism unknown
* markup (esp of license etc too) might improve quality over google image search etc
* potential experiment: search indiemap for photo posts with tags - does that produce useful results?
* callback to search session in Nürnberg: would federated search help in social circles (search friends/friends of friends for events)
