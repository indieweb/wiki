== Notes ==
Seff-hosting. Cloudron.

This barcamp will focus on setting up your own server with a platform, designed to make it suer easy to run on of the various Open Source self-hostable apps.

We could set up a nice personal infrastructure host, to keep your data, have it backed up and easy to work with.

The audience decides how technical we want it to be.

Goals
* people who already host their things using low-level standard unix tools
* here to steal tips on expanding it

Information to host
* Files (dropbox-like)
* Calendars
* Contacts
* etc.
