== Notes ==
* Joel would like to be able to get rid of passwords; using webauthn as a single factor autentication (1FA).
** Was pointed at selfauth and its JS fork
** Wants to get WebAuthn in there
* Joel would also like to use webauthn as the simplest way (if you already have a token) to "register" on a website.
** Just click the button (on the physical token) at the login prompt.
** Identifying as a returning is the same procedure.
** Might need to keep backup authentication methods (additional physical tokens? indieauth? email single-use tokens?) per user, in case the physical token is lost.
* Adding webauthn to indieauth.com might not be a good approach, due to @aaronpk changing project direction.
** Is still open source and self-hostable.


* Some solutions:
** https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth
** https://martymcgui.re/2018/03/12/130455/ -> https://glitch.com/~befitting-price
** https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieauth ~ could be used in combination with any other login replacing plugin
** https://github.com/fido-alliance/webauthn-demo
*** a demo in NodeJS.
*** Has only placeholders for the actual webauthn code, "to be added" during a workshop.
** https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy
*** a general 2f library in NodeJS
** https://github.com/apowers313/webauthn-simple-app
*** Should be a working implementation.
*** Customizations/configuration/defaults not fully documented? See source code.
*** See also other webauthn/fido projects by apowers313.

* Soft tokens VS hardware tokens
** Soft tokens would interface with the same standard, but from computer software rather than USB (or other hardware stacks)
** Can be a bridge between the browser and any (?) other means of authentication.
** Would most likely require the browser to know about the new method, which might not be possible without recompilation (?) or perhaps very low-level plugins.

* It is good to see WebAuthn standard, but who will start using it?
** Google is using it a lot internally
** How can we get more CMS systems to support these systems?
*** Plugins to modify or replace login screens?
