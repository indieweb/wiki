== Notes ==
Note: Use "HTML class name": http://tantek.com/2012/353/b1/why-html-classes-css-class-selectors

Charlie likes how adding HTML classnames makes the data on the page computer-readable
* the problem she has at her company: it clashes with the existing CSS naming conventions
* is wondering: what alternatives are there?

Some additional issues that have come up in the past
* some developers remove the microformats classes because they appear to be "unused" since no CSS is being applied to them
* when looking at HTML source, developers (especially new developers) have no indication that a particular CSS class is used for microformats, unless they are already familiar with the microformats class prefixes

Schema.org different ways to publish onto a page but when rendered the output is the same
* adjecent object to represent the page 
*   there has been a recent discussion about a rel="alternate" to point at parsed Mf2 JSON
* the html-classes for mf2 is also a problem for Wordpress and themes

There are two ways of solving this:
* a different way to put the data in the page itself
* a way of linking to the same data in a different format

The data-attribute seems like a nice place to put it
* but: Data attribute was specified in HTML5 to be page-specific *ONLY* and *not* for external consumptions / formats

meta tag is not practical because it duplicates content already in the page

The problem with putting meta-information about your prefixes in the header of the page, is that people tend to copy+paste. And they only copy paste things that are in the visible body.

Another clash:
* the u-* prefix is used by some CSS frameworks as utilities (p-* also, sometimes, for padding)

You could add a new attribute: microformats="x"
* if that's true, parsers do not have to change a lot, only where to look for it
* w3c-validator says no to microformats="x"
* other attributes to highjack?
** property="x" - https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#state-and-property-attributes 
*** I believe this is referring to [[ARIA]] attributes, e.g. <code>aria-labeledBy="id"</code>. I think the RDFa spec is the intended reference: https://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/sources/rdfa-lite/#vocab-typeof-and-property. <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/3473/profile-2016-med.jpg}}  [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 12:27, 4 November 2018 (PST)

<pre>

<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/" />

<div class="h-entry"></div>
<div property="h-entry"></div>
<div property="mf:h-entry"></div>

</pre>

discussion on wether to prefix the microformats in the property attribute. "mf:h-card"?
* no: if we don't add any prefix, we can never clash with OG, but if we do, we might
