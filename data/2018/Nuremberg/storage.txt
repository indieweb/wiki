When: 2018-10-20 11:00

== Participants ==
* Jan Sauer
* Philip Saa
* Jeremy Cherfas
* Sebastiaan Andeweg (sebsel, seblog.nl)
* Calum Ryan (calumryan.com)
* Sebastian Lasse (sl007)

== Notes ==
* Philip got interested in YAML as a storage format. He was using XML before.
* Jan: XML has more options, but, writing by hand is really hard.
* Philip has a lot of steps to get from XML to HTML via JSON (in his Javascript framework), etc.
** He has one big file with all his site-content.
* Sebastiaan A. uses folders with files with 'Kirby Data' in it, which looks like YAML, but is more human friendly
** fields can contain real YAML too
** storage is in folders like /YYYY/ddd/n, with YYYY being the year, ddd being the number of the day in the year, and n being the number of post on the day. In that folder is an entry.txt.
** All the files are indexed in a sqlite database for better searching.
* JSON is valid YAML

* Jeremy is on Grav
* Grav (getgrav.org) uses YAML too, as YAML-frontmatter.
** YAML-frontmatter and then content in markdown, with a YAML part at the top of the file.
** You can add any fields you like in the frontmatter and they are available to the template.

* Jan wants to use event-sourcing
** is using MongoDB for storage, because of the way it can search
** wants to store the events (like 'PostCreated', 'PostUpdated'), of which he can derrive the current state of the 

* Sebastian Lasse wants to store lexical data as well
** wants a database that he can install for the user in one click
** Jan recommends ArangaDB

At this point aaronpk let the Google Hangouts join.

* Sebastiaan A. wants to use git for the event sourcing part
* Jan: that's nice, but you're not able to extract the exact 'Webmention' events. You are stuck with the format (aggregate) you get now.

* Nice thing about having multiple files (e.g. one per post) is that if you break one, the rest of your site still works.

* event sourcing is nice, but event driven architecture might be enough.
** post-content, external content (the page you mention) and incoming webmentions are different kinds of data and might deserve different kinds of storage.
