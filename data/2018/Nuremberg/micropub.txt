== Notes ==
[[Micropub]] is a way to get a unified way to create posts on your site.

Multiple sites can support it, multiple clients can support it, so other people can make apps that post to your site, and other's can use your apps.

{{aaronpk}} walks through how to sign in to Quill.

(this is really good. you should've been here)
