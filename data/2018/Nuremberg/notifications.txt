Services to deliver push notifications
* Pushbullet, Pushover
* They provide a UI for configuring how to deliver to multiple devices, and with what priority
* IFTTT offers notifications too via their platform app - but there's no control over which devices (it sends to all it's installed on)

Jan
* prometheus for notifications about server health
* CPU is too high, disk space is running out

Pushbullet has Oauth API:

Aaron: How can Aperture send notifications to people?
* using Pushbullet API, users can authorize Aperture to send notifications to their account
* give users a way to configure which channels in Aperture should send notifications to Pushbullet

Rose:
* Notifications can have URLs, so you can launch actions when you click on them
* These URLs can even be custom schemes, so you can open apps, or start iOS shortcuts / workflows
* Some providers (?) even make it possible to reply from the notification. You can send that reply via Micropub to your server.


How can apps like Indigenous deliver notifications?
* Indigenous needs to run a server to talk to Apple/Google notification service, but doesn't want to poll a Microsub channel
* A microsub server needs a way to have the app register for web hooks so the microsub server can deliver new posts to it
