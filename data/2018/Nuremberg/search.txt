== Notes ==

sl007 wants to know about searching
* in Mastodon you can search for hashtags, but that is limited
* sl007 wants a lexical index to search the text
* Mastodon doesn't let you search the public timeline
** There is no 'one public timeline' (there are multiple nodes)

* the Mastodon community does not like the hashtag-search
** it makes it too easy to find people you don't know, are not connected to

Aaronpk has indexed all his content in Elasticsearch
* it is it's own database, it's own service, not a distributed thing
* indiechat.search.cweiske.de also uses this to index the chatlogs

To have a full search on all the sites, you would have to centralize your search database
* You can distribute that central place, but it's not decentralized.

Aaronpk
* I want to find things I have seen before (like from reader-data)
* want to find new things
** start with the content from his social circle: find what friends have on that thing.
* Sven: you can ask your own database, and ask the API's of your friends for the same things.
** There is an [https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md#opensearch-response-elements OpenSearch specification]

Aaronpk does not want to participate in the global timeline
* The Global timeline is why people hate twitter.
* Mastodon's global timeline is still relative to the node you ask for it, and contains only what the node knows about.

Jeremy Cherfas
* wants to find things he has seen before, that he can remember
* How would I take something I know, and look for relative things other people he knows know
* aaronpk: we are limited in that we can only search for text, not for the concepts itself


The indieweb search engine
* go to your own search db
* go to your following page
* go to all the search dbs from your following
** private content would be the same problem as private feeds / would be handled by the same flow as discussed earlier today in the IndieAuth session

Open Search
