Either: add yourself to the guest list by '''[[Special:UserLogin|Logging in]] with your own domain''', or '''Publish a post saying that you're coming with a link to [https://indiewebcamp.com/2018/Nuremberg/Guest_List this RSVP page]''' and send a [[webmention]] to it.

| If you're in the process of setting up your personal site, or don’t have a personal site but want one, or want to create and contribute to the IndieWeb but don't know where to start, you’re still very welcome! Just sign up for a ticket, if you want to be listed here before the event talk to the organizer or ask the community in [[discuss|chat]].)
