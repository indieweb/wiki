== Notes ==
* Fear of live coding from some particpants (e.g. previous session with Aaron demonstrating Micropub) - Mrco complimented since Aaron was explaining as he coded.
* Interest in having a starterkit for IndieWeb
* Barrier of entry to basic steps even with some coding skills
* First you have get your own web server and domain which is challenge for non-backend expertise
* Time consuming process to implement from scratch when all you want to do is write content
* Jeremy Cherfas - remembers http://indiewebguides.org - {{calumryan}}
* Hosting options that are easily accessible - offering one package available on a hosted server which makes it easy get or have an existing domain. Making experience less scary / overwhelming. Minimally flexible.
* Setup preinstalled plugins of IndieWeb?
* Such a starterkit would be different per targetgroup. An artist has other needs then a journalist
* Observations - gathering people in events that draw in a group that is open and portraying welcoming enrionment that's diverse
* Journalist generations - reaching out to others to raise awareness
* First steps away from Facebook/Twitter or at least offer an easy and viable alternative that is your own instead of a closed silo.
* Maybe a need to raise awareness of concepts/primitives in IW that get beyond vague knowledge of open web which many only know of
* Enable people to things themselves
* Good side openess however downside of not knowing what direction to go in
* One of the issues that came up: How can you be ready for someone whos shows interest in being part of the open web/indieweb?
* Question on "When am I part of the Indieweb? When I have my own server with a CMS? Because I'm happy with my current hostingsolution". The most agreed upon answer would be: Have your own domainname. That's the way to get started. Then you can point it to anything and do whatever you want. 
* Overarching theme that comes back: First help someone articulate to know WHY they should investigate an alternative, after that show the HOW

== Ending suggestions for doing well with IW 
* Omnibear https://omnibear.com
* Blog Talk
* Just publish content
* WithKnown
* https://indieweb.org/Indigenous
* Give a talk about and write about IW for others
* Get next generation aware through modern media that engages younger people such as photos/video. Don't just focus on text. 
* How to Youtube videos with Aaron
* Reduce the use of the words "simple", "just..." and "easy". Get on the same level and help others forward.
