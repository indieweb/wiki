__TOC__
The '''<dfn>[[2018|IndieWeb Summit 2018]] session grid</dfn>''' is where notes and videos from all sessions can be found.

The session grid is developed on day 1, and is based on suggestions by the attendees.

All times are <strong>local</strong> times. If you are a remote attendee, make sure to [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180626T140000&p1=419 convert to your timezone].

The exact schedule is still TBD, the below is a placeholder until further notice.

== Saturday ==
Day 1: Share, Learn, and Discuss!

Session topics will be proposed and chosen on the day of the event and organized into a grid.

Sessions are facilitated by the participant who proposed the topic. Learn more at [[session facilitating]].

== Ideas and brainstorming in advance ==

* principles rewording and reorg: as it's been pointed out, the principles in their current form are aimed at internet long timer makers - eg. remember geocities? implies people in their 30s and thus might sound excluding to the younger - and should be made to be more inclusive both by getting rid of (most) technical terms and ancient references.

== Sunday ==
Work Sessions. Hack day. Build stuff and demo it!
