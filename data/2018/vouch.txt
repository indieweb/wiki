IndieWebCamp Summit 2018<br>
Session: Vouch<br>
When: 2018-06-26 15:55

== Participants ==
* {{GWG}} (facilitator)
* {{JackyAlcine}}
* {{martymcguire}}
* {{gRegor}}
* {{mblaney}}
* {{dougbeal}}
* {{martijnvdven}} (remote)
* ... add names

== Notes ==
Re-capped the [[Vouch]] protocol.

jacky: what if there was a service like webmention.io, vouch.io?

marty: This protocol doesn't really address the content of the Vouch URL. E.g. what if it's just gRegor liked this post, that doesn't mean much vs a more involved comment in-reply-to

{{martijnvdven}}: vouch can help surface "probably okay" comments in a moderation UI.

how to manage a list of "domains you trust" for incoming vouch URLs

* hand-managed list?
* a "following" list (e.g. from your indie reader or a blogroll)
** follow-of posts exist in the wild https://indieweb.org/follow
* a list of all domains i've sent webmentions to or mentioned on my site?
* members of a web ring

{{JackyAlcine}}: something like bridgy or granary? e.g. if i follow you on twitter, i will bubble this up.

{{martymcguire}} asked {{GWG}} what his blockers were for building this in WP:

* {{GWG}} How I trust people is not the same as other people
* 

Actions:

* Re-write /vouch without A, B, C so it's clearer to read. Generic people's names?
