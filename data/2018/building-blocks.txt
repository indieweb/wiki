== Notes ==
* Has everyone here logged in to the wiki and set up a user page? Yes
* {{t}} going through h-card and minimal h-card.
* Shows pin13.net, shows you the parsed JSON of your microformats; demos Firefox's collapsible view of 
* Shows indiewebify.me h-card validator.
* Does everyone have h-entry? Yes
* Next we will check that h-entry has good author information. Shows 2018.indieweb.org -- if your name or photo didn't show up here, we can fix that
* Pulls up [[rsvp]], shows minimal viable RSVP. Walking through the HTML to help Ryan set up an RSVP for [[2018]]
* Next up: [[reply]], shows minimal markup with u-in-reply-to mf2
* When replying to a tweet, even better if your syndicated tweet shows up threaded
* {{t}} shows his syndicated tweet with [[PSC]]
* Replies are probably one of the more important building blocks; this is how we interact across our sites.
* Showing [[reacji]], talking about [[Bridgy]] and [[Github]] integration
* Ryan's RSVP updated, webmentino sent, and now he's showing up on 2018.indieweb.org
** Photo wasn't showing up; debugged in pin13 and it shows an h-card photo property with an SVG, so it ''should'' work. Appears to be a consuming issue on the indieweb site.
** {{martymcguire}} files Github issue for this
** ... scratch that. Ryan appears to be missing the author property
** {{martymcguire}} discusses [[authorship]] and easiest way for Ryan to get it working: u-author property linking to "/" which will find the h-card on his homepage.
** After further debugging, appears 2018.indieweb.org is not correctly handling rel=author on Ryan's post. [[authorship testing tool]] finds the authorship information for the RSVP
