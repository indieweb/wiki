A goal is to discuss how to interact with a website through the physical world.

Derek has a NodeMCU micro-controller board. He wants to connect the microcontroller up to some light sensors to adjust the virtual world in the aframe.io framework.

https://google.github.io/physical-web/ has some ideas about how we can interact with the physical web.

We discussed the idea of building WiFi into a micro-controller so that you can have a bluetooth LE beacon where proximity can help you connect to the WiFi and then it can serve the webpage.

{{aaronpk}} discussed how his bar bot works.

Adam brought up saving time-series data, and if anyone in the IndieWeb has started working on that. {{aaronpk}} discussed the QuartzDB project and it's use in [[Compass]]/[[Overland]]

Talked about the idea about holding a smart phone up to different things with Bluetooth LE beacons to be able to fetch data from a device in front of you. For example, you could walk up to a 3d printer hold a smart phone up to it and get data from what the 3d printer is printing.

Discussed OBD ports on cars and using bluetooth interface to connect a car's diagnostic port to your smartphone. Things like https://www.automatic.com

Talked about a project where a group of people on a bike taps their right or left shoulder and then everyone's backpack's light up on either the right or left side to inform everyone which direction they are going. All the devices were done connecting to a smartphone's wifi hotspot, and a better form could be a mesh network, so they don't all need to connect to a hotspot.

Talked about the challenge of getting home automation working without the data leaving your house. One major issue was SmartThings which was difficult to deal with and their data always goes to the cloud.
