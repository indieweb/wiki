{{slideshow/start|Domain_Name}}

<div class="slide">
== Domain Name ==
* Get a domain name from a [[domain registrar]]
* Choose a [[web hosting|web host]]
* Now you have a place to put things
** your name, photo
** bio, portfolio
** blog posts, short microblog posts, photos
** anything else you want!
* Share your domain name with people
** If you change your mind and want to move hosting, or want to switch from Wordpress to a different CMS, people still know where to find you since you gave them a domain name instead of a Twitter profile

<div class="slide">
== Links to Other Profiles ==
* Link to where people can find you elsewhere on the web
** [https://aaronparecki.com/#relme aaronpk.com] [http://tantek.com/#recent-articles tantek.com] 
* such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Tumblr, Medium, etc
* Now you can use your website to log in to things, like our community wiki
** if you try to log in, it will ask for your domain name, then will give you ways to authenticate with other services like Twitter
* makes your website machine-readable

== Posting Blog Posts and Notes ==
* People often like to use their website to post blog posts and short notes, "microblog" updates

</div>

<div class="slide">
== Syndication ==
* You probably want other people to find your content
** You probably don't want to completely stop using Twitter or Facebook, since that's where your friends are
** Syndicating your content from your site to [[silo]]s is the best of both worlds, you own your data and you can still reach your friends where they are
* You can syndicate manually, by posting first on your site and then copying it to Twitter/FB
** You can automate the syndication using tools like [[Bridgy Publish]] or [[silo.pub]], or a Wordpress plugin like [[SNAP]] 
* Include the links to your syndicated copies on your original post

<div class="slide">
== Backfeed ==
Once your content is syndicated to other platforms, the next step is to bring the responses on those platforms back to your site.

[[backfeed|Backfeed]] is the process of bringing those responses back to your website. You can bring back the discussion from Twitter and Facebook back to your own website all in one place.

* [https://anomalily.net/the-cost-of-a-dream-train-trip/#comments anomalily.net] - comments from facebook, twitter
* [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/08/16/22/ aaronpk.com] - comments from facebook, instagram, micro.blog

Thankfully I don't need to write special code to handle Facebook and Twitter, since someone else did it for me!

[[Bridgy]]

Turns silo responses into webmentions! If you can accept webmentions, then you can start collecting your silo responses.

<div class="slide">
== Webmention ==
* webmentions enable your site to tell my site that you wrote a post that linked to me
* Microformats enable my site to extract the text from your comment
* This way, sites with completely different code bases can all work together, even static sites working with database-driven sites
* How to add Webmention support to your site
** Install a Wordpress plugin
** Use a service like [[webmention.io]]
** Use a CMS that already supports Webmention, like [[Known]]
* You can display received webmentions, or just keep them for your own review in an admin interface
** https://martymcgui.re/2017/12/24/182250/ - a podcast episode shows likes and comments
** https://aaronparecki.com/2018/01/16/12/ - a post with a reply from micro.blog

<div class="slide">
== Microformats ==
* Microformats give other computers a way to know which parts of the page are your post, or profile info, etc
* Microformats classes make a web page machine-readable without having to create a second copy of the data in some other format

Given a simple blog post like the below, you can add a few classes to make the page machine-readable.

<pre><article>
  <h2>Blog Post Name</h2>
  by <a href="/">Some Person</a>
  <img src="/images/featured.jpg">
  <div>Here is the blog post content</div>
</article></pre>

== Microformats ==
* Microformats give other computers a way to know which parts of the page are your post, or profile info, etc
* Microformats classes make a web page machine-readable without having to create a second copy of the data in some other format

Given a simple blog post like the below, you can add a few classes to make the page machine-readable.

<pre><article class="h-entry">
  <h2 class="p-name">Blog Post Name</h2>
  by <a href="/" class="u-author h-card">Some Person</a>
  <img src="/images/featured.jpg" class="u-featured">
  <div class="e-content">Here is the blog post content</div>
</article></pre>

The prefixes tell the parser where to get the value from.

That enables other computers to see the page as a nice clean data structure.

<pre>{
    "type": ["h-entry"],
    "properties": {
        "author": [{
            "type": ["h-card"],
            "properties": {
                "name": ["Some Person"],
                "url": ["https://example.com/"]
            },
            "value": "https://example.com/"
        }],
        "name": ["Blog Post Name"],
        "featured": ["https://example.com/images/featured.jpg"],
        "content": [{
            "html": "Here is the blog post content",
            "value": "Here is the blog post content"
        }]
    }
}</pre>

<div class="slide-footer">{{slideshow/next|h-entry}} building block [[Microformats]]</div>

<div class="slide">
== h-entry ==
A common Microformat you'll use is <code>h-entry</code>.

This represents a "[[post]]", any of the following kinds of posts will use <code>h-entry</code>:
* [[article]]
* [[note]]
* [[photo]]
* [[video]]
* [[bookmark]]
* [[checkin]]
* [[like]]
* [[repost]]

The different kinds of posts are created by defining new properties on the h-entry.

<div class="slide-footer">{{slideshow/next|h-card}} building block [[h-entry]]</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
== h-card ==
Another common Microformat you'll use is the <code>h-card</code>.

* An <code>h-card</code> describes a person, place or business.
* An <code>h-card</code> most often contains at least a '''name''', '''url''' and '''photo'''.
* An <code>h-card</code> can also contain additional information such as a bio, birthday

The simplest h-card is:

<pre><a class="h-card" href="/">Your Name</a></pre>

You can add a photo easily as well:

<pre><a class="h-card" href="/"><img src="/photo.jpg"> Your Name</a></pre>
