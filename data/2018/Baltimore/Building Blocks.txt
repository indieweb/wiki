The '''<dfn>Building Blocks</dfn>''' session is the second session of [[2018/Baltimore|IndieWebCamp Baltimore 2018]].

== Outline ==
=== Domain Name ===
* Get a domain name from a [[domain registrar]]
* put something on it like your name, photo, bio, etc

building block: [[home page]]

=== Links to Other Profiles ===
* Link to where people can find you elsewhere on the web
* such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Tumblr, Medium, etc
* Now you can use your website to log in to things, like our community wiki
** if you try to log in, it will ask for your domain name, then will give you ways to authenticate with other services like Twitter

building block: [[rel-me]]
* makes your website machine-readable

=== Posting Blog Posts and Notes ===
* People often like to use their website to post blog posts and short notes, "microblog" updates
* Here are some examples:
** https://aaronparecki.com/notes
** https://gregorlove.com/notes/
** http://snippets.bellebcooper.com/
** Note there is no title for these posts

building block: [[note]]

=== Syndication ===
* You probably want other people to find your content
** You probably don't want to completely stop using Twitter or Facebook, since that's where your friends are
** Syndicating your content from your site to [[silo]]s is the best of both worlds, you own your data and you can still reach your friends where they are
* You can syndicate manually, by posting first on your site and then copying it to Twitter/FB
** You can automate the syndication using tools like [[Bridgy Publish]] or [[silo.pub]], or a Wordpress plulgin like [[SNAP]] 
* Include the links to your syndicated copies on your original post

building block: [[POSSE]], [[posts-elsewhere]]
