{{slideshow/start|Domain_Name}}

<div class="slide">
== Domain Name ==
* Get a domain name from a [[domain registrar]]
* Choose a [[web hosting|web host]]
* Now you have a place to put things
** your name, photo
** bio, portfolio
** blog posts, short microblog posts, photos
** anything else you want!
* Share your domain name with people
** If you change your mind and want to move hosting, or want to switch from Wordpress to a different CMS, people still know where to find you since you gave them a domain name instead of a Twitter profile

<div class="slide-footer">{{slideshow/next|Links_to_Other_Profiles}} building block [[home page]]</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
== Links to Other Profiles ==
* Link to where people can find you elsewhere on the web
* such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Tumblr, Medium, etc
* Now you can use your website to log in to things, like our community wiki
** if you try to log in, it will ask for your domain name, then will give you ways to authenticate with other services like Twitter

* makes your website machine-readable

<div class="slide">

== Posting Blog Posts and Notes ==
* People often like to use their website to post blog posts and short notes, "microblog" updates
* Here are some examples:
** https://aaronparecki.com/notes
** https://gregorlove.com/notes/
** http://snippets.bellebcooper.com/
** Note there is no title for these posts

<div class="slide-footer">{{slideshow/next|Syndication}} building block [[note]]</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
== Syndication ==
* You probably want other people to find your content
** You probably don't want to completely stop using Twitter or Facebook, since that's where your friends are
** Syndicating your content from your site to [[silo]]s is the best of both worlds, you own your data and you can still reach your friends where they are
* You can syndicate manually, by posting first on your site and then copying it to Twitter/FB
** You can automate the syndication using tools like [[Bridgy Publish]] or [[silo.pub]], or a Wordpress plugin like [[SNAP]] 
* Include the links to your syndicated copies on your original post

<div class="slide-footer">{{slideshow/next|Webmention}} building blocks [[POSSE]] • [[posts-elsewhere]]</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
== Webmention ==
* webmentions enable your site to tell my site that you wrote a post that linked to me
* Microformats enable my site to extract the text from your comment
* This way, sites with completely different code bases can all work together, even static sites working with database-driven sites
* How to add Webmention support to your site
** Install a Wordpress plugin
** Use a service like [[webmention.io]]
** Use a CMS that already supports Webmention, like [[Known]]
* You can display received webmentions, or just keep them for your own review in an admin interface
