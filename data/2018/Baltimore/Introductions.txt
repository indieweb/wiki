== Demos Planning ==
Participants with established IndieWeb personal sites have an opportunity to coordinate their demos to show critical or compelling features. Add yourself and the feature(s) you plan to demonstrate below!

This list is in no particular order:

* {{aaronpk}} (not necessarily first) posting to my website from various Micropub clients (open to other suggestions based on what others will be demoing)
* {{gwg}} (in no particular order) will quickly demo posting to a site using Indieweb WordPress tools.
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} can demo a variety of things depending on other potential demos, I'm flexible: Weather in Posts, Posting using Indigenous (iOS share sheet), On This Day widget, holiday themes, media posts (watch/listen) and/or person tags come to mind. Open to other suggestions.
* {{gRegor}} can demo posting a note, using Bridgy Publish to syndicate to Twitter, and WebSub to see it appear in Woodwind (if the Woodwind gods are graceful at the time :)
* {{addyourself}}
