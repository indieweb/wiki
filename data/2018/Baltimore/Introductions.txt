# Announce: Welcome to IndieWebCamp Baltimore 2018!

=== gRegor Morrill ===
* {{gRegor}} https://gregorlove.com
* Showed home page, notes, briefly explained [[POSSE]] as a common indieweb feature
* Showed note publishing interface with text that I wanted to post and syndicate to Twitter
* Showed the "Syndicate to Twitter" checkbox on the form, submitted the form and it appeared on my site [https://gregorlove.com/2018/01/hello-from-indiewebcamp-baltimore/]
* Showed the "Tweet This" button that appears under the note (only for the logged-in admin). I usually use that button to semi-automate the [[Bridgy]] Publish of the tweet after confirming no typos.
* For this demo, though, I used the interactive publishing on [[Bridgy]] to 1) show Bridgy 2) show how it previews the tweet text and publishes it for you.
* Finally clicked through and saw it on Twitter [https://twitter.com/gRegorLove/status/954737194786312200]

== Demos Planning ==

Participants with established IndieWeb personal sites have an opportunity to coordinate their demos to show critical or compelling features. Add yourself and the feature(s) you plan to demonstrate below!

A few of us discussed our various site features and how showcase the most features in a (roughly) meaningful order. Here's what we have!

* {{gRegor}} - posting a note to his site. POSSE to Twitter via brid.gy publish with preview.
** {{martymcguire}} will immediately like / retweet / reply to his tweet on Twitter to give brid.gy time to backfeed
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} - load gregor's Tweet and respond using Indigenous. Maybe also the Watch features on his site.
* {{gwg}} - wordpress site. maybe plugins. weather per post feature.
* {{martymcguire}} - show gRegor's post w/ the backfed tweet. show event posts. audio posts on his site.
* {{aaronpk}} - checkins with OwnYourSwarm. OwnYourGram?

=== Older Planning ===

Volunteers in no particular order:

* {{aaronpk}} (not necessarily first) posting to my website from various Micropub clients (open to other suggestions based on what others will be demoing)
* {{gwg}} (in no particular order) will quickly demo posting to a site using Indieweb WordPress tools.
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} can demo a variety of things depending on other potential demos, I'm flexible: Posting using Indigenous (iOS share sheet), media posts (watch/listen), On This Day widget, Weather in Posts, <del>holiday themes and/or person tags</del> come to mind. Open to other suggestions.
* {{gRegor}} can demo posting a note, using Bridgy Publish to syndicate to Twitter, and WebSub to see it appear in Woodwind (if the Woodwind gods are graceful at the time :)
* {{addyourself}}
