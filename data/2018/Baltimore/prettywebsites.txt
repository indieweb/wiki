codrops contains some different styles that you can do to your websites: https://tympanus.net/codrops/
Some examples we looked at:
* clip-paths:  
* Glitch Effects: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/12/21/css-glitch-effect/
* Animated SVGs: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/11/15/animated-svg-frame-slideshow/
* https://css-tricks.com/gallery/
* nclud.com --> a DC-based creative agency

Derek shared some research regarding performance hits for doing this work -- things have changed given modern browser performance: 
*  CSS animations can be less CPU intensive rather than, say, js animation: developers.google.com/
* Csstriggers.com - helps to define what things get triggered with different css properties
* codepen.io --> has some great resources to draw from; Eddie shared that he solved his confetti for new years feature from inspecting some ideas at codepen.io
* wolfenstein3D in email example from codepen: https://codepen.io/M_J_Robbins/pen/XpQZOG

Cloth demo https://codepen.io/thomcc/pen/NGQpxv
Tearable cloth demo https://codepen.io/dissimulate/pen/KrAwx 

https://aframe.io/ - framework for making web-based openGL 3d and VR experiences

Discussing the differences between CSS and JavaScript with something like https://p5js.org

Great routes to get started with new approaches to CSS3 :
* https://www.w3schools.com/css/
* looking through examples and attempting to recreate them from scratch

Discussed the benfits of simple effects, like the languge transition on GitHub Repo pages: https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen

Russell shared a simple elegant use of CSS3 - theincline.com
Eddie shared a few light touches in Michael Bishop's page: https://miklb.com/

Debated the importance of Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality versus the Web. One important consideration being the difference between raising a device to view something and just seeing something like through a google glass like device.
