=== Update 1 ===
* date: 2018-01-16

Hello PERSONNAME! Only a few more days before we all come together for IndieWebCamp Baltimore! I am very much looking forward to the weekend, and I hope you all have a fantastic time while you're in Baltimore.

We still have a few spots left on the guest list, so invite a friend, co-worker, or two with a personal site (or who has said they want one!). They can register at https://2018.indieweb.org/baltimore

Here are a few last pieces of information before we meet. You may want to save this update so you can refer to it as you make your way to Baltimore for the festivities.

==== Weather ====

As of today, we're expecting clear skies, with temperatures should ranging between the low 30s into the 50s. This is a nice surprise, since Baltimore winters can be pretty chilly!

[[File:iwc-baltimore-2018-darksky-forecast.png]]

==== Pre-Camp Social ====

Friday evening we will be having a couple of optional pre-camp social events.

Beginning at 7pm, we'll have food and beverages at [http://joesquared.com/ Joe Squared]. Located at 33 W. North Ave., Joe Squared is an (excellent) pizza and risotto place in Baltimore's Station North. We will have a couple of high-top tables reserved under the name Marty McGuire in the front bar area.

At 9pm, attendees are welcome to see some improvised comedy with an IndieWeb bent during the BIG Mainstage Show at [http://www.bigimprov.org/ Baltimore Improv Group]'s BIG Theater. The BIG Theater is located at 1727 N. Charles St., two blocks east from Joe Squared. The show features BIG mainstage troupes Old City (which will open the show), and Hostel (of which Marty is a member). Mention that you're here for IndieWebCamp for free admission to the show!

==== General Schedule ====

Saturday will be a day of discussions. We'll begin with participant introductions and demos, followed by a tour of IndieWeb building blocks, and then session planning. We'll break for lunch on your own in Federal Hill. After lunch, the rest of the day is reserved for [https://indieweb.org/2018/Baltimore/Sessions discussion sessions] that will be proposed and led by participants like you! We'll wrap at 5:00pm for some social time.

Sunday is a making / hacking day - time to put some of those ideas from Saturday into action! New designs, add features to (or starting building) your personal website, and help others do the same. 

We'll have sponsored lunch brought in on Sunday, followed by more hacking. We'll close out with a round of demos before cleaning up and closing camp around 5:00pm.

You can find the [https://2018.indieweb.org/baltimore#schedule full schedule on the event website].

==== What to Work On? ====

Not sure what to work on at IndieWebCamp? Here are some ideas:

* making your site "you" on the web (working on your identity, domain, design)
* owning what you post (improving how you post to your site, how your posts look)
* reaching your friends, colleagues, co-workers (where to [https://indieweb.org/POSSE POSSE])
* owning your conversations (replying/liking/reposting from your site, and showing comments/responses to your posts, including [https://indieweb.org/backfeed backfeed] from POSSE copies)
