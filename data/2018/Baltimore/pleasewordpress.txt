Session: Please Develop IndieWeb WordPress Things With Me, I'm Lonely

When: 2018-01-20 15:05

== Participants ==
* {{gwg}} (Facilitator)
* {{jonathanprozzi}}
* Russell

== Notes ==

==WordPress Plugins==
* IndieWeb by Proxy
** There are several tools that allow you to syndicate (such as those designed by people aware of the community but not posted specifically as an IndieWeb community plugin)
** Tools/plugins fulfilling IndieWeb needs

* IndiWeb Community Plugins 
** Based on enhancing things that the community needs
** Webmention plugin: Easy. Installed, and then it happens!
** Post-Kinds: 
** Bridgy: This creates a user-interface for Bridgy. UI plugin. Bridgy problems should go to Bridgy
** IndieAuth: not updated in awhile, but david is working on it!
** Microformats2: If theme doesn't support microformats, it tries to do this with hooks/filters, but doesn't work as well.
*** Recommended to use an actual theme
** Simple location: Adds location support built in to WP
*** There was little interest in this in WP
*** Can add context to posts. Adds timezone support 
*** WP doesn't allow each post to have its own timezone. There is a system timezone on your WP installation
*** Saves the GPS data to the attachment post-type, but theres a need to add it to a post
*** Venue support? Defined but not implemented. Venues are a bookmark location. Location that exists by itself that can be related to a post
***Chris's Site: http://boffosocko.com/ demonstrates last shown location of post

==Ideas==
* Get my location button?
* GPS data from photos? 
* Would like to have the button on location to look somewhere other than the browser
* Timezone: Can set timezone of the plugin to the browser
** Automatically give me the timezone?

==What does the community need?==
* What is missing? 
** Token endpoint: this is something that {{gwg}} could work on this weekend
** Who is willing to write these things?
** More people that get involved the better it is
** Get involved with developers to contribute in various ways, such as unit tests
* IndieAuth and IndieWeb Plugin:
** Installer, but also has features related to identity
** Embeds the rel=me links into your header
** has an h-card widget and other rel=me widget if you don't want to write your own h-card
** there's lots that can be done to add to this (these are filed as Issues)
* Ideas are saved as issues, example:  https://github.com/dshanske/simple-location/issues

== Is there anyone else interested in building things for public sharing? ==
* Russell: Plans to turn static site into a dynamic site so could potentially be interested in it at this point
* {{gwg}} needs help with the UI of the plugins
** Looking to the future: what happens with Gutenberg transition? What will need to be updated/changed?

=What else is needed?=
* User feedback
* Documentation
* UI design for the plugins
* Explain from start to finish to use the plugins
* Example: webmention plugin has minimal settings, as do some of the others. Contribute feedback and feature ideas
* Extending the Getting Started features?
* Ideas and contributions?
* Can a plugin enhance itself?
** modifications to plugins to make them more community friendly
* Outreach!
** Spreading the word to those on WP who don't know about Indieweb
** Adding webmentions to WP Core? -> Support webmentions (suggested 2 years ago)
* Finding more people to contribute to the IndieWeb WordPress community
** How can we build engagement in a broader audience, how to tap into a large audience?

* IndieWeb WordPress Outreach Club
** This is where community plugins go
** active IndieWeb users/contributers who reach out to WP users to add IndieWeb community
*** https://indieweb.org/WordPress_Outreach_Club

* Overtime, each plugin has expanded so where are there still gaps? 
** will certain plugins be merged together?
** currently there are separate files for separate things. if merged, can have it that the webmention-receiver is a file, the sender is a file, etc.
* Is there a need for beginner tutorials, even though the plugins themselves are straight forward to use and handle a lot?  

* What handles microformats rendering? 
** Theme or Post-Kinds, or Micropub?
** Two plugins and a theme that can be doing the same thing -> design problem
*** More plugins that extend the WP language to help moving away from this issue

* How do we fill in more gaps?
** Theme vs. Plugin design problems in WordPress
*** WP thinks everything put on the screen is content
*** reply-to isn't content but WP thinks it is content. {{gwg}} solution: wraps original content as a low priority and then everything goes outside of it. but theme has to not put the content into the theme
** Blocks coming via Gutenberg
*** How will you do all this with blocks in Gutenberg?
**** Can always force everyone back into the classic interface

* What are the open issues on the IndieWeb Plugin?
