== Notes ==

There are many ways for websites to become "machine readable"
* RSS / Atom feeds
* meta tags like OpenGraph
* but why not just HTML, since it's already in the page?

Microformats way to be detailed in descriptions without requiring detail in parser
gregorlove.com/notes.atom
* redirects to granary.io 

Tools:
* Woodwind does native h-feed as well as XML
** Can login with site and subscribe to gregorlove.com and it finds the h-feed
* Bridgy Publish:
** reads microformats in order to create the publish on twitter/fb/etc.
** Bridgy has to be able to understand the context and uses microformats markup for this purpose
    
http://php.microformats.io/
* microformats.io has links to parsers for all different languages

Shows example of simple h-entry, with p-name, e-content, dt-published.

Added a minimal h-card to the same page.

How to add author info to the entry without duplicating the h-card info on the page?

There are many ways to do this, so there's a whole [[authorship]] algorithm.

e.g. - Add a "u-author" link with no text content. That becomes a URL. When resolving the author later, detect that that's a URL and fetch and parse that page for an h-card.

A challenge: a multi-user blog has posts with images. Wants them to show up as "featured" image but the users don't want to manage adding mf2 classes to the image tag.
* CMS could add the u-featured class to an image. Could also add "u-featured" to a wrapper element of the image, since parsers will dig down. Could also add a hidden copy of the image with the class.

Main resources?

* microformats.org looks dated but stays up-to-date
* microformats.org/wiki/h-entry is a reference for what we've been looking at

Note with location (p-location) vs. check-in (u-checkin).
* locations can be multiple types. h-geo, h-card, h-adr, ...

looking at aaronparecki.com in the parser (https://php.microformats.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faaronparecki.com%2F)

Inoreader (an RSS reader) supports h-feed

Difference between v1 and v2 of microformats?
