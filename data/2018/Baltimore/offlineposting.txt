Session: Offline Posting

When: 2018-01-20 13:15

== Participants ==
* {{gRegor}} (session facilitator)
* Matt
* Derekt
* {{jonathanprozzi}}
* Darius
* {{chrisaldrich}}
* {{addyourself}}

== Session Overview ==

* The session is about offline posting. Being able to write a post or notes offline and then post to a site/CMS when reconnected.
** Could be his own site, or a method for posting to any site or CMS

=== Goals ===
* Be able to open site that doesn't require connectivity and start typing notes
* Ideal would be having an auto-save in this state
* Could be used for offline collaboration
* Could this be a service? 
** Connect a micropub service: Login, type offline into an interface such as Quill, and then it preserves it until you're connected 
** Does Quill have this?
* Maybe a progressive web app?
* Store in local storage in browser? 
* An inactive save feature could be useful
* Focused primarily on mobile app/service for this
* Be as plaintext as possible
** Plaintext with tagging
*** Hierarchy of tags?
* Don't want it to be cumbersome while capturing the content of the notes
* Tags emerge when needed: default would be a 'blog' or a 'general' if not tagged, but then if needed could add a tag in to classify
* Start simple and always iterate

=== Ideas/Resources ===
* Progressive Web App with service workers to do this
* Matt: Has tried lots of apps and tools for this process:
** Early 2000s: Single page wiki (notes wrapped in an HTML file).  --> [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)
*** This gave lots of speed to populate content into categories and then it was a single file
*** This could be offline. When wanting to use collab features it got really tricky
*** Single tool features work well but when he starts integrating collaboration, it starts to fall apart
*** a current favorite in terms of an effortless UX - [Agile Tortoise Drafts](https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) (not as capable as Taskpaper and various other tools, but has never failed me)
*** important for Matt has been that the notes themselves and all significant features are always wrapped up in plaintext-readable markup
* Jonathan: I like the workflow of writing in Markdown locally when offline and then pushing to github OR CMS when live
** Issue: Wouldl be nice to have this for mobile! Computer is cumbersome for this, but effective
* And useful resource for ios text editors (fairly comprehensive, longterm project): Brett Terprstra (creator of [Marked](http://marked2app.com/) markdown preview tool) [iTextEditors chart]()http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/)
* Putting lots of work into a specific note that is a prelude for a later post * how does this relate to the later output
* Should be able to always have a fresh note when you open something and then save it for later
** Older notes would be preserved until deleted

=== Tools ===
* Drafts: iOS, Android, Desktop. 
** Always starts with a new note, and when you close the app it auto saves and tucks it away
** This has been useful for his lifestyle but has still found certain things lacking
** Saves locally? Saves to cloud?
** Nice interface for accessing drafts
** Google Keep, works offline on mobile (maybe not on desktop)
*** Google Keep Chrome App: DOES save offline notes and should pull offline notes when connection is reestablished
*** Links notes to sites via Google account
* [[NoterLive]] does a pretty good job of saving notes in the browser (local storage) in case the app crashes or problems occur prior to posting
* SimpleNote: multi-platform software kind of like Evernote, Google Keep. Plaintext focused. Might be rewritten with offline capabilities (need to confirm)
** Matt uses this - There is a way to sync with them but could also sync with other tools
** update from review of https://simplenote.com/help/#syncing -- can write offline, and any action that creates, edits, deletes, or accesses the note when online potentially syncs it
* {{chrisaldrich}} I'll often use bookmarking tools and [[IFTTT]] workflows ([[PESOS]]) to trigger things quickly on the go that create drafts with timestamps that I can later update/publish when I'm back online.
** Example: [https://ifttt.com/applets/70758150d-if-any-new-public-bookmark-by-chrisaldrich-then-create-a-post-on-your-wordpress-blog Diigo] and [https://ifttt.com/applets/43279553d-reading-am-feed-creates-wordpress-blog-draft Reading.am]
*** [[Reading.am]] allows me to post via email and then IFTTT picks it up via RSS and posts a draft read post
***  [[Diigo]] also allows direct integration to IFTTT to pick up posts there to PESOS as bookmarks and or pick up annotations later.
* WordPress has the ability to post via [[email]], so one could draft a post in email and send it that way when later connected (pseudo-offline)
** https://en.support.wordpress.com/post-by-email/
* Day One:
** Mac Tool (OS X, IOs) - Is there a way to syndicate this to a site, possibly via XML?
** Start writing, and then it pulls info and preserves it for later

=== TODO ===
** What can we do today that will allow us to build something specific tomorrow?? **
* Does Quill have an offline writing feature?
** it preserves drafts
** Would be nice if one could draft something via email while offline and send it to Quill or another endpoint for processing and ultimate posting via [[micropub]]
Questions:
* Is context information important for the notes? 
** Title + Body for POC, possibly timestamp
*** Example: Gregor listening to a podcast while traveling and wanted way to preserve this for later reflective post/note online
* How to save the datetime for the post? What should the datetime be? The drafting time or the ultimate posted later time?
* Are we writing plaintext into the app or HTML?
* Formatting: do we want sequential posts or is it a scratch/draft for later revision/reflection? 
* How many pieces would we be writing?
** Gregor's usecase would be few times a year since he'd usually be connected (except during flights, travels) 
* If using hashtags to tag and classify, how to identify?
** Fewer and more precise if for a specific project
** Could be more general for blogging
** Build ontop of Quill as starting point?
*** Extend the offline/draft features present in Quill -> Ability to save more than 1 draft note at a time
*** Does Quill populate hashtags as they're typed?
*** Email to Quill for processing/posting?
* Does Etherpad also work offline?
** no, it doesn't. one of the other similar projects might tho (e.g. hackpad)
