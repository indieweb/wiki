Questions:
    
{{t}}: I would like to serve my pages from my current website, with alternate links to e.g. dat and ipfs URLs/hashes, so anyone loads my site in a local network, then anyone else in that local network can get (preferably) that content locally rather than re-retrieving it from my server

Disaster preparedness (RINA)

Objectives

Use of language is important. Need to be more inclusive with the language we are using.

There are tons of things in the world are important, the indieweb is concerned with some specific things, and that's ok. Personal websites, how they can talk to each other.

{{jimpick}}'s Dat Demos: (come ask me for a personal demo!)
* https://dat-quick-publish.glitch.me/ (one click publishing to dat)
* https://dat-shopping-list.glitch.me/ (online/offline multiwriter dat - multiple devices/users)
* https://dat-tiddlywiki.glitch.me/ (multiple writers, merging)
