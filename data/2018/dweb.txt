Objectives

Use of language is important. Need to be more inclusive with the language we are using.

There are tons of things in the world are important, the indieweb is concerned with some specific things, and that's ok. Personal websites, how they can talk to each other.

Jim Pick's Dat Demos: (come ask me for a personal demo!)
* https://dat-quick-publish.glitch.me/ (one click publishing to dat)
* https://dat-shopping-list.glitch.me/ (online/offline multiwriter dat - multiple devices/users)
* https://dat-tiddlywiki.glitch.me/ (multiple writers, merging)
