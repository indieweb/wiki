== Notes ==
https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts

Tumblr pioneered different content types

Stories - https://indieweb.org/story

Instagram as a source of design patterns
* primacy of the image
* a little bit of social decoration
* see people browsing through images on Instagram
* sometimes there's long blocks of text / stories attached to their images. e.g. guy running through Italy, it's his blog

Lily's example of anomalily.world - showed a subset of her indieweb posts, the map to the photos

irakli: perhaps the consumer of the content can choose how to see it, example of beaker/dat where the code to view it can be forked separately from the data

The [[reader]] can show photos vs articles

What about map posts?

Google doesn't always have the 7 attributes of maps


https://indieweb.org/map - could be improved

https://sebastiangreger.net/2018/05/self-hosting-maps-control-privacy-ux/
* "don't embed google maps, because you are enabling privacy exposure of your users"


* tos;dr
* js;dr - https://indieweb.org/js;dr

javascript problems - provides too much access to local information, allows tracking of all keystrokes, or heatmap tracking

UI for putting content out into the world
e.g. Medium

https://indieweb.org/create for examples
