<!-- Things discussed and shown off during the demo session of [[2018|IndieWeb Summit 2018]], in order of presentation. -->

== Chris Aldrich ==
* {{chrisaldrich}}
* helped other people a lot.
* gets more itchy from the IRC chat room
* created a new post kind to track his [[itches]]
* indieweb.org is another silo he doens’t want to depend upon for his itches
* using flames as icon for ithces “burning desire”
* For {{martijnvdven}}’s sake a completely new itch-of property!
* And a separate itch-feed to subscribe to
* “is an itch post completed by a scratch post?”

== Jonathan LeCour ==
* {{cleverdevil}} shows [[Indiepaper]]
* If you have a micropub compatible site, indiepaper can submit read-later posts to it
* is using [[Aperture]] for it, aperture has a special feature where it creates [[Micropub]] endpoints for channels
* Showing of the read-later bookmarklet
* Clicks it on a page
* Switches to [[Together]] and shows a new article in his readlater channel
* All general social interactions from within the reader will work
* https://indiepaper.cleverdevil.io
* Any old micropub works, but microsub is nicer (and more complicated to explain)

== Eric Drechsel ==
* https://edrex.pdxhub.org/
* Patch for [[Perkeep]], a backend storage system, written years ago
* New query system for metadata of the files
* So you can write something like an SSG on top of the perkeep file storage
* Showing the commands for querying an image right now
* Getting a hash first, that hash can then be used to do things. Running a oneline to “do it all at once”
* Shows the metadata coming up
* Next step, feeding it into something like [[Metalsmith]]

== Ryan Barrett ==
* {{snarfed}}
* asking for a round of applause for all the people running organisation
* starts on the [[reader]] wiki page
* talking about how nice decoupling readers and servers is
* talking about how there are many feed fetching “silos” already
* Holding up [[NewsBlur]] as example
* https://baffle.snarfed.org
* Using Cloudflare in front
* CDN can run code for you on the nodes to keep work off of your own servers
* Worker takes [[Microsub]] requests and translates them to newsblur api calls, and translates the response back
* More commandline and curling!
* curling the newsblur endpoint on baffle
* Showing the output in [[Together]]
* Successful prototype

== Lillian Karabaic ==
* {{anomalily}}
* did one of those things that “looks really simple”
* but involved a lot of “getting {{GWG}} to fix things”
* Shows the weather at her latest location in her footer
* [[Checkins]] now show pictures. Previous checkins went through [[IFTTT]], now straight from indieweb stack
* Only problem: no titles on the checkins anymore

== gRegor Morrill ==
* {{gRegor}}
* Worked on [[indiebookclub]]
* The [[Micropub]] client for everything you are interested in reading
* Now has query-string support that allows you to prefill fields in the form
* This will enable to creation of things like bookmarklets
* It is all on the documentation page
* Also joined the indiewebwebring

== Nolan ==
* https://boundary.me
* Packaging up [[WordPress]] with IndieWeb plugins and small config
* To run on the [[Raspberry Pi]]
* Reason this is interesting is the user experience
* Unzip a file on the Raspberry Pi, go to the “store”, get WordPress and it is all done
* Hosting with SSL etc
* your own domain can point to the Raspberry with a CNAME
* Nolan is now logged in to the Raspberry Pi. Sadly you still have to go activate the plugin manually
* Also comes with an IndieWeb friendly theme
* And the plugin shows the entire process of what you can do and steps to follow

== Malcolm Blaney ==
* {{mblaney}}, https://unicyclic.com
* project for the day changed a few times
* discussion this morning around authorization endpoints. Decided that would be fun to implement in half a day
* Demoing login to [[Monocle]]
* Shows the redirect to his own authorization endpoint
* Has a continue button to login to Monocle
* talking to his own reader, [[dobrado]]
* Yesterday had a talk about [[Microsub]], so can continue with the Monocle login flow
* Now Monocle is pulling the feed data from his own reader on his own site
* Should match up with the public reader on unicyclic
* “hopefully they are in sync”
* Checking to see if it matches up. Doesn’t loook pretty in Monocle yet, but seems to get all the posts
* authorization endpoint challenge included a free copy of {{aaronpk}}’s book!

== Manton Reece ==
* {{manton}}
* Worked on a couple of things
* he noticed a [[micro.blog]] user tried [[indiebookclub]], but nothing happened
* indiebookclub sends a summary as fallback for endpoints that do not understand read-of
* micro.blog now supports fallbacks!
* For [[OwnYourSwarm]] was using indieauth.com rpeviously for micro.blog users
* But that is annoying
* So now micro.blog is its own [[IndieAuth]] endpoint
* a lot simpler for the users this way

== Jamey Sharp ==
* https://jamey.thesharps.us/
* Worked on writing issues on other people’s projects
* Did a PR on [[Together]], was merged in
* Links to original posts now open in a new tab

== Grant Richmond ==
* {{grantcodes}}, https://grant.codes
* demoed his theming in the intros
* It now works in more browsers than just Chrome
* Easteregg: you can keep the theme icon pressed to enter rainbox mode
* Worked on a site: “micropub example posts”, http://examples.tpxl.io
* Shows the rendered HTML for post types, the HTML, and the parsed JSON
* For all sorts of post types
* There is also a link for an [[h-feed]] to test readers with
* There is also more error reporting in [[Together]]. “That should be useful.”

== Jim Pick ==
* {{jimpick}}
* Wanting to merge IndieWeb stuff with [[Dat]] stuff
* Landing page asks for a name
* It can then publish a personal page on Dat immediately
* using the hashbase service, the Dat page is also available on the internet, https://jim-pick-indieweb.hashbase.io/ (URL is no longer live as of 2018-09-29)
* Got it working 5 minutes before demos.

== Sebastian Kippe ==
* https://sebastian.kip.pe
* Likes to publish what city/country he is in at any given time
* Used [[Swarm]] with webhooks
* Swarm broke the API, and will not be supporting it any longer (at least not for free users)
* Now uses [[OwnTracks]]
* Sends to [[Huginn]]
* Not entirely finished, working on a system that will automatically post to a website when he enters a new city

== Johannes Ernst ==
* {{j12t}}
* Wants to make [[Together]] installable with 1 command on [[UBOS]]
* Shows the JSON config needed to install Together, very little configuration
* https://github.com/jernst/ubos-together

== Greg McVerry ==
*  {{jgmac1106}}
* been working with the question: how to onboard students and teachers
* wants to make remixable syllibi
* Because everyone is teaching the same courses online
* learning CSS grids at the same time, http://edu307syllabus18summer.jgregorymcverry.com/
* On his own website, he took [[Post Kinds Plugin]] to recreate his twitter feed
* Added not 1, but 2 [[webrings]]
* Found a WP plugin for webrings

== AJ Jordan ==
* {{strugee}}
* Does not know how to use cords
* Bugged him that spec.indieweb.org didn’t have anything
* Went to the whatwg page and stole their HTML
* Created a github repo with that HTML linking to all the indieweb specs
* And pinged {{aaronpk}} to put it online
* Also worked on [[lazymention]]
* Will crawl your website and send webmentions for them
* Which allows static sites to send webmentions
* Interesting server error that would crash the whole thing: apparently false does not equal true
* Last thing he did was adding pretty job urls
* in theory the server would start, take a frontpage URL, and return a nice URL to see what is happening
* The URL is accessible, shows it is in progress, and shows the number of pending webmentions
* Eventually the page will say it has completed the task

== Michael Toomin ==
* https://invisible.college/@toomim
* Was at the filtering/algo session yesterday
* Thought he knew how to do it, so built a prototype
* Lots of content on the IndieWeb, but hard to filter and rank it, unlike silos
* Shows https://invisible.college/@toomim/indierep
* Bunch of posts that can be sorted by scores
* Can drag “people” around in the scoring
* Anything with a URL can be filtered and sorted
* Can grab posts from all over
* Lowering Caleb’s score
* All the scores you set are available at a URL
* Scores can be pulled from all over the place, because published scores at a URL can be imported by anyone
* Maybe someone makes a function that filters cat photos, then you could pull that in
* Or filter out people with political biases. Ot see the oposite of what you normally see.
* For discovery: people can make groups
* Groups can be rated, e.g. rate up the indieweb group to surface everything indieweb people are writing

== Jack Jamieson ==
* {{jackjamieson}}, https://jackjamieson.net
* Got “one very small job” done
* Recently started adding [[read]] posts, but wanted to keep them separate
* Filtered them out on his theme, and added a reading page separately
* Started working on a microsub-server-as-a-wordpress-plugin
* Started with the micropub plugin, and find&replaced micropub for microsub
* Mixed results. But surprisingly good.
* Can now login to [[Monocle]], and it will give an error message
* But it isn’t the first error, he has been through a few!
* Thanks to {{mblaney}} for advice

== Doug Beal == 
* {{dougbeal}}
* Got his website fully migrated (he showed half migration during intro)
* [[IndieAuth]] suddenly started working, because Authorization headers are no longer being stripped
* Did a [[read]] post, and a [[checkin]]
* Proud member of two [[webrings]]!
* As a finale: ... Taking his site offline
* Docker files https://github.com/dougbeal/docker-dougbeal.com.git

== Marty McGuire ==
* {{martymcguire}}, https://martymcgui.re
* Now feels like he needs to end his demo by taking his website down
* Worked on a little project
* New project on [[Glitch]]
* He wants to question the fact that we rely on domain names
* Lots of problems, DNS, domain names, don’t always align
* "I dunno, this DNS thing sounds like a fad to me" - {{martymcguire}}
* https://🕸.ws
* The problem is clearly visible because they mess with the webring . ws domain name
* Can add himself automatically to the indieweb ring
* webring uses hashemoji to create a unique emoji for everyone
* next and back links are real, not random at all (even though he gets different pages every time) [lots of laughter]

== Irakli ==
* Wanted [[Webmention]] to work on [[Dat]]: DatMention
* Copying a URL from [[Webmention.rocks]]
* Demos how [[Beaker]] works with writing things
* Post showed up on webmention.rocks
* Created the Dat content into the archive he selected through Beaker
* Had to write a mirroring tool because none of the tools support Dat
* Has a [[Glitch]] proxy that makes it available to the HTTP webmention endpoint
* Would like us to update tools to talk other protocols

== Ryan Johnson ==
* https://iambismark.net
* Worked on basic building blocks

* And has been building a plugin for [[Vouch]]es

* Also launched {{strugee}}’s HTML on spec.indieweb.org

* What he was really excited about are the new [[IndieAuth]] servers: [[micro.blog]] and [[dobrado]]
