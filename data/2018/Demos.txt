[01:13:43 [2018-06-28]] <+Zegnat> aaronpk, will not be going first (because it may ruin a surprise *gasp*)
<+Zegnat> ‚ÄúWe have dongles. For things.‚Äù
<+Zegnat> Yes please for names and websites :D
<+Zegnat> [chrisaldrich] first up
<+Zegnat> helped other people a lot.
<+Zegnat> gets more itchy from the IRC chat room
<+Zegnat> created a new post kind to track his itches
<+Zegnat> indieweb.org is another silo he doens‚Äôt want to depend upon for his itches
<+Zegnat> using flames as icon for ithces
<+Zegnat> ‚Äúburning desire‚Äù
<+Zegnat> For {{martijnvdven}}‚Äôs sake a completely new itch-of property!
<+Zegnat> And a separate itch-feed to subscribe to
<+Zegnat> ‚Äúis an itch post completed by a scratch post?‚Äù
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty It's demo time!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRrRsrBeXC)
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty Chris Aldrich is out here with his new post type to handle itches!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRrRvZeSDP)
<+Zegnat> cleverdevil shows indiepaper
<+schmarty> zegnat++ for demos!
<@Loqi> zegnat has 105 karma in this channel (247 overall)
<+Zegnat> If you have a micropub compatible site, indiepaper can submit read-later posts to it
<+schmarty> (for notetaking, i mean!)
<+Zegnat> cleverdevil is using aperture for it, aperture has a special feature where it creates micropub endpoints for channels
<+Zegnat> Showing of the read-later bookmarklet
<+Zegnat> Clicks it on a page
<+Zegnat> Switches to [[Together]] and shows a new article in his readlater channel
<+Zegnat> All general social interactions from within the reader will work
<+schmarty> Indiepaper: https://indiepaper.cleverdevil.io/
<+Zegnat> indiepaper.cleverdevil.io
<+Zegnat> Any old micropub works, but microsub is nicer (and more complicated to explain)
<+Zegnat> Searching for correct screen dongle ... take the black one, usually works
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Jonathon // http://cleverdevil.io just unveiled http://indiepaper.cleverdevil.io that works as a IndieWeb-powered Instapaper.
<@Loqi> Using tools like Aperture and Together will help you use this!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRrkfhdTqQ)
<@Loqi> [@cleverdevil] Just demoed Indiepaper, my read-it-later service for the IndieWeb. Check it out - https://indiepaper.cleverdevil.io (http://twtr.io/1fRrm6wnv9s)
<+Zegnat> Who is up?
<+jalcine> like awake?
<+Zegnat> No, like, demoing :P
<+Zegnat> No name/url
<+Zegnat> Patch for perkeep, a backend storage system, written years ago
<+Zegnat> New query system for metadata of the files
<+Zegnat> So you can write something like an SSG on top of the perkeep file storage
<+jalcine> oh I was going to ask that too re: name tbh
<+Zegnat> (schmarty, it is ‚Äúperkeep‚Äù, I am assuming?)
<+jalcine> https://perkeep.org/
<+Zegnat> I am pretty good, but I am not an over-the-internet-mind-reader. So I don‚Äôt magically know who is demoing. Sadly
<+jalcine> ;)
<+schmarty> zegnat, jalcine ^^ all correct
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty We got a patch for perkeep // https://perkeep.org/ that allows for more simpler static-site generation.
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRrzKActRN)
<+schmarty> Eric is demoing. one sec and i'll get his user page
<+Zegnat> Thanks!
<+Zegnat> Showing the commands for querying an image right now
<+Zegnat> Getting a hash first, that hash can then be used to do things. Running a oneline to ‚Äúdo it all at once‚Äù
<+Zegnat> Shows the metadata coming up
<+Zegnat> Next step, feeding it into something like [[Metalsmith]]
<+schmarty> it was
<+schmarty> Eric Drechsel
<+Zegnat> snarfed coming up, asking for a round of applause for all the people running organisation
<+GWG> Sorry, Zegnat for the noise
<+Zegnat> Noise? Clapping is fine, only podium mic is on
<+schmarty> (Eric is https://edrex.pdxhub.org/)
<+Zegnat> Awesome, thanks schmarty!
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty Ryan starts his demo by giving props to the organizers. Truly needed since everything is just moving!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRsChVXYuQ)
<+Zegnat> snarfed starts on the reader wiki page
<+Zegnat> talking about how nice decoupling readers and servers is
<+schmarty> jalcine: i seem to be caught in your note boat on Twitter üòÇ
<@Loqi> [@erima] Had a great time at #D4DBoston  today. @adactio bringing the indieweb vibe, @redfinsolutions, @oomphinc, and @LastCallMedia had great presentations. (http://twtr.io/1fRsHTjbnHL)
<+jalcine> it's so bad
<+jalcine> and I don't know why it happens
<+Zegnat> talking about how there are many feed fetching ‚Äúsilos‚Äù already
<+Zegnat> Holding up NewsBlur as example
<+jalcine> it's this cross "toot"/tweet thingy
<+Zegnat> baffle.snarfed.org
<+schmarty> computers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<+Zegnat> Using Cloudflare in front
<+Zegnat> CDN can run code for you on the nodes to keep work off of your own servers
<+Zegnat> Worker takes microsub requests and translates them to newsblur api calls, and translates the response back
<+Zegnat> More commandline and curling!
<+Zegnat> curling the newsblur endpoint on baffle
<+Zegnat> (someone check with snarfed that baffle can go linked on the wiki! schmarty, gRegorLove)
<+Zegnat> Showing the output in [[Together]]
<+Zegnat> Successful prototype
<+schmarty> he says sure!
<+Zegnat> next up [anomalily]
<+Zegnat> did one of those things that ‚Äúlooks really simple‚Äù
<+Zegnat> but involved a lot of ‚Äúgetting GWG to fix things‚Äù
<+Zegnat> Shows the weather at her latest location in her footer
<+Zegnat> Checkins now show pictures. Previous checkins went through IFTTT, now straight from indieweb stack
<+Zegnat> Only problem: no titles on the checkins anymore
<+Zegnat> next up gRegorLove
<+Zegnat> Worked on indiebookclub
<+Zegnat> The micropub client for everything you are interested in reading
<+Zegnat> Now has query-string support that allows you to prefill fields in the form
<+Zegnat> This will enable to creation of things like bookmarklets
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Ryan bridging services like NewsBlur into platforms like Together. This pulls in silo platform feeds in conjunction to our readers.
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRson1VKnC)
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty Lily got changes to show more check-in info  and weather on her site.
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRsoq6an7j)
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty Gregor is showing off IndieBookClub // http://indidebookclub.biz - similar to Goodreads and/or @reading
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRsosn7pyQ)
<+Zegnat> It is all on the documentation page
<+Zegnat> Did a second thing
*** Mode #indieweb +v snarfed by Loqi
<+Zegnat> He joined the indiewebwebring
<+jalcine> iwwr
<+jalcine> I just see webweb and think of WWW from Megaman lol
*** Mode #indieweb +v jackjamieson by Loqi
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty @reading Also highlighting the creation of the IndieWeb Web ring!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRsvUiCAoY)
<+Zegnat> Nolan up next. boundary.me [?]
<+Zegnat> Packaging up WordPress with IndieWeb plugins and small config
<+Zegnat> To run on the RPi
<+Zegnat> Reason this is interesting is the user experience
<+Zegnat> Unzip a file on the RPi, go to the ‚Äústore‚Äù, get WordPress and it is all done
<+Zegnat> Hosting with SSL etc
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Nolan is showing a pre-packaged version of Wordpress that's IndieWeb-forward designed for small devices.
<@Loqi> Once it's online, it's available and ready to be IndieWeb-friendly.
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRt28WM5M6)
<+Zegnat> ( üï∏üíç is the correct way of writing webring, btw, jalcine)
<+jalcine> lol TIL
<+jalcine> might need a wiki disambiguation page
<+Zegnat> your own domain can point to the raspbary with a CNAME
<+Zegnat> Nolan is now logged in to the RPi. Sadly you still have to go activate the plugin manually
<+Zegnat> Also comes with an IndieWeb friendly theme
<[cleverdevil]> Super cool!
*** Mode #indieweb +v [cleverdevil] by Loqi
<+Zegnat> And the plugin shows the entire process of what you can do and steps to follow
<+[cleverdevil]> I may host a few sites at home on a Pi using this once its done.
*** Mode #indieweb +v [cleverdevil] by Loqi
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty @reading Nolan also added a IndieWeb-friendly theme so that it's less coding for you!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRtFXUCKZM)
<+Zegnat> Next up malcolm
<+Zegnat> unicyclic.com
<+Zegnat> project for the day changed a few times
<+Zegnat> discussion this morning around authorization endpoints. Decided that would be fun to implement in half a day
<+Zegnat> Demoing login to Monocle
<+Zegnat> Shows the redirect to his own authorization endpoint
<+Zegnat> Has a continue button to login to Monocle
<+gRegorLove> talking to his own reader, [[Dobrado]]
<+Zegnat> Yesterday had a talk about Microsub, so can continue with the Monocle login flow
<+Zegnat> Now Monocle is pulling the feed data from his own reader on his own site
<+Zegnat> Should match up with the public reader on unicyclic
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty @reading Malcolm here is demoing his home-grown authorization endpoint on https://unicyclic.com/
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRtUoG9QLG)
<+Zegnat> ‚Äúhopefully they are in sync‚Äù
<+Zegnat> Checking to see if it matches up. Doesn‚Äôt loook pretty in Monocle yet, but seems to get all the posts
<+Zegnat> authorization endpoint challenge included a free copy of aaronpk‚Äôs book!
<+Zegnat> next up [manton]
<+Zegnat> Worked on a couple of things
<+Zegnat> he noticed a micro.blog user tried indiebookclub, but nothing happened
<+Zegnat> indiebookclub sends a summary as fallback for endpoints that do not understand read-of
<+Zegnat> micro.blog now supports fallbacks!
<+Zegnat> (note to self: document in mf2 wiki)
<+Zegnat> For OwnYourSwarm was using indieauth.com rpeviously for micro.blog users
<+[eddie]> manton++ !!!! micro.blog IndieAuth provider!! üëè üëè üëè
<@Loqi> manton has 47 karma in this channel (52 overall)
<+Zegnat> But tht is annoying
<+Zegnat> So now micro.blog is its own indieauth endpoint
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Manton is up and shows how you post from IndieBookClub to https://micro.blog.
<+[cleverdevil]> manton++ Awesome work!
<@Loqi> Also https://micro.blog is an IndieAuth PROVIDER!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRtojxiLKC)
<@Loqi> manton has 48 karma in this channel (53 overall)
<+Zegnat> a lot simpler for the users this way
<+[eddie]> Looks like it‚Äôs time for me to go update my ‚ÄúIndieAuth‚Äù explanation for Micro.blog to say ‚ÄúNatively supported‚Äù
<+[cleverdevil]> That's a big deal. Lots of additional users for IndieAuth, overnight.
<+[eddie]> HUGE deal!
<+Zegnat> Now we just need lots of more services that consume indieauth! But they are coming, I hope :D
<+Zegnat> (stuck in 640x480 xD)
<+Zegnat> Who is this?
*** Mode #indieweb +v jackjamieson by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Worked on writing issues on other people‚Äôs projects
<+Zegnat> Did a PR on Together, was merged in
<+Zegnat> Links to original posts now open in a new tab
<+Zegnat> next up {{grant.codes}}
<+[cleverdevil]> That was https://jamey.thesharps.us/
<+Zegnat> demoed his theming in the intros
<+Zegnat> It now works in more browsers than just Chrome
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Grant's up with more extensions to his site's themeing options and a little easter egg - _RAINBOW MODE_ lol
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRu2eEGY01)
<+Zegnat> Easteregg: you can keep the theme icon pressed to enter rainbox mode
<+Zegnat> Worked on a site: ‚Äúmicropub example posts‚Äù
<+Zegnat> examples.tpxl.io
<+Zegnat> Shows the rendered HTML for post types, the HTML, and the parsed JSON
<+Zegnat> For all sorts of post types
<+Zegnat> There is also a link for an h-feed to test readers with
<+Zegnat> There is also more error reporting in [[Together]]. ‚ÄúThat should be useful.‚Äù
<+Zegnat> grant.codes++ Always useful!
<@Loqi> grant.codes has 1 karma
<+Zegnat> grantcodes++
<@Loqi> grantcodes has 4 karma in this channel (24 overall)
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Grant also made a site that shows examples of MicroFormats 2 JSON and HTML for the page as well. Helpful if you wanna test readers or MicroPub clients.
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRu9yM2hv6)
*** Mode #indieweb +v jgmac1106 by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Next up Jim Pick
<+Zegnat> Wanting to merge IndieWeb stuff with DAT stuff
<+Zegnat> Landing page asks for a name
<+Zegnat> It can then publish a personal page on dat immediately
<+Zegnat> using the hashbase service, the DAT page is also available on the internet
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Jim Pick is out here demoing a tool on @glitch that lets you automatically make IndieWeb sites on IPFS! Really nifty.
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRuGsW1rdf)
<+Zegnat> Got it working 5 minutes before demos.
<+Zegnat> Sebastian Kippe
<+Zegnat> sebastian.kip.pe
<+Zegnat> Likes to publish what city/country he is in at any given time
<+Zegnat> Used [[Swarm]] with webhooks
<+Zegnat> Swarm broke the API, and will not be supporting it any longer (at least not for free users)
<+Zegnat> Now uses [[OwnTracks]]
<+Zegnat> Sends to [[Huginn]]
<+GWG> Owntracks for Android is abandoned, alas.
<+Zegnat> Yeah, I looked into that too, GWG :(
<+GWG> Zegnat: GPS Logger?
<+Zegnat> Not entirely finished, working on a system that will automatically post to a website when he enters a new city
<+Zegnat> GWG, I wanted to run OwnTracks, but ended up taking petermolnar‚Äôs advice for a different app. Name escapes me, will check when I pick up phone
<+Zegnat> Next up: ... the person who build ubos
<+gRegorLove> j12t
<+gRegorLove> Johannes
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Sebastian is demoing his real-time actions (namely location) initially using Foursquare's Swarm but moved to OwnTracks so it's a lot easier!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRucSyL4ks)
<+Zegnat> please take a step to the podium ...
<+Zegnat> Wants to make Together installable with 1 command
<+Zegnat> Shows the JSON config needed to install Together, very little configuration
<+Zegnat> https://github.com/jernst/ubos-together
<+Zegnat> jgmac1106 up next
<+Zegnat> been working with the question: how to onboard students and teachers
<+Zegnat> wants to make remixable syllibi
<+Zegnat> Because everyone is teaching the same courses online
<+Zegnat> learning CSS grids at the same time
<+Zegnat> On his own website, he took Post Kinds to recreate his twitter feed
<+Zegnat> Added not 1, but 2 webrings
<+Zegnat> Found a WP plugin for webrings
<+Zegnat> Next up strugee
<+Zegnat> Does not know how to use cords
<+Zegnat> (Thankfully we are on IRC and not on Discord, he.he.he.)
<+Zegnat> Bugged him that spec.indieweb.org didn‚Äôt have anything
<+gRegorLove> Hahah
<+Zegnat> Went to the whatwg page and stole their HTML
<[chrisaldrich]> Zegnat++ for live updates on irc, it feels like I haven't really left yet
<@Loqi> zegnat has 106 karma in this channel (249 overall)
*** Mode #indieweb +v [chrisaldrich] by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Created a github repo with that HTML linking to all the indieweb specs
*** Mode #indieweb +v [chrisaldrich] by Loqi
<+Zegnat> And pinged aaronpk to put it online
<+Zegnat> Also worked on [[LazyMention]][
<+Zegnat> Will crawl your website and send webmentions for them
<+Zegnat> Which allows static sites to send webmentions
<+Zegnat> Interesting server error that would crash the whole thing: apparently false does not equal true
<[wiobyrne]> These updates are awesome. Need to go back later and review the video and grab links.
<+Zegnat> Last thing he did was adding pretty job urls
<+Zegnat> in theory the server would start, take a frontpage URL, and return a nice URL to see what is happening
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è AJ's up and ported over the standards of IndieWeb to a friendly page (soon to be available on the main site).
<@Loqi> ANDD he made some improvements to lazymention, a service for static sites to send out WebMentions (trust me - this is a blessing of a service)
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRvHefPUrC)
<+Zegnat> ([wiobyrne] theoretically I will go through all these logs on the wiki and add the links where neccessary_
<+Zegnat> The URL is accessible, shows it is in progress,and shows the number of pending webmentions
<+Zegnat> Eventually the page will say it has completed the task
<+Zegnat> [chrisaldrich], glad you get some use out of me writing :D
<+Zegnat> Nex tup ...?
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty @reading @glitch There's new UX for handling job information too!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRvQEnGQp4)
<+Zegnat> Was at the filtering/algo session yesterday
<+Zegnat> Thought he knew how to do it, so built a prototype
<+Zegnat> Lots of content on the IndieWeb, but hard to filter and rank it, unlike silos
<+Zegnat> Bunch of posts that can be sorted by scores
<+Zegnat> Can drag ‚Äúpeople‚Äù around in the scoring
<+Zegnat> Anything with a URL can be filtered and sorted
<+Zegnat> Can grab posts from all over
<+Zegnat> Lowering Caleb‚Äôs score
<+Zegnat> All the scores you set are available at a URL
<+gRegorLove> (This is Michael Toomin [sp?])
*** Mode #indieweb +v marclaporte by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Scores can be pulled from all over the place, because published scores at a URL can be imported by anyone
<+Zegnat> Maybe someone makes a function that filters cat photos, then you could pull that in
*** Mode #indieweb +v jackjamieson by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Or filter out people with political biases. Ot see the oposite of what you normally see.
<+Zegnat> For discovery: people can make groups
<+Zegnat> Groups can be rated, e.g. rate up the indieweb group to surface everything indieweb people are writing
<[wiobyrne]> Thanks a ton Zegnat++
<+Zegnat> next up jackjamieson
<+Zegnat> Got ‚Äúone very small job‚Äù done
<[wiobyrne]> A valued service!!!
<+Zegnat> Recently started adding read posts, but wanted to keep them separate
<+gRegorLove> jackjamieson.net
<+Zegnat> Filtered them out on his theme, and added a reading page separately
<+Zegnat> Started working on a microsub-server-as-a-wordpress-plugin
<+Zegnat> Started with the micropub plugin, and find&replaced micropub for microsub
<+Zegnat> Mixed results. But surprisingly good.
<+Zegnat> Can now login to Monocle, and it will give an error message
<+Zegnat> But it isn‚Äôt the first error, he has been through a few!
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è We got Jack // http://jackjamieson.net/ up with a new "read" post on his site by way of IndieBookClub // http://indiebookclub.biz
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRvxnozRWg)
<+Zegnat> Thanks to unicyclic for advice
<+gRegorLove> {{mblaney}}
<+Zegnat> Got his website fully migrated (he showed half migration during intro)
<+Zegnat> IndieAuth suddenly started working, because Authorization headers are no longer being stripped
<+Zegnat> Did a read post, and a checkin
<+Zegnat> Proud member of two web rings!
<+Zegnat> As a finale: ...
<+Zegnat> Taking his site offline
<+Zegnat> Now schmarty feels like he needs to end his demo by taking his website down
<+Zegnat> Worked on a little project
<+Zegnat> (and forgot to open with his name and URL ;))
<+Zegnat> New project on [[Glitch]]
<+Zegnat> He wants to question the fact that we rely on domain names
<+Zegnat> Lots of problems, DNS, domain names, don‚Äôt always align
<+gRegorLove> "I dunno, this DNS thing sounds like a fad to me" - {{martymcguire}}
<+Zegnat> The problem is clearly visible because they mess with the webring . ws domain name
*** Mode #indieweb +v j12t by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Can add himself automatically to the indieweb ring
<+Zegnat> webring uses hashemoji to create a unique emoji for everyone
<+Zegnat> next and back links are real, not random at all (even though he gets different pages every time)
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è Marty // @schmarty is up and thinks DNS is a thing of the PAST!
<@Loqi> Also is on the IndieWeb WEB RING!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRwQaNSbim)
<+Zegnat> Lots of laughing, but I don‚Äôt know what that was about, sadly. Something about schmarty smashing his laptop? :P
<+jalcine> nah close
<+jalcine> it's moreso about web rings
<+jalcine> but like it not being "random"
<[dougbeal]> https://üï∏.ws
*** Mode #indieweb +v [dougbeal] by Loqi
<+[dougbeal]> All the docket files https://github.com/dougbeal/docker-dougbeal.com.git
*** Mode #indieweb +v [dougbeal] by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Thanks [dougbeal], that will save me from looking for links
<+jalcine> lol
<+Zegnat> Next up ... someone who wanted webmention on Dat.
<+jalcine> +üíØ
<+Zegnat> Copying a URL from webmention.rocks
<+jalcine> agh no reacji on IRC
<+gRegorLove> (showed up for me. all depends on irc client)
<+Zegnat> Demos how beaker works with writing things
<+Zegnat> Post showed up on webmention.rocks
<+Zegnat> Created the dat content into the archive he selected through beaker
<+gRegorLove> (This is Irakli [sp], missed the URL)
<+Zegnat> Had to write a mirroring tool because none of the tools support Dat
<+Zegnat> Has a glitch proxy that makes it available to the HTTP webmention endpoint
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty @reading @glitch We got a demo of sending WebMentions over the DAT protocol.
<@Loqi> So it's ... DATMENTION lol
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRwjtoufVx)
<+Zegnat> Would like us to update tools to talk other protocols
<+Zegnat> (I would like to point out that the tools do not even do HTTP2. So good luck getting on Dat.)
<+Zegnat> Next up ..?
<+Zegnat> Worked on basic building blocks
<+Zegnat> Was updating his blog with vim and rsync
<+gRegorLove> Ryan Johnson, iambismark.net
<+Zegnat> Can now use Quill to post
<+Zegnat> Shows off multi-party uploads through micropub.rocks
<+Zegnat> excited about the progress he made
*** Mode #indieweb +v jackjamieson by Loqi
<+Zegnat> s/multi-party/multi-part/
<+Zegnat> (although multi-party sounds good too!_
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è @t @schmarty @reading @glitch We got a live demo of someone getting MicroPub via Quill to send posts on their site!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRwxqjuR8H)
<+schmarty> http://üï∏üíç.ws is the link to my project above btw
<tantek__> up next: Lovi
*** Mode #indieweb +v tantek__ by Loqi
<+tantek__> went from zero to IndieWeb
<+tantek__> 36 hours ago had no website
<+Zegnat> Webmention did not work quiet out of the box.
<+Zegnat> (I am assuming WordPress?)
<+jalcine> err I think so
<+Zegnat> From having seen Lovi in the Blue Room today ;)
<+tantek__> yes I believe so
*** Mode #indieweb +v [schmarty] by Loqi
<+Zegnat> Generated some content this morning
<@Loqi> [@jackyalcine] ‚Ü©Ô∏è We got a talk-through from Lovi of how a Gen 4 got themselves to make a Indie RSVP for this year's summit!
<@Loqi> All done with BeaverBuilder!
<@Loqi> #iws2018 #indieweb (http://twtr.io/1fRxB56tbML)
<+Zegnat> Today got the homepage. able to use ... beaverbuilder?
<+gRegorLove> lovi.star.is
<+Zegnat> Aah, jalcine knows whats up :D
<+Zegnat> Thanks guys, I had no sound here
<+tantek__> Lovi++
<@Loqi> lovi has 1 karma
<+jalcine> going to investigate - I think aaronpk is on it
<+Zegnat> Next up. The man himself. The great. GWG
<+gRegorLove> Lovi++
<@Loqi> lovi has 2 karma
