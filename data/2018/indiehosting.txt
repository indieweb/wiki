== Notes ==

* Nolan kicked off discussing email as a particular topic for self-hosting. Working on a project to make it easy to self-host email at home, using an old laptop or Raspberry Pi.
** Why? Privacy / protection. Incentive to "monetize" you as a user disappears. Even if privacy isn't a concern, over time, you'll get a better experience.
** Its tempting to over-focus on privacy. There are other important advantages, e.g.:
*** long-term archival
*** personal analytics
** Nolan brought up targeting even "generation five" people  -- post PC people who primarily rely upon their mobile device and may not even own a computer
* Big questions:
** What about internet connectivity loss? Nolan wants a system that will handle that gracefully so that the user doesn't have to worry about it.
** What apps? In what order?
** What about ISPs blocking?
*** Generally speaking, ISPs are fine with it as long as its for "personal use," otherwise they want you to use their business internet services.
** What about email specific issues like block lists and spam?
** For mail delivery? Nolan has set up a TCP proxy on a known-clean IP.
