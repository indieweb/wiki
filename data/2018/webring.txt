https://indieweb.org/webring

What is a web ring?
* dougbeal: a series of links between web pages that take you around in a loop
* gRegor: used one on geocities. was centralized, so you'd sign up and they would give you a snipped to put on your site
* jgmac1106: did the hashtag replace the web ring?
** dori: a hashtag takes you to a post, not a person
** macgenie: the one-a-time nature leads to a different kind of discovery

We link to https://hotlinewebring.club/
* gRegor: this one is pretty new, 2016 or 17

{{anomalily}}: webrings.org was bought by Yahoo and it broke their management tools. Yahoo required webrings to have a Yahoo account to be the "ringmaster", and it gave admin rights to the first person with a Yahoo account that logged in! Several webrings died because the original admins couldn't get them back.
* owner of the site eventually got it back, too late.
* "Yahoo killed webring ringmasters. Don't be Yahoo."

Important parts:
* forward
* backward
* random buttons
* breaking the ring (by not putting the links on your site) got you booted
* the ringmaster was really in control of which sites were in the ring, what orders they go in.
** anomalily maintained a pretty-boys-in-bands web ring. also part of a "i didn't go to prom" web ring, which was really interesting to flip through.
** its very discovery-oriented, like blogrolls.
** search killed this kind of discovery because it became so much easier to find things.
** but now google controls what we see with their algorithms. bringing back things like web rings would give us control over our journeys through the web.
** this could also be used for bad things, of course. "web ring of people who pirate TV shows"

Dori: usually an affinity group

Jared:
* are we setting up a webring here?
* or developing some indieweb protocols?

anomalily:
* making webrings cool again is probably very different from making them work on top of IndieWeb building blocks

macgenie / anomalily: web rings are a fun hole to spend time in. a kind of alternative to the dopamine refreshing for new posts on facebook.
* micro.blog has micro monday - long post recommending one new person to follow, in opposition to "follow friday" which is are scattershot posts full of names with no reasons why they're interesting.

anomalily: being part of an affinity network outside of google could help define/engage with audience who reads her site.
* has a "part of the indieweb" in the footer of her site. would rather have that be links to other people.

sidebar on web counters. and whether they're accurate.
* other suspected shady "realtime" info

jgmac1106 is looking for webrings in the wild and only finding archives.
* found an old WP Camp Webring plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-camp-webring/ (updating 5 years ago)
** it has a hardcoded list of URLs in it https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-camp-webring/trunk/wp-camp-webring.php
https://wordpress.org/plugins/draupnir-ringmanager/

** it was "a webring of people who attend the wpcamp in germany. Like it's 1997."

gRegor pulls up the story of tilde.club, a throwback to 80s/90s-style web hosting on unix systems.
