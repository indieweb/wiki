== Sessions ==
If you will be participating in the Day 0 Leaders Summit, please add your session ideas here with name, hashtag, and session idea name. Please add nested list-items with "+1 yourname" for sessions you want to participate in!

See [[2017/Leaders#Sessions|Last Year's Sessions]] or [[2016/Leaders#Sessions|2016 Sessions]] for ideas. The global [[Leaders]] page has a running list of [[Leaders#Issues|issues]], some of which are very long-standing.

=== New ideas ===

==== IndieWeb principles split and reorg ====
'''Proposer:''' {{jgmac1106}}, 2018-04-18 [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=2018/Leaders&diff=prev&oldid=46971]
* in order to have more inclusive, gen2-3-4 friendly indieweb descriptions, the idea to reorganize the principles had come up, starting from most gen4 oriented downwards to gen1 oriented.
** {{tantek}}: Start more modest, just rephrasing to be inclusive of gen2. Then get gen2 folks to help write a gen3 friendly version. It is highly unlikely that gen1 folks will be able to write effectively for gen3+ (too different a perspective).

'''Interested:'''
* {{petermolnar}}
* {{addyourself}}

==== Re-evaluate sponsorship policy ====
'''Proposer:''' {{aaronpk}}, 2018-04-19 [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=2018/Leaders&diff=next&oldid=47014]

* Currently we have a bunch of links in the footer from hosts from several years ago. Might want to consider a more formal/strict policy of when those fall off the page and are only shown on the specific event page.

'''Interested:'''
* {{addyourself}}

==== non-profit organization ====
'''Proposer:''' {{aaronpk}}

{{aaronpk}}: As the community grows, having a formal organization could benefit us in a few ways. There has been some talk in [[discuss|chat]] of a "bug bounty" program or having a fund to support individual projects. While I don't think IndieWeb itself should become a formal organization, there is definitely an opportunity for other individuals to form adjacent organizations to handle things. 

examples:
* [https://rubytogether.org/ Ruby Together] "Ruby Together is a grassroots initiative committed to supporting the critical Ruby infrastructure you rely on"

related discussion:
* http://fionavoss.blog/2018/05/11/68541
* https://micro.blog/manton/554671

'''Interested:'''
* {{addyourself}}

==== Overlap Between GitHub Communities ====
'''Proposer:''' {{martijnvdven}}

There is currently an odd overlap between the GitHub organisations [https://github.com/microformats/ <code>microformats</code>] and [https://github.com/indieweb/ <code>indieweb</code>].

'''Interested'''
* {{martijnvdven}}
* {{addyourself}}

'''Notes'''
* The PHP parser is a project of the IndieWeb organisation, while the Python one is under the Microformats organisation. Is this just a legacy thing? Where would future projects go?
* Is there a magical point where we will ask projects to move their repository under one of the organisations?
** This goes back to a point {{GWG}} made on “how to decide what belongs” to the community.

==== prep for keynotes tomorrow ====
'''Proposer:''' {{aaronpk}}

{{aaronpk}}: We should spend a little time prepping/rehearsing for keynote demos the next morning, to make sure the demos are snappy and to the point and don't take up a ton of the morning time. Last year I think we were a little too rambly in the morning without making a clear point.

=== 2017 Next Time ===
From: [[2017/Leaders#Task_List]]

* Discussion channels
** add bridged -meta
** keep wiki edits in -dev
** add bridged -wordpress
** update #indiechat topic to direct people to #indieweb-chat
* Logos
** consensus they're a good idea
** need to be well-designed, consistent
** used in footers of websites, github, icons, stickers
* Community Repos
** new criteria for moving in (and possibly moving out) repos to (and from) the indieweb org repo on GitHub
** have adaptable thresholds for projects that might need the extra nudge (and that do not allow much plurality anyway) like WP plugins
** aaronpk will look at his repos and possibly move things out. Put out a call to others to look at their repos to?
* organize next iterations on Nov 3 (before IWC Berlin)

'''Interested'''
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

=== Discussion Channels ===
{{aaronpk}} [[2017/Leaders#presenting|Last year]] we decided to formalize expanding the set of #indieweb discussion channels. Let's evaluate how this has been working and whether we should add more or not, as well as consider which channels the automated content belong in.

'''Interested'''
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{martijnvdven}}
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

'''Existing channels summary'''
* #indieweb - general user-centric discussion bridged with Slack #???
* #indieweb-dev - developer specific discussion, implementation/protocols/formats/plumbing focused things bridged with Slack #dev
** Wiki edits also go here
* #indieweb-wordpress - WordPress-specific both user-support, and IndieWeb Pluging / Core development related
* #indieweb-meta - discussion about the channels, the community, etc
* #indiechat - existing informal not deliberately logged channel
* #indieweb-chat - informal channel bridged with Slack #chat
Other Freenode channels logged by Loqi because they're symbiotic with the #indieweb community:
* #microformats
* #bridgy
* #knownchat

'''which channel for wiki edits'''
* The wiki edits can be kind of noisy especially when there is a conversation happening. Would it make sense to have a special channel for wiki edits? Maybe move everything to #indieweb-meta?

'''which channel for WordPress development'''
* There has been a little discussion about this again lately. As the appeal of the WordPress plugins is growing, more non-gen1 people turn up to #-wordpress looking for help setting things up. To not alienate these people, development talk has shifted back into #-dev.
* User support is nice in #-wordpress, as the main channel is mostly active with gen1-type people on their own custom workflows who can be of little help to WordPress setups. The people who do run WordPress are probably in #-wordpress and happy to help there.
* WordPress plugin development, especially if multiple devs are online, can quickly fill up all of #-dev. This was one of the original reasons there was a fork into #-wordpress: [[2017/Leaders#Discussion_Channels]] so we should stick with that. If there's a need for separate WP channels for WP users vs WP devs, we can consider that.

=== Code of Conduct Review ===
While reviewing [[code-of-conduct|our code of conduct]] and others, {{aaronpk}} realized others have concrete steps and contact info for addressing CoC violations, such as an email address or phone number to report to. e.g. Mozilla's [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/ Community Participation Guidelines] that they asked us to abide by for IndieWeb Summit has a "Reporting" section.

'''Notes'''
* Merged notes from [[Leaders#Issues]]:
** {{chrisaldrich}}: One of the pieces missing from it is an ombudsmanish contact/enforcement mechanism or a means of helping to resolve issues. Usually at Camps we mention up front who to contact or converse with privately if someone has an issue? How would that/could that be done in our online space? Or at least doing so in private if someone had difficulty in speaking up. I suspect Gen2+ folks may have even bigger issues for contacting leadership for resolution depending on their level of technical ability. Who would they contact and how? Privately at least? ([https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Leaders&diff=next&oldid=39099 original wiki edit])
*** [[code-of-conduct-feedback#Contact_Information|Long standing feedback]], don’t let this turn 2 years old!
*** [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2017-07-14#t1500069166660000 Chris reminding us in chat.]
*** For IWC, specify how CoC should be brought up. Make sure organisers remember to point out contacts. Maybe update [[IndieWebCamps#How_to_organize|IWC: How to organize]] with this?
* The physical events have gotten better at pointing out who to contact, often pointing out several people. It makes a lot of sense to extend this to our online presences.
* As stated in [[Leaders#Issues|the list of running issues]], it may be important to give people a way to ''privately'' contact someone. Saying to take up issues on chat with whoever is an IRC Op is probably not a good solution for such a thing, especially with private messaging not bridged between Slack and IRC.

=== future meetings ===
{{aaronpk}}: we should discuss what it might look like to have more regular meetings like this, potentially even completely online, because:
* there is a very long list of sessions here, and it's likely we won't have time to go in depth on everything
* we've been talking about things like the chat channels for months without feeling like we can do anything about it until this meeting
* most of the participants here are remote anyway

{{martijnvdven}}: I think we discussed doing it quarterly, or at least three times a year aligning with major IWCs, at the last Leaders Summit. This still makes a lot of sense to me. Though maybe it has been failing because planning an actual get together the day/night before an event is hard, and we should decouple it from the “major IWC” mark?

=== IndieWeb Community Infrastructure ===
Proposer?!?

Currently the IndieWeb (as an organisation) is using several services, but it is not always clear who to contact about which part. It may be good to compile a list of third-parties that are depended upon, and who the contacts are for those.

Possible discussion points, taken from [[Leaders#Issues|the running issues]]:

* What services are essential for running the IndieWeb community resources, and who has access to them?
** Content
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[wiki]] [https://github.com/indieweb/wiki available on GitHub].
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[discuss|chat]] logs [https://github.com/indieweb/indieweb-chat-archive available on GitHub].
** Domain name(s)
*** Who has access to <code><nowiki>indieweb.org</nowiki></code>, can configure the DNS, etc?
*** How can access to these be split amongst several people?
** Communication
*** Who can manage the [[Slack]] server / channels?
*** Who can manage the [[IRC]] channels?
**** It looks like we have several <code>+o</code> people. Are they all listed as Founders or equal on ChanServ?
***** All 5 [[discuss#Chat_Channels|chat channels]] list {{benthatmustbeme}} and {{aaronpk}} as Founder. (Checkable by writing <code>/msg ChanServ INFO #indieweb</code> in your IRC client.)
**** all ops are in US timezones and thus not available on EU mornings (discussed 2017-12-17 due to small spam-wave on Freenode)
**** Is there anything to gain from [https://freenode.net/groupreg registering with Freenode]? (or has this been done already?)
*** Is there any managing we have to do for the [[Matrix]] bridge?
*** How quickly could a new Slack bridge be created if [[Loqi]] goes down? The bridge code is [https://github.com/aaronpk/Slack-IRC-Gateway available on GitHub].
** Official channels
*** Again, who has access, and what are the backups?
*** There is an official [[Twitter]]: [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp]
*** There is an official [[GitHub]]: [https://github.com/indieweb/ IndieWeb]
** For projects we depend on, e.g. the Slack bridge, should they be mirrored to the indieweb GitHub account? That way the community has them even if the original author decides the remove their repository.
** Third parties we depend on? Can more of these be self-hosted?
*** Currently the wiki login only works through [[IndieAuth.com]].

''' Notes '''
* On 2018-05-01 [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-05-01/1525186645668800 several] [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-05-01/1525190543567300 people] brought up [https://www.voidlinux.eu/news/2018/05/serious-issues.html the issues faced by Void Linux]. Here the “project leader” “disappeared”, leaving things like DNS and GitHub uncontrollable by those still in the community.
* The wiki documents IndieWeb [[expenses]]. [[opencollective|Open Collective]] has a separate track of [https://opencollective.com/indieweb#expenses IndieWeb expenses]. These offer a glimpse of the services IndieWeb is paying for, but may not show the complete picture either.
