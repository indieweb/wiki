=== 2017 Next Time ===
From: [[2017/Leaders#Task_List]]

* Discussion channels
** add bridged -meta
** keep wiki edits in -dev
** add bridged -wordpress
** update #indiechat topic to direct people to #indieweb-chat
* Logos
** consensus they're a good idea
** need to be well-designed, consistent
** used in footers of websites, github, icons, stickers
* Community Repos
** new criteria for moving in (and possibly moving out) repos to (and from) the indieweb org repo on GitHub
** have adaptable thresholds for projects that might need the extra nudge (and that do not allow much plurality anyway) like WP plugins
** aaronpk will look at his repos and possibly move things out. Put out a call to others to look at their repos to?
* organize next iterations on Nov 3 (before IWC Berlin)

'''Interested'''
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

=== Discussion Channels ===
{{aaronpk}} [[2017/Leaders#presenting|Last year]] we decided to formalize expanding the set of #indieweb discussion channels. Let's evaluate how this has been working and whether we should add more or not, as well as consider which channels the automated content belong in.

'''Interested'''
* {{aaronpk}}
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

'''Existing channels summary'''
* #indieweb - general user-centric discussion bridged with Slack #???
* #indieweb-dev - developer specific discussion, implementation/protocols/formats/plumbing focused things bridged with Slack #dev
** Wiki edits also go here
* #indieweb-wordpress - WordPress-specific both user-support, and IndieWeb Pluging / Core development related
* #indieweb-meta - discussion about the channels, the community, etc
* #indiechat - existing informal not deliberately logged channel
* #indieweb-chat - informal channel bridged with Slack #chat
Other Freenode channels logged by Loqi because they're symbiotic with the #indieweb community:
* #microformats
* #bridgy
* #knownchat

'''which channel for wiki edits'''
* The wiki edits can be kind of noisy especially when there is a conversation happening. Would it make sense to have a special channel for wiki edits? Maybe move everything to #indieweb-meta?

=== HWC Organizing ===
HWC is a specific events organizing use-case that's worth discussing / solving before the global events discussion. How has this been working since last year?

Proposer: 

Interested:
* …

Problems we should solve:
* Late to announce cities
* Late to cancel cities
* Late to post indie events
* Late to post silo events (FB, Meetup)


=== Events Organizing ===
Let's discuss how to improve how we organize IndieWeb related events, including in particular a/the website for events.

'''Interested'''
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

'''New Events Website?'''
* More notes: [[events#Brainstorming|brainstorming]]

'''Incremental Improvements?'''

'''Some events seem to avoid the wiki'''

=== Site Refresh ===
In [[2016]] we discussed a major site-update and completed at least part of it for the start of the main IndieWebSummit! Followed up with a larger update on 2016-07-04.

Shall we do another site refresh? Or at least parts thereof?

'''Interested'''
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

'''Home page'''
* Consider what do other community / standards sites provide on their home page, and do we see things there that resonate or otherwise indicate areas we could improve our own home page? (and then list them below this site list) E.g.:
** https://ietf.org/
** https://www.w3.org/
** https://nodejs.org/
** https://wordpress.org/
** https://withknown.com/
** https://mozilla.org/
* '''mission statement''' Do we need one? (see above examples) Do we already have one? (if so, [[mission statement]] should explicitly state it and expand upon it)
* '''short intro video''' nearly every other such "modern" community or project has a short video intro embedded directly on their home page. we could use that, but we may want something a bit more properly edited / finessed than just a talk recording.
* ... more suggested changes to the homepage based on comparative analysis with other sites

'''About'''
* Similar to home page but perhaps expands upon the community identity etc.? E.g. see:
** https://ietf.org/about/
** ... add other examples you think are inspiring or have good content/design etc.

'''Events'''
* Already covered by a separate session just for this.

'''People'''
* Currently new folks in the community are presented with a bunch of different places to "add themselves" and this can either be tiresome, or a good introduction to various technologies, or maybe some of both? (accidental design). How can we make this deliberate one way or another? E.g. focus on simplicity, usability, or explicit "exercises" to help teach wiki editing or whatever else helps people contribute to the community more effectively. Current places / things for people in rough order that they're asked to create/edit them on [[IRC]]:
*# [[irc-people]]
*# Their User: page
*# sparkline user template (e.g. <nowiki>{{t}}</nowiki> for {{t}})
** others?

'''Projects'''
* [[Projects]] still needs a massive update. How do we make this happen so that it's useful for both newcomers and existing community members of as many [[Generations]] as possible?

'''Getting Started'''
* [[Getting Started]] can be a make or break page for new people discovering the community; how can we make this page as easy / simple / accessible as possible with clear(er) instructions and explanations of the benefits of each thing we recommend people do?

'''Other types of pages?'''
* What other types of pages need help / improvements?

=== More Logos ===
Would it be useful to have new logos for various IndieWeb things, building blocks etc.? (more stickers, etc.)

'''Interested'''
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

E.g. which of these?
* IndieWeb (as distinct from IndieWebCamp)
** Hexagon versions thereof (and consider a hexagon variant for any new logo)
* [[Webmention]]
* [[Micropub]]
* [[microformats2]] (does it need a different logo than [[microformats]]?)
* family of related looking logos for key vocabularies:
** [[h-feed]]
** [[h-entry]]
** [[h-card]]
** [[h-event]]
** ... others?
* [[Vouch]]
* [[Salmentions]]
* [[IndieAuth]] (the protocol)
* [[indieauth.com]] (perhaps renamed)
* ...

=== Community Repos ===
* {{gwg}} would like to discuss how to decide what belongs in the community repositories and how projects here should develop. Currently, these host things like the WordPress Indieweb plugin and various mf2 parsers.

=== Code of Conduct Review ===
While reviewing our code of conduct and others, I realized others have concrete steps and contact info for addressing CoC violations, such as an email address or phone number to report to. e.g. Mozilla's [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/ Community Participation Guidelines] that they asked us to abide by for IndieWeb Summit has a "Reporting" section.

=== prep for keynotes tomorrow ===
{{aaronpk}}: We should spend a little time prepping/rehearsing for keynote demos the next morning, to make sure the demos are snappy and to the point and don't take up a ton of the morning time. Last year I think we were a little too rambly in the morning without making a clear point.

=== future meetings ===
{{aaronpk}}: we should discuss what it might look like to have more regular meetings like this, potentially even completely online, because:
* there is a very long list of sessions here, and it's likely we won't have time to go in depth on everything
* we've been talking about things like the chat channels for months without feeling like we can do anything about it until this meeting
* most of the participants here are remote anyway

=== session name ===
Timebox: MM min. (assume 30min by default)

PROPOSER(S): SUMMARY
* DETAILS

== Discussion ==
When?
* Morning of 2018-06-25, because:
** morning = remote participation with European leaders
*** {{petermolnar}} that would be nice indeed
** the "before lunch" time is particularly effective at having a high-cognitive-functioning focused meetup to decide on "hard questions" of community and such
** break for lunch / random leader bonding activity
** afternoon: optional OSBridge barcamp day
** afternoon: or just enjoy Portland outdoors in the sunshine


'''Options: (please note your opinions/thoughts below!)'''
* 9:00-13:30, get your own breakfast beforehand (ok to bring in)
** ...
* 8:00-12:30, kick it off with a DIY veggie breakfast taco bar
** ...
