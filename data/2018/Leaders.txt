=== GitHub Community Management and Overlap ===
When: 2018-06-25 10:00

'''Proposer:''' {{martijnvdven}}

# There is currently an odd overlap between the GitHub organisations [https://github.com/microformats/ <code>microformats</code>] and [https://github.com/indieweb/ <code>indieweb</code>].
# It is also unclear how people can join the IndieWeb organisation in the first place.

* The PHP parser is a project of the IndieWeb organisation, while the Python one is under the Microformats organisation. Is this just a legacy thing? Where would future projects go?
* Is there a magical point where we will ask projects to move their repository under one of the organisations?
** This goes back to a point {{GWG}} made on “how to decide what belongs” to the community.
* When {{jgarber}} asked [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-06-21#t1529605111729200 how to become a member], nobody could really give a clear answer ([https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-06-21#t1529606076718800 “just judgment”]).
** {{kartikprabhu}} turned out to have [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-06-21#t1529606067299600 owner status] but [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-06-21#t1529606095482500 didn’t know how/when he got it].

==== Leaders Summit Discussion ====
* Someone made the indieweb org a long time ago and invited everyone they could think of as an admin, so lots of those people don't really know they are a member anyway
* Proposal: {{GWG}}: moving parsers into microformats org makes sense
* {{tantek}}: mf2 helpers have been pretty indieweb-specific so maybe they should stay under indieweb org

'''Actions:'''
* Move: https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2 (add gregorlove to microformats gitub community, then he'll move it)
* Move; https://github.com/indieweb/microformats-ruby (contact Jason Garber)
* Document: jf2 spec is on indieweb, so makes sense for the code to live in same org as the spec - so we don't move it.

'''It is also unclear how people can join the IndieWeb organisation in the first place.'''

Can we solidify some sort of guidelines?

* What does it mean to be an owner of the org?
** This should be a small set of people because owners have lots of power over the org configuration.
** {{aaronpk}} suggests: go through existing list of owners and drop them down to member unless they are a "leader"
* What does it mean to be a member?
** anyone who wants to push code to an IndieWeb repo should be allowed to become a member
** we should make it so that any member can write to any repo (e.g. push to master, accept PRs, ...)
*** this may be complicated w/ GitHub's Teams per-repo configuration requirements
* What is the bar for leaving?
** owner-to-member was answered above
** no current pressure to remove members

=== [[CoC]] Review and Designated Contacts for Chat ===
When: 2018-06-25 10:35

'''Proposer:''' {{martijnvdven}}

This session could be combined with a general discussion going through [[Leaders#Code_of_Conduct|previously raised issues]] and [[code-of-conduct-feedback#Open_Discussions|feedback]]. As for the reason of this proposal:

Recently {{martijnvdven}} was contacted by someone who felt another community member in the [[chat]] had gone beyond what would be respectable per the [[Code of Conduct]]. This brought up a number of interesting things:

# They contacted me because they see me around a lot, and had seen I was online at the time of the incident. It is possible they also went and contacted other “leaders”. Without a central contact or a side-channel for leaders to discuss these issues, I have no way of knowing.
# <p>Because of how the IndieWeb chat is used asynchronously a lot of the time, the parties involved were not online at the same time. This means that the “Resolve Peacefully” and “Apologize for Mistakes” sections are a lot harder to effectively apply. This is definitely the CoC falling short (in {{martijnvdven}}’s humble opinion) and its base in [[code-of-conduct-feedback#Event_Specific|physical events]] shows.</p><p>Recently there was a little thing in the chat where someone made their displeasure known about something, and {{tantek}} urged the two parties to talk it out and use the unlogged #indieweb-chat. (Paraphrasing as I can’t find it in the logs right now.) This is the CoC getting applied well, but only worked because at that time the chat was being used synchronously.</p>

'''Interested:'''
* {{martijnvdven}} — I would like to specifically take a moment to discuss what methods we “leaders” (or the appointed CoC contacts for chat) should use to resolve conflicts smoothly and expeditiously. Especially how to do this without blowing every issue into the wide open for everyone to see and comment on.
* {{addyourself}}

'''Designate [[CoC]] Contacts for [[2018|IWS]]'''
'''Proposer:''' {{aaronpk}}

We should offer people a number of possible contact points in case they feel any [[Code of Conduct]] breach has taken place.

'''Interested'''
* {{martymcguire}}
* {{addyourself}}

==== Leaders Summit Discussion ====
===== In-Person Points of Contact for CoC Issues =====

* {{gwg}}: All attendees of Leaders Summit okay with being in-person contacts?
* {{aaronpk}}: we all look alike, so we should have more diverse points of contact. will ask organizer of Women Who Code.
** we should have ~4 points of contact.
*** {{tantek}}, {{aaronpk}}, aaronpk will contact at least one more
*** last year we had one more 

{{aaronpk}} - how this works:
* start of day - all contacts will be identified as contacts
* contacts must be familier with the CoC and related procedures
* contacts should provide phone # (assuming they have one) and email address they will monitor for more private communications
** {{martijnvdven}} volunteered to monitor an email address. also to monitor chat.

* in later discussion it was suggested {{macgenie}} should be an in-person contact for [[2018]].

===== Remote Points of Contact for CoC Issues =====
* contact form that goes to ... ?
** {{martijnvdven}}: offer separate contact info for organizers and contacts, so reporter can choose who to contact.
** {{t}}: sounds like extra IndieWeb Community Infrastructure (separate topic)
** we talked ourselves out of this. better to offer personal points of contact.

For issues in the community virtual spaces (IRC):
* {{aaronpk}}: anyone should feel empowered to discuss issues happening in the community (e.g. someone feels attacked). we want to curb behaviors that lead to someone feeling attacked, and that requires talking to the person who is the source of the behavior.
* {{martijnvdven}}: feels more comfortable starting a conversation about issues if listed as a point of contact.
** {{t}} I've seen such "lists" just devolve into useless threads and bikeshedding. From experience, I think using lists for such "soft" topics is an anti-pattern (makes the problem more likely worse than better) 
*** {{t}}: do you mean email lists??
*** {{aaronpk}}: yes - that was never a proposal :)
*** {{t}}: "on a list" sounds like email list in typical dev/internet-talk
*** {{aaronpk}}: ftfy
* {{aaronpk}} Code of Conduct page should have a "what to do if you experience a CoC violation" which includes a list of people who can be contacted. if you are contacted about a CoC violation - you don't have to be on the list to handle the issue.
* {{gRegor}}: points of contact should make sure their wiki user page links ways to contact them outside of chat.

'''Actions:'''
* leaders willing to be (no, make a precise list here) points of contact should add themselves (including local timezone) to [[code-of-conduct#Resolving_an_Issue]]
** {{martymcguire}}, {{aaronpk}}, {{martijnvdven}}, {{gRegor}}, {{calumryan}}, and {{macgenie}} added



== New ideas ==

==== IndieWeb principles split and reorg ====
'''Proposer:''' {{jgmac1106}}, 2018-04-18 [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=2018/Leaders&diff=prev&oldid=46971]
* in order to have more inclusive, gen2-3-4 friendly indieweb descriptions, the idea to reorganize the principles had come up, starting from most gen4 oriented downwards to gen1 oriented.
** {{tantek}}: Start more modest, just rephrasing to be inclusive of gen2. Then get gen2 folks to help write a gen3 friendly version. It is highly unlikely that gen1 folks will be able to write effectively for gen3+ (too different a perspective).

'''Interested:'''
* {{petermolnar}}
* {{martymcguire}}
* {{addyourself}}

==== Re-evaluate sponsorship policy ====
'''Proposer:''' {{aaronpk}}, 2018-04-19 [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=2018/Leaders&diff=next&oldid=47014]

* Currently we have a bunch of links in the footer from hosts from several years ago. Might want to consider a more formal/strict policy of when those fall off the page and are only shown on the specific event page.

'''Interested:'''
* {{martymcguire}}
* {{addyourself}}

==== non-profit organization ====
'''Proposer:''' {{aaronpk}}

{{aaronpk}}: As the community grows, having a formal organization could benefit us in a few ways. There has been some talk in [[discuss|chat]] of a "bug bounty" program or having a fund to support individual projects. While I don't think IndieWeb itself should become a formal organization, there is definitely an opportunity for other individuals to form adjacent organizations to handle things.
{{ jgmac1106}}: I am applying for federal grants and there wasn't an organization or person I could point to or include. 

examples:
* [https://rubytogether.org/ Ruby Together] "Ruby Together is a grassroots initiative committed to supporting the critical Ruby infrastructure you rely on"
* [https://opencollective.com/ Open Together] "A system for Open Source

==== Establish an IWC/training for University with Domains of Owns One Projects ====
'''Proposer:''' {{jgmac1106}},

* {{jgmac1106}}: There are a number of college administrators who have contacted us about trying to include IndieWeb into their Domain projects. {{gwg}} and {{chrisaldrich}} through around the idea of an IWC for this audience. May just want to think about a: are we ready? b: best approach to help.


==== prep for keynotes tomorrow ====
'''Proposer:''' {{aaronpk}}

{{aaronpk}}: We should spend a little time prepping/rehearsing for keynote demos the next morning, to make sure the demos are snappy and to the point and don't take up a ton of the morning time. Last year I think we were a little too rambly in the morning without making a clear point.

{{gRegor}}: Review [[2018/Introduction]] and make sure it covers everything. See typical IWC introduction list in HTML comments on the page.

'''Interested:'''
* {{martymcguire}}
* {{addyourself}}

==== IndieWeb Community Infrastructure ====
'''Proposer:''' {{martijnvdven}}

Currently the IndieWeb (as an organisation) is using several services, but it is not always clear who to contact about which part. It may be good to compile a list of third-parties that are depended upon, and who the contacts are for those.

Possible discussion points, taken from [[Leaders#Issues|the running issues]]:

* What services are essential for running the IndieWeb community resources, and who has access to them?
** Content
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[wiki]] [https://github.com/indieweb/wiki available on GitHub].
*** There is an entire back-up of the [[discuss|chat]] logs [https://github.com/indieweb/indieweb-chat-archive available on GitHub].
** Domain name(s)
*** Who has access to <code><nowiki>indieweb.org</nowiki></code>, can configure the DNS, etc?
*** How can access to these be split amongst several people?
** Communication
*** Who can manage the [[Slack]] server / channels?
*** Who can manage the [[IRC]] channels?
**** It looks like we have several <code>+o</code> people. Are they all listed as Founders or equal on ChanServ?
***** All 5 [[discuss#Chat_Channels|chat channels]] list {{benthatmustbeme}} and {{aaronpk}} as Founder. (Checkable by writing <code>/msg ChanServ INFO #indieweb</code> in your IRC client.)
**** all ops are in US timezones and thus not available on EU mornings (discussed 2017-12-17 due to small spam-wave on Freenode)
**** Is there anything to gain from [https://freenode.net/groupreg registering with Freenode]? (or has this been done already?)
*** Is there any managing we have to do for the [[Matrix]] bridge?
*** How quickly could a new Slack bridge be created if [[Loqi]] goes down? The bridge code is [https://github.com/aaronpk/Slack-IRC-Gateway available on GitHub].
** Official channels
*** Again, who has access, and what are the backups?
*** There is an official [[Twitter]]: [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp]
*** There is an official [[GitHub]]: [https://github.com/indieweb/ IndieWeb]
** For projects we depend on, e.g. the Slack bridge, should they be mirrored to the indieweb GitHub account? That way the community has them even if the original author decides the remove their repository.
** Third parties we depend on? Can more of these be self-hosted?
*** Currently the wiki login only works through [[IndieAuth.com]].

''' Notes '''
* On 2018-05-01 [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-05-01/1525186645668800 several] [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-05-01/1525190543567300 people] brought up [https://www.voidlinux.eu/news/2018/05/serious-issues.html the issues faced by Void Linux]. Here the “project leader” “disappeared”, leaving things like DNS and GitHub uncontrollable by those still in the community.
* The wiki documents IndieWeb [[expenses]]. [[opencollective|Open Collective]] has a separate track of [https://opencollective.com/indieweb#expenses IndieWeb expenses]. These offer a glimpse of the services IndieWeb is paying for, but may not show the complete picture either.

* Community Repos
** new criteria for moving in (and possibly moving out) repos to (and from) the indieweb org repo on GitHub
** have adaptable thresholds for projects that might need the extra nudge (and that do not allow much plurality anyway) like WP plugins

'''Interested'''
* ... add yourself if you're interested in a session about this

Timebox: MM min. (assume 30min by default)

'''Proposer:''' Summary
* DETAILS

== Task List ==
Note the tasks coming out of sessions.

* Move: https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2 (add {{gRegor}} to microformats gitub community, then he'll move it)
* Move: https://github.com/indieweb/microformats-ruby (contact {{jgarber}})

*...

== Planning ==
When?
* Morning of 2018-06-25, because:
** morning = remote participation with European leaders

** break for lunch / random leader bonding activity
** afternoon: optional OSBridge barcamp day
** afternoon: or just enjoy Portland outdoors in the sunshine


'''Options: (please note your opinions/thoughts below!)'''
* 9:00-13:30, get your own breakfast beforehand (ok to bring in)
** ...
* 8:00-12:30, kick it off with a DIY veggie breakfast taco bar
