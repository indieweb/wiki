The '''fourth IndieWebCamp in Berlin''', but just one of many [[IndieWebCamps]]!

<div class="e-content">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. To grow it and help people gettings started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Berlin for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, teaching, helping.

Join us right before the [https://accessibility-club.org Accessibility Club Conference 2018] and [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2018 beyond tellerrand // BERLIN 2018] and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe more importantly – encourage users to own their own content and identities.
