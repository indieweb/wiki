= <span class="p-name">IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2018</span> =

The '''fourth IndieWebCamp in Düsseldorf''', but just one of many [[IndieWebCamps]]!

<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness every year. But there is still a lot of work to do to help people to understand what the IndieWeb is and “owning your data” actually means at all. To achieve this, to grow it and to help people getting started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Düsseldorf for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, collaborating, teaching, helping and much more.

Join us during [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2018 beyond tellerrand in Düsseldorf] and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe most importantly – encourage everybody to own their own content and identities.

Food and drinks during the whole IndieWebCamp available and sponsored by sipgate.
