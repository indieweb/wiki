IndieWebCamp DÃ¼sseldorf 2018
Session: Private Posts / Permission layer for webmentions

== Participants ==
* River https://river.cat
* Sebastiaan https://seblog.nl
* Matthias https://matthiasott.com

== Notes ==
* Authorisation for feeds?
* Notifications that private posts exist that you can see, otherwise don't bother logging in.
* How do I notify mentioned people? (private webmention)
* How to respond to unathorised request, to not give away information with a 401, 403.
* Maybe private webmentions should try to auth without asking first, in case the site does not admit the page exists.
