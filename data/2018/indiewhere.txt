* dietrich
* Mathew Lippencot

== Notes ==

* Location and sharing, privacy (forrest)
* Fragility of web infra (gozala)
* decentraliztion
* Place is fundamental to being a human.
* Chain of custody/ identity / verification/ geo display


* map.io
* xcites citizen science pigmy tribes
*digital democracy / mapeo (amazon mapping)


* holochain

Notes from Dietrich:
* Forrest Hawes
* forest.stream
* GIS
* Chris Hawes, Qorvo
* Geospatial intelligence
* Location sharing is contextual
* Irakli
* Mozilla
* web infra is fragile
* how to solve bottlenecks
* internet providers play big role
* disaster response
* edrex
* bad sysadmin
* edrex.pdxhub.org
* resilience
* indie web is now, but dweb and fabric are 5yrs out
* jim pick
* gis is fundamental
* mobile changed that but Google controls
* mathew Lippincott
* env modeling
* industrial design
* types of monitoring
* requests for geospatial display
* big issues are privacy, chain of custody
* verification
* nearing announce of balloon system
* mapeo by digital democracy
* excites, university London
* Basque sheepherders
* contribute to geological survey
* over reliance on physical infra
* earthquake prep
* Cascadia rising
* what do we do?
* hyper capitalism is destructive to infrastructure
* cooperatives
* cascadia computing & communications cooperative
* pnw mesh
* tech on West of Cascades
* data centers in East of Cascades
* Bitcoin communes of the Columbia valley
* what happens when the earthquake hits and the military takes control
* diy sdr stacks
* 6-7 county area
* 3200 servers, forklift batteries
* coop to run
* firmware updates across lots of devices
* county-run compute nodes
* Run ipfs on these...
* Initial internet: survive nuclear holocaust
* not surviving corporate attacks
* how to put gis data in public control
* donp
* privacy in location?
* self host location data
* Aaron had a project
* ice condor
* but all centralized
* fishing location for tribes
* chain of custody
* "I'm a professional scientist"
* Scientists and labs just sign stuff makes it true
* but citizen science, noooooo
* software can help by using location and timecode and photo to use for chain of custody
* trust the person taking the photo to some degree
* keys for better trust models?
* What do we replicate?
* In the nw, building a new internet
* don't the nodes decide... with the power plug?
* Basques have experience in this area
* need moderation, has to come from somewhere
* where to host geospatial data?
* running server is good, but not everyone can do
* can browsers help... Even with geoip
* geoip is or isn't useful?
* used to be based on urls, but not as meaningful when no urls and domains?
* dat, other distributed protocols all around this
* what if we had a web that paid by providing services instead of ad model
* but s7 networks (mobile telco nodes) aren't private
* where do we keep our where data?
* multiple layers
* missing good strategies for security and privacy - sending locations out in clear text
* how do you trust computation
* holochain
* blockchain without pow and achieve consensus
* No way to cheat because everyone runs the same code
* like ethereum in that code sandbox
* holo has no single blockchain
* ux?
* Atlas - microformat for location, proposal
* Military uses rdf
