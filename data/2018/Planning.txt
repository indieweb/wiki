<span class="p-summary">Welcome to the planning page for <dfn>IndieWeb Summit [[2018]]</dfn>.</span>

We will be running IndieWeb Summit during the week of Open Source Bridge this year. 

OSBridge is changing their format for their 10th year, and instead of a full week of talks, they are hosting only one day of unconference sessions on Friday.

== Dates ==
* IndieWeb Summit: June 26-27th
* OSBridge Unconference: June 29th
* ([[Leaders]] Summit June 25th, see '''[[Leaders]]''' if you want to participate!)

== Venue ==
* Venue: Eliot Center
** We will have the large room on the first floor the whole two days, as well as 2 classrooms on the first floor.
** The large space can be subdivided with a wall to turn it into two spaces for sessions.
** '''Awaiting confirmation on rooms'''

Venue ideas?
* Can Mozilla host the [[Leaders]] summit?
** pretty sure I can find space for [[Leaders]] summit the day before - {{t}}

=== On-site Considerations ===
* food - vegetarian default
** we can order food in for day 2 if we want
* on-site childcare (was asked about the week before [[2016]], so we should look into options, costs, possible sponsorship thereof etc.) note: we did not put this together in time for 2017 so will have to try again for 2018.
** Can or is Open Source Bridge / Eliot Center providing on-site childcare?
* coffee is provided by eliot center at the cost of $1/person/refill

== Tickets and Registration ==
* Ticketing:
** No joint registration with osbridge
** Our tickets are available at https://2018.indieweb.org

== Leaders Summit ==
{{main|2018/Leaders}}

Similar to [[2016/Leaders]] & [[2017/Leaders]], the [[2018/Leaders|Leaders]] Summit sessions are open to everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] from 2015-2017 or at least two [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups during those years, and posted at least one meetup photo. If you're not sure, ask an [[2017#Organizers|organizer]].

== Notes from previous years ==
Notes from after 2017 IndieWeb Summit to keep in mind for this year

* In 2017 we had 50 registrations, and ordered food for 40.
* 31 people attended on day 1, and 21 attended on day 2.
* Hot breakfast on day 1 was great, and many people ate the leftovers for lunch that day. We still had too much left over though.
* We consistently have people drop out the second day, so we can likely order less food for the second day than the first.
* We had way too many bagels for day 2 breakfast. We can probably order 1 bagel for every 2 people.
* The afternoon coffee refresh was a good idea, but it should have come around 2pm instead of 3pm. Also we didn't need as much as was ordered. The 4 coffees in the morning was a good amount, and probably needed only 2 more in the afternoon.
* An external sign out on the street would have made it easier to find.
* Several remote attendees filled out the ti.to registration, so we should make sure it's clear that the ti.to registration is just for in-person attendance.
* Some people registered on ti.to twice, a month apart. Not sure what the problem there was or how to fix it.
* We lost the beginning of the demos because Wirecast on the computer that was recording/streaming to youtube crashed. In the future, we should record the Vidyo stream in the main room as well as a backup.
** Wait I thought we did, didn't we? - {{t}}
** ''as well as a backup'' <- we did not have our own backup recording {{aaronpk}}
* We forgot to take a group photo on day 2.
* Designate a camera-free area (like a conference room without a Vidyo setup) for people to use to type in passwords when they want to make sure they aren't being livestreamed and filmed at multiple angles
