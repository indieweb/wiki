We will be running IndieWeb Summit during the week of Open Source Bridge this year. 

OSBridge is changing their format for their 10th year, and instead of a full week of talks, they are hosting only one day of unconference sessions on Friday.

== Dates ==
* IndieWeb Summit: June 26-27th
* OSBridge Unconference: June 29th
* ([[Organizers]] Summit June 25th, see '''[[Organizers]]''' if you want to participate!)

== Venue ==
* Venue: Eliot Center
** We will have the large room on the first floor the whole two days
** The large room is split into 3 sections
** Includes lobby for registration/food, and courtyard access

Venue ideas?
* Can Mozilla host the [[Organizers]] summit?
** pretty sure I can find space for [[Organizers]] summit the day before - {{t}}
** this has been confirmed

"a couple good quotes about the summit and Indie Web for a blog entry? What the Indie Web is about and what will happen at the summit"

* "The 8th annual IndieWeb Summit brings together innovators, artists, designers, developers, and journalists who are passionate about sharing, making, and growing the independent web, publishing & interacting directly with each other using personal websites instead of social media silos." - {{t}} - feel free to also quote from and cite http://tantek.com/2018/171/t1/share-make-grow-independent-web <blockquote>The 8th @IndieWebSummit gathers innovators, artists, designers, and journalists to share, make, and grow the independent web, publishing & interacting with each other using their personal websites instead of social media silos. https://twitter.com/t/status/1009485217432784896</blockquote>
* "We want to make it easier for everyone to have a personal site and own their data, without requiring them to be a developer." or any other snippet that may be appropriate from https://gregorlove.com/2017/06/indieweb-appreciation/
** To avoid being pre-emptively defensive, can strike "without requiring them to be a developer" from the quote
* On June 26th technologists, innovators, journalists, artists, designers, educators, and developers will gather for the 8th Annual IndieWeb Summit to help build a better web where everyone owns their data, publishes from their own websites, and share across networks free of corporate interest.
* The 8th annual IndieWeb Summit brings together innovators, artists, designers, developers, and journalists who are passionate about sharing, making, and growing the independent web. The conference focuses on building and sharing tools to empower everyone to own their data and publish from a personal website.

{{main|2018/Organizers}}

Similar to [[2016/Organizers]] & [[2017/Organizers]], the [[2018/Organizers|Organizers]] Summit sessions are open to everyone who has co-organized an [[IndieWebCamp]] from 2015-2017 or at least two [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups during those years, and posted at least one meetup photo. If you're not sure, ask an [[2017#Organizers|organizer]].

== Notes from previous years ==
Notes from after 2017 IndieWeb Summit to keep in mind for this year

* In 2017 we had 50 registrations, and ordered food for 40.
* 31 people attended on day 1, and 21 attended on day 2.
* Hot breakfast on day 1 was great, and many people ate the leftovers for lunch that day. We still had too much left over though.
* We consistently have people drop out the second day, so we can likely order less food for the second day than the first.
* We had way too many bagels for day 2 breakfast. We can probably order 1 bagel for every 2 people.
* The afternoon coffee refresh was a good idea, but it should have come around 2pm instead of 3pm. Also we didn't need as much as was ordered. The 4 coffees in the morning was a good amount, and probably needed only 2 more in the afternoon.
* An external sign out on the street would have made it easier to find.
* Several remote attendees filled out the ti.to registration, so we should make sure it's clear that the ti.to registration is just for in-person attendance.
* Some people registered on ti.to twice, a month apart. Not sure what the problem there was or how to fix it.
* We lost the beginning of the demos because Wirecast on the computer that was recording/streaming to youtube crashed. In the future, we should record the Vidyo stream in the main room as well as a backup.
** Wait I thought we did, didn't we? - {{t}}
** ''as well as a backup'' <- we did not have our own backup recording {{aaronpk}}
* We forgot to take a group photo on day 2.
* Designate a camera-free area (like a conference room without a Vidyo setup) for people to use to type in passwords when they want to make sure they aren't being livestreamed and filmed at multiple angles

=== On-site Considerations ===
* food - vegetarian default
** we can order food in for day 2 if we want
* on-site childcare (was asked about the week before [[2016]], so we should look into options, costs, possible sponsorship thereof etc.) note: we did not put this together in time for 2017 so will have to try again for 2018.
** Can or is Open Source Bridge / Eliot Center providing on-site childcare?
* coffee is provided by eliot center at the cost of $1/person/refill
