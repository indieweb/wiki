<span class="p-summary">Welcome to the planning page for <dfn>IndieWeb Summit [[2018]]</dfn>.</span>

It looks like we will be running IndieWeb Summit as part of Open Source Bridge this year. 
* '''Awaiting confirmation!'''

OSBridge is changing their format for their 10th year, and instead of a full week of talks, the first two days they're hosting other community events. This will have some implications on our event, but everything seems doable.

* Venue: Eliot Center
** I asked for a large space at the beginning of day 1 and end of day 2 for our keynotes and demos
** We'll have 3 breakout rooms the rest of the time
** '''Awaiting confirmation!'''
* Dates: 
** IndieWeb Summit: June 26-27th  ([[Leaders]] Summit June 25th, see '''[[Leaders]]''' if you want to participate!)
** OSBridge Talks: June 28-29th
* Food: 
** osbridge is not bringing in full meals, but they will be providing snacks and beverages throughout the event
** we can order food in for day 2 if we want
* Ticketing:
** People who register for osbridge will be able to select IndieWeb Summit as a community event option
** We can set the price for our tickets if someone wants to register for only IndieWeb Summit
** We can still have the free indie rsvp option by somehow providing a coupon code after you send an RSVP webmention
** '''Awaiting confirmation!'''

We may try to organize a large closing session Wednesday night across all the community events. In that case, we could have our demos take place along with everyone else, which could be fun to present to a larger audience in a proper event space.

Anyone coming for IndieWeb Summit is encouraged to submit a talk proposal to [[OSBridge]] as well.
* Start writing your talk proposal - OSBridge 2018 CFP has yet to go out.

== Venue ==
* TBD

Venue ideas?
* '''Eliot Center''' - if run in conjunction with Open Source Bridge
* Alchemy Code Lab - they host [[Donut.js]] and other meetups
* Mozilla - can they host again this year?
** possibly - will look into it. - {{t}}
** pretty sure I can find space for [[Leaders]] summit the day before - {{t}}

=== On-site Considerations ===
* food - vegetarian default
* on-site childcare (was asked about the week before [[2016]], so we should look into options, costs, possible sponsorship thereof etc.) note: we did not put this together in time for 2017 so will have to try again for 2018.
** Can or is Open Source Bridge / Eliot Center providing on-site childcare?

== Notes from previous years ==
Notes from after 2017 IndieWeb Summit to keep in mind for this year

* In 2017 we had 50 registrations, and ordered food for 40.
* 31 people attended on day 1, and 21 attended on day 2.
* Hot breakfast on day 1 was great, and many people ate the leftovers for lunch that day. We still had too much left over though.
* We consistently have people drop out the second day, so we can likely order less food for the second day than the first.
* We had way too many bagels for day 2 breakfast. We can probably order 1 bagel for every 2 people.
* The afternoon coffee refresh was a good idea, but it should have come around 2pm instead of 3pm. Also we didn't need as much as was ordered. The 4 coffees in the morning was a good amount, and probably needed only 2 more in the afternoon.
* An external sign out on the street would have made it easier to find.
* Several remote attendees filled out the ti.to registration, so we should make sure it's clear that the ti.to registration is just for in-person attendance.
* Some people registered on ti.to twice, a month apart. Not sure what the problem there was or how to fix it.
* We lost the beginning of the demos because Wirecast on the computer that was recording/streaming to youtube crashed. In the future, we should record the Vidyo stream in the main room as well as a backup.
** Wait I thought we did, didn't we? - {{t}}
** ''as well as a backup'' <- we did not have our own backup recording {{aaronpk}}
* We forgot to take a group photo on day 2.
* Designate a camera-free area (like a conference room without a Vidyo setup) for people to use to type in passwords when they want to make sure they aren't being livestreamed and filmed at multiple angles
