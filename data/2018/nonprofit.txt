== Notes ==
* {{jmac}} of the [http://iftechfoundation.org/ Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation]
* {{jmac}} a nonprofit opens a door
* Dori Smith I have helped a lot of 5013c and I am interested into organization
* {{jmac}} longevity is a goal of mine
* {{j12t}} We need more entreprenuerial out of the box solutions.
* {{jgmac1106}} board member of a few 501c3s, currently writing grants but has to contract with specific developers but would be easier to contract with an indieweb nonprofit. Worried about contributing to an organization with a board.
* Forrest:  Social corporation techpraxis.io (currently a placeholder site) was founded to help each other. We build co-operatives and worker communities. I don't like nonprofits. I am done with them. We are working to build a multi-stakeholder cooperative.
* Fiona: I'm participating remotely so forgive me if I'm not doing this right :) but maybe look at RubyTogether for inspiration? https://rubytogether.org/ Yes! let us know if you want to virtually raise your hand.
* {{aaronpk}} Each event is run individually and the organizers are repsponsible for funding. I have been doing it through it personal LLCs, in Berlin it is through a company. I do a personal LLC as I want to avoid overhead. nonprofits, C-Corp is bigger, taxes get more complicated, would need insurance. I fear the longevity. 
* {{jgmac1106}} The funding model used in tech will not work for #IndieWeb  we should maybe consider co-op
* {{j12t}} Problems to solve
** events+
** tech development++
** vendor/customer collaborative/governance++
** larger grants/projects

== Ideas ==
* {{aaronpk}} I would prefer a seperate entity to join in supporting like {{fiona}} brought up as https://rubytogether.org
* {{j12t}} and Forrest push for a cooperative
* {{j12t}} suggests a nonprofit, an individual LLC, and private individuals can all be members of the co-op. Might be a need for 1+1+1 but not a thousand member solution
* {{jmac}} says we need a 

== Next Steps ==
* {{aaronpk}} Figure out what benefits from money and figure out process to determine how to fund those; some people in the community could build things faster if they had direct support
* {{jmac}}: Create a one page document explaining our missions and goals

== Call to Action  ==
* If you would like get more involved in determining the governance model please add your name here:
** {{addyourself}}
