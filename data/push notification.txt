A '''<dfn>push notification</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>client notification</dfn>) is a [[notification]] that shows up on one or more of your client devices without you having to explicitly request it â€” it's "pushed" to you, instead of you having to poll for it.

=== Why ===
You should implement push notifications for yourself, your site so you don't have to poll your [[notifications]] page.

=== How to ===
No replicable indieweb solutions to Push Notifications yet. See [[#Projects]] below for work in progress and [[#Brainstorming]] for areas to explore.

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}}'s site aaronparecki.com receives [[webmentions]] and then sends them to his own IRC channel, which then sends a push notification to his phone when his IRC status is "AFK" status. The notification sends just the two URLs (source, target), and the type of webmention, e.g. [[reply]], [[like]], etc. [[mention-app]] (see Projects below) is his eventual goal.

==== Ben Roberts ====
{{benthatmustbeme}}'s site uses Google Cloud Messaging service to send notifications to his phone and desktop.  This uses the new Push API still being implemented in browsers.  The notification simply links to ben.thatmustbe.me/activity but more recent versions would allow for pushing information to the notifier as well.  While mobile works, it seems to forget itself after a time (restart of phone?).

=== Projects ===
==== Mention app ====
{{main|mention-app}}
* Aaronpk is working on an iOS app (for now called just [[mention-app]]) to send him push notifications from an [[h-feed]]. Thus, if a server publishes received [[webmentions]] into an h-feed page, the app will get those (hopefully via [[PuSH]], last resort via polling), and propagate them to the user's iOS device.

=== Brainstorming ===
For notifications from an indieweb site to a web browser on a device, you may be able to use one or more of the following:
* http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/
* https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush
** Works on FirefoxOS devices and (presumably) the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client desktop simulator]
* [[Pushover]]
* [[Pushbullet]]
* https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notificatons-on-the-open-web?hl=en
** This describes how to do it specifically in Chrome
** Supported in Firefox as well [https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/01/25/firefox-can-now-get-push-notifications-from-your-favorite-sites/ since 2016-01]
* if you use a mobile messenger with push support, messages sent by a bot work like a kind of push message
