'''<dfn>SNSRouter</dfn>''' is a web UI [[project]] built upon [[SNSAPI]] where one can read an aggregated timeline from different sites, mass forward messages, and update statuses on all channels.

* GitHub: https://github.com/hupili/sns-router
* Maintainer: [[User:Hupili.net]]

== Advantages ==
* All advantages are inherited from [[SNSAPI]], i.e. '''scripting ability'''. e.g. [[User:Hupili.net]] uses a 10 line hook to aggregate his messages (status update and forward) to a single RSS. Glance the code [https://github.com/hupili/sns-router/tree/9911b072c8659f1bc45361dfc7459cfbc25740cf/hooks.py#L29]
* Messages are stored in a SQLite DB in canonical format. It's very easy to perform mining tasks with your data. e.g. what are the messages your tagged as "interesting"? what's the time distribution of your incoming messages? which channel gives you the most valuable information?

== Disadvantages ==
* The UI is very poor... I can just make it work but I'm not good at design. Looking forward to cooperating with a designer.
