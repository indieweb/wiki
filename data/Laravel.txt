<dfn>'''[http://laravel.com/ Laravel]'''</dfn> is a [[PHP]] framework.

== IndieWeb packages ==

* [https://github.com/Inklings-io/laravel-indieauth-client Inklings-io/laravel-indieauth-client], a package to add IndieAuth as a client
* [https://github.com/Inklings-io/laravel-indieauth-tokens Inklings-io/laravel-indieauth-tokens], a token endpoint

See also the [[PHP#Libraries|PHP Libraries]], most of which will work in Laravel too.

=== Planned packages ===
* 2015-10-07 [https://davidpeach.co.uk David Peach] has begun planning out a package for easy IndieWeb adoption with Laravel 5.1. Will work as a package includeable through composer.
** 2017-02-21 I have since moved back to WordPress after having lost my server. May attempt at a rebuild at some point soon.
