'''<dfn>Light-Weight Identity</dfn>''' (abbreviated <dfn>LID</dfn>) is a decentralized, user-controlled digital [[identity]] protocol developed in 2004/2005 by [[User:Upon2020.com|Johannes Ernst]] and Tammy Ernst.

It starts with the assumption that individuals claim a place on the web, identified by a URL, and use this URL to identify themselves to others on the web. In the original form, it used gpg for encryption and digital signatures, XML/XPath for profile information, and also supports the sending of encrypted messages from URL to URL.

It was the original URL-based identity protocol, followed by [[OpenID]] (before the latter moved away from URLs as identifiers)
