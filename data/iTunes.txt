'''<dfn>[https://apple.com/itunes iTunes]</dfn>''' is a service and application from [[Apple]] for music, video, podcasts, and other multimedia.

== Exporting Your Data ==

'''In iTunes 11, this option is located under File > Library.''' 
The best way is to ignore the 'Export Library' option and select 'Export Playlist.' The playlist is determined by which playlist you select in the sidebar. This includes 'Music', which represents your library, so you can export your entire library from there. The reason the 'Export Playlist' option is preferred is because you have the option to export as XML or tab delimited CSV (represented as Text or Unicode Text), whereas 'Export Library' only offers XML.

If you want a more meaningful dataset and not literally every piece of information stored in iTunes, you can select all the items in your Library (Cmd +A) and then File > New > Playlist From Selection. Select that playlist and View > Show View Options (or Cmd + J) and select or deselect the columns you want represented in your dataset. Then export that playlist. 

I prefer to export as CSV because I find it more manipulable. You can import it into Excel or OpenOffice and export it as another format. You can also import it as CSV into [http://menial.co.uk/base/ Base] and use it in a sqlite3 database, or export it from there as JSON, MySQL, or back to XML.

And then you can build cool tools to manage this information outside of iTunes, or even visualizations with it.

== Examples ==
[http://herecomesthesummer.com Sound of Summer]
13+ years of iTunes metadata exported in this fashion and turned into a visualization about summer listening habits.
