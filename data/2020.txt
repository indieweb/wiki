'''<dfn class="p-name">IndieWeb Summit 2020</dfn>''' was scheduled to be the 10th annual IndieWeb Summit, 2020-06-27…28, in [[Portland]], but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and replaced with a 100% online [[2020/West|IndieWebCamp West]].

In lieu of the Summit's original dates, we're hosting a  online only camp for the same days and whose details can be found at [[2020/West]].
