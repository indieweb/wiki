{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>throwback</dfn>''' is a current [[post]] of content from some time ago, typically at least days, often years.

There are two potential reasons for posting old content. One would be for the purpose of archiving older content in a newer form, the other would be to share that older content with others.

== Brainstorming == 

{{gwg}} asked the question of whether or not a post should be created past-dated to the original content, and a separate post be created highlighting this currently. This would be consistent with content that was already on your site, that you would highlight in the present, and might be a way to encourage further create of pre-web content.

The use case for {{gwg}} is pre-web content. The example was 1980s era pictures.
