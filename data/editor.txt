An '''<dfn>editor</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb most often refers to a user interface for editing (making changes to) a [[post]], whether an existing post, or when [[creating]] a new post. The term <dfn>editor</dfn> may also refer to a person who edits a post after an author has written it, or even more rarely, the editor of a specification, like [[micropub]], who is the primary contributor and/or verifier of contributions.

== Approaches ==
There are a spectrum of different approaches / opinions / desires for different post creating / editing interfaces / preferences / formats.

From most directly visual, to least visual and code-like, to some code, to all code:
* '''[[WYSIWYG]]''' (e.g. [[MediaWiki]], [[Wordpress]], [[Known]])
* '''"minimal" WYSIWYG''' (e.g. [[Etherpad]], [[Medium]])
* '''plain text only''' (e.g. some comment forms?)
* '''plain text [[auto-link]]ed''' (e.g. [[Falcon]] [[notes]], [[Bundle]] [[notes]], ...)
* '''[[markdown]]''' (e.g. [[Ello]], [[Ghost]]...)
* '''HTML''' (e.g. [[Falcon]] [[articles]], [[Bundle]] [[articles]], ...)
