'''<dfn>[https://glitch.com/ Glitch]</dfn>''' (formerly <dfn>Gomix</dfn>, <dfn>HyperDev</dfn> before that) is a tool by Fog Creek Software to allow you to quickly prototype [[web application]]s in a complete IDE with built in version control, sharing, and more.

It works similar to a CodePen or Gist but it allows you to write a [[Node.js]]-based server to complement the front end.
