A '''<dfn>card</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb are small information summariesâ€”often summaries of specific, external web pages.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
For the moment, current indieweb work is focusing on developing a simpler alternative to all the silo-specific card approaches. See:
* '''[[indiecard]]'''

=== Apple Passbook ===
[[Apple]]
* (Apple Passbook API/format reference needed)

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] uses [[OGP]] and other markup on a page to parse data to shows summaries of pages linked to in Facebook posts in a "card" like presentation.

Examples of Facebook "cards" displays:
* [[link-preview]] for the first URL in a post
* [[hovercard]] shown when hovering the mouse pointer over someone's name, including face, name, friendship status, etc.
* ...

=== Google now ===
{{main|Google now}}

Google now uses cards as a method of display of various information - see the [[Google now]] page for more overall, and http://www.google.com/landing/now/#cards for examples. Some of Google now's cards appear to be produced from [[recommendation engine]]s.

=== Twitter Cards ===
{{main|Twitter Cards}}
[[Twitter]] uses [[OGP]] and their own proprietary meta tags to provide [[Twitter Cards]] functionality in tweets.

== Proxies ==
=== Embedly ===
Embedly has a card embedding service at http://embed.ly/cards that parses other sites, and generates a card that you can embed, using a variant of [[oEmbed]].
