'''<dfn>Monocle</dfn>''' is an open source IndieWeb-enabled [[reader]] developed by {{aaronpk}}.

On April 26, 2016, Monocle was [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/26/3/monocle/ taken offline] potentially to come back in a different incarnation in the future.

== Brainstorming ==
* Main UI paradigm is channels like an IRC client
* Sidebar of channel list (hidden on small screens, slides out from the left)
** see glowing-bear.org for an example
* Each channel stores its logs as files on disk, using QuartzDB
** this means once a post is written to a channel it won't move, like an IRC log
* Core Monocle API only supports writing to channels, reading, and streaming. No feed parsing logic is in the core 
* all content is sent to the channels as Micropub posts, which can include author information to make the post in the channel appear to be written by anyone
* feed parsers and other sources are written as external services
