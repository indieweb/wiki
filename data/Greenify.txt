== Tips ==
* If rooted you get more control
* sometimes the accessibility service turn itself off (when you open the app it should tell you)
make sure to buy the pro version & to install xPosed to benefit from the advanced features otherwise you're really not using the app to its full potential - it probably means you need to flash a custom rom
