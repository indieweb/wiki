'''<dfn>[http://xanga.com Xanga]</dfn>''' is a paid blog hosting service.

== History ==
Originally Xanga was a free blog service. In 2013 they ran a fundraising campaign to make major changes to the platform, changing the backend to [[WordPress]] ("Xanga 2.0"). They announced that after the change to the platform, they would switch to a paid model. [http://thexangateam.xanga.com/2013/05/30/relaunching-xanga-a-fundraiser/] They also announced that users could export their current posts.
