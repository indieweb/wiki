'''<dfn>real-time comments</dfn>''' are the display of [[comments]] on a view of a [[post]] (typically on its permalink) as they are received by the post (presumably via [[webmention]]), without needing any explicit user reloading, refreshing, or any other tapping/clicking etc.

Real-time comments are one of several [[real-time interactions]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com post permalinks to show real-time comments [http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2013/10/13/1/realtime-indieweb-comments since 2013-10-13].

=== Pelle Wessman ===
[[User:Kodfabrik.se|Pelle Wessman]] uses [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ A WebMention Endpoint] on [http://voxpelli.com/ VoxPelli.com] post permalinks to show real-time comments [https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions/releases/tag/v0.4.0 since 2014-12-07].

== Silo Examples ==
Real-time comments are a [[silo]] innovation.
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] was perhaps the first silo to implement real-time comments since 2012(?) at least, on both post permalinks, and sometimes on posts in a stream or in a collection. 
=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]], as of their mid-2014 front-end redesign, now supports (sometimes) showing real-time comments on tweet permalinks:
