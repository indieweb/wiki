[http://github.com/fiatjaf/scrapbook scrapbook] is a [[CouchApp]] that replicates the functionality of the late [[Orkut#Scrapbook]], allowing people to post and receive scraps in a decentralized way, with each person being responsible for hosting their own scrapbook instance.

'''scrapbook''' can be easily hosted in a [[CouchDB]] instance and accessed there directly (as in [[User:fiatjaf.alhur.es|fiatjaf]]'s [http://fiatjaf.scrapbook.smileupps.com/scraps?include_docs=true&descending=true&limit=25 scrapbook]), or it can be embedded as an iframe into a personal webpage (as in [[User:fiatjaf.alhur.es|fiatjaf]]'s [http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/scrapbook web page]).

Although '''scrapbook''' works better if the person sending the scrap also has one '''scrapbook''' of their own (so them can claim the authenticity of their scraps), '''scrapbook''' is not an island, it works with anonymous scraps, named or unnamed, and will surely work with [[webmentions]] if the senders decide to allow CORS on their websites.

== Spam ==

As spam in the Scrapbooks was the main cause of degradation of [[Orkut#See_Also]], scrapbook takes some measures to counteract it:

* It is a indie thing, so it will not be easy for a spammer to find available scrapbooks and spam them as it was with Orkut, a silo in which every click or randomly typed address would take you to a new personal profile;
* It limits the number of scraps allowed to 1 every 100 seconds;
* It requires a [[hashcash]] token to be submitted with every scrap sent;
* It requires the person sending the scrap to go through a cumbersome process that first fetches a token data (changed every 100 seconds) with which to calculate the hashcash token, and only then to submit the token, so it mitigates automated spammers.

Moreover, I don't have any experience or knowledge about spamming, so this is mostly a guess and I'm open to suggestions. You can drop me a line at [http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/scrapbook].--[[User:Fiatjaf.alhur.es|fiatjaf]] 18:16, 27 October 2014 (PDT)
