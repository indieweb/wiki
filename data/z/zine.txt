== Articles about zines in relation to the web ==

* 2014-09-24 [http://anomalily.net/the-indie-web-is-the-new-zines/ The Indie Web Is The New Zines] by Lillian Karabaic.
** "The method of production may be completely different (photocopiers and direct mail vs web posts and servers) but the goals are almost identical – controlling the way in which your message and identity are displayed, crafted, and stored while avoiding censorship that corporate media might impose."
* 2017-02-28 [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/magazine/why-the-internet-didnt-kill-zines.html Why the Internet Didn't Kill Zines] by Jenna Wortham in NYT Magazine 
** "[Shakar Mujukian] described zines as the precursor to personal blogs, but personal blogs have been on the decline over the last decade.

** The "web" of this article might be more the siloed web than the Indie Web.

== Digital Zines ==

Some projects publish zines in a digital format. The classification as zine then comes from the often collaborative creation process and following the cut and paste designs of many paper zines.
