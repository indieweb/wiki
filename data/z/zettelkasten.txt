A '''<dfn>zettelkasten</dfn>''' is note taking system featuring atomic notes which are densely interlinked and are used primarily for writing and acting as an external memory. While most often private repositories, some can be maintained in public as a supplement to or part of a personal website. The word is from German and translates literally as "slip box" (plural '''ZettelkÃ¤sten'''). 

They often will have taxonomies including [[tags]], usually expressing membership in a group, and [[categories]] which more often act as subject headings which might be found on an [[index]] page. Portions of the system also include [[citations]] and references for use in attributing one's ideas to original sources.

While online zettelkasten may have many user interface features in common with their intellectual history antecedent the [[commonplace book]] or related forms like [[wiki]]s and [[digital garden]]s their form and function is subtly different. 

In practice, there are very few websites that one might call "traditional" or stand alone digital ZettelkÃ¤sten in the wild, but people may have their zettelkasten integrated into their website in a hybrid fashion with other functionalities and forms including [[wikis]] and [[blog]]s.


== IndieWeb Examples ==
The examples below are closer to traditional zettelkasten functionality only. Those with hybrid examples are encouraged to place them on the [[commonplace book]], [[wiki]], or other appropriate pages and annotate them as such. This may help those designing specific types of functionality and use cases be more focused on real world examples of actual use.

=== Andy Matuschak ===
[https://andymatuschak.org/ Andy Matuschak] has a digital zettelkasten at https://notes.andymatuschak.org which features a user interface similar to that of [[FedWiki]]. 
* Note that his zettelkasten site is physically separate from his main personal site. 
* Rather than using the German word zettelkasten to describe the form or function of the site, Andy uses the more English-centric terms "notes" or "evergreen notes".

=== Soren Bjornstad ===
[https://sorenbjornstad.com/ Soren Bjornstad], an engineer for [https://www.remnote.io/homepage RemNote] in 2021, has a digital zettelkasten online at https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/. It's built using a customized version of [[TiddlyWiki]]. He's created a video walk through of how his system works which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjpjE5pMZMI.

* 2014 - ongoing https://zettelkasten.de/ is a website focusing on the concept and use of zettelkasten (both digital and analog). While most of the focus of the site is on using digital tools to maintain private, personal zettelkasten, one may be able to extract some hints and use cases for building and maintaining a public digital zettelkasten on a personal website.

== Historical Examples ==
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Paul Jean Paul] (1763-1825), a German romantic novelist, kept an early version of a Zettelkasten made of slips of paper in bound books.
<blockquote>"In the event of a fire, the black-bound excerpts are to be saved first."<br>&mdash;instructions from Jean Paul to his wife before setting off on a trip in 1812 [https://www.dla-marbach.de/presse/presse-details/news/pm-11-2013/]</blockquote>

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann Niklas Luhmann] (1927-1998), a German sociologist and philosopher, was famous for his use of the Zettelkasten (or "slip box") note-taking method. He created a zettelkasten of 90,000+ index cards, and credited it with making his prolific writing possible. His collection was digitized and made available online in 2019.

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Ross_Ashby W. Ross Ashby] (1903-1972) started a commonplace book/zettelkasten in a journal in May 1928 as a medical student. He kept it for 44 years until his death at which point it occupied 25 volumes comprising 7,189 pages and was indexed with 1,600 index cards. The British Library created a digital archive of his system which has been published online with extensive cross linking based on his original index. http://www.rossashby.info/index.html. While somewhat more commonplace in form, Ashby's system also functioned as a zettelkasten in practice.
