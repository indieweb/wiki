'''<dfn>zombie</dfn>''' is in the context of the web a website that had died ([[site-deaths]]), perhaps due to [[lost sites|domain registration neglect]], and has been brought back by some other looking sorta like it did before, but oddly broken, often with spam pages/links added, and eats a lot of CPU likely due to abusive scripts.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Unfortunate examples of past IndieWeb sites that died and had their domains repurposed by others:
* [[User:kylewm.com|kylewm.com]] ‚Äî note: "powered by WordPress." when he was previously using his own CMS [[Red Wind]], later [[Known]], and the spate of non-English (Kyle always posted in English) spam keyword and link posts near the bottom, key zombie indications.

=== How to repair ===
When you find a zombie site related to the IndieWeb, after confirming with folks, and perhaps adding it to the list on this page, replace links to it on the wiki with Internet Archive versions if available.

Well, @shootingthemess wrote a fascinating piece about how what's found at links in major media articles can be resold (!) for spam and fraud https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/links-for-sale-on-major-news-wesbites" [http://www.jz.org @zittrain] May 21, 2021
