A '''<dfn>zombie</dfn>''' in the context of the web is a website that has [[site-deaths|died]] or been [[lost sites|lost]], perhaps due to [[lost sites|domain registration neglect]], and has been brought back online in a form resembling what it look like before, yet oddly broken, often with spam pages/links added, and sometimes eats a lot of CPU likely due to abusive scripts.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Unfortunate examples of past IndieWeb sites that died and had their domains repurposed by others:
* [[User:kylewm.com|kylewm.com]] — note: "powered by WordPress." when he was previously using his own CMS [[Red Wind]], later [[Known]], and the spate of non-English (Kyle always posted in English) spam keyword and link posts near the bottom, key zombie indications.

== Other Examples ==
* <nowiki>diveintopython.net</nowiki> — possible alternatives: diveintopython3.net, diveintopython.org (Drupal site, could be a clone, or could be a zombie, needs investigation), diveinto.org/python3/table-of-contents.html or check for other mirrors via: https://github.com/diveintomark
* [[Portable Contacts|portablecontacts.net]]
* [[TUAW.com]]

=== How to repair ===
When you find a zombie site related to the IndieWeb, after confirming with folks, and perhaps adding it to the list on this page, replace links to it on the wiki with Internet Archive versions if available.
