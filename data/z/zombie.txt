{{stub}}

'''<dfn>zombie</dfn>''' is in the context of the web a website that had died ([[site-deaths]]), perhaps due to domain registration neglect, and has been brought back by some other looking sorta like it did before, but oddly broken, often with spam pages/links added, and eats a lot of CPU likely due to abusive scripts.
