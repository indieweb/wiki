'''<dfn>private profile</dfn>''' is a feature of some silos (like [[Facebook]]) which allows a user to make their profile accessible only to friends. Related but quite different: A [[private account]] has all [[private posts]], but has a limited public profile including name, icon, bio, and the ability to request following.
