=== David Shanske ===

* 2016-12-06 
** Committing to shipping version 3.0.0 of the Simple Location plugin before the end of 2017-01-01. This was originally supposed to occur over a year ago, and include full venue support. Due to the delay on the project, committing to releasing a substantially improved version, even if full venue support does not get in to this release. This is the location code used by my WordPress site currently, but does have a fair amount of limitations.
*** Shipped version 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 due issues on 2017-01-01 and updated posts on personal website to enhance display.
** Submit improvements to WordPress plugins based on new features of WordPress 4.7.

** My 2017-01-01 commitment is to complete my rewrite of Micropublish (my Micropub client) to support updates, deletes and undeletes. My site's endpoint supports these methods so I now need to bring my client up to date.
* [https://barryfrost.com/2016/12/micropublish-2 2016-12-31]
** Micropublish 2 is now live, just in time! Try it at [https://micropublish.net micropublish.net].

* [https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/2017-indieweb-commitments 2017-indieweb-commitments]
* fix responsive images height issue: currently my responsive images don’t know their heights and so cause flow when they load. This interferes with fragmention for instance.
* develop a mf2-format for a bibliography to represent metadata of scientific papers in HTML+mf2. Use it to get better representation of data on https://kartikprabhu.com/papers. Prior-art: bibtex format, Atom/RSS from http://arxiv.org, others?
