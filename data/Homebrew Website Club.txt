<dfn>'''Homebrew Website Club'''</dfn> is a bi-weekly meetup of people passionate about or interested in creating, improving, building, designing their own website, in the same structure as the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] meetings.

== Description ==
Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy?

If so, you might like to come to a gathering of people with like-minded interests. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project, whatever...

== Meetings ==
Meetings take place '''every other Wednesday right after work, 18:30-19:30'''. If it collides with an official holiday, simply skip that one and resume two weeks later as usual.

See [[events]] for specific dates/locations/URLs of upcoming meetings, or this handy summary of upcoming/past dates:

== Structure ==
Organizers, use the following to keep your Homebrew Website Club meetups on time and on track.

'''Remember to take and post a photo to the event page!'''

=== Beforehand ===
* Get a venue!
* Post an indie [[event]] for your specific meeting city (at your specific venue - if you have one, otherwise post anyway, and add venue when you get it)
** Link to the indiewebcamp wiki page for the event, e.g. like: <blockquote>More information: https://indiewebcamp.com/events/2015-05-20-homebrew-website-club </blockquote>
* Post a [[Facebook]] [[POSSE]] copy of the indie event, or just a plain FB event if you have no indie event
** Set the event header photo to this PNG: [http://indiewebcamp.com/images/5/5d/im-attending-indiewebcamp.png]
** Link to the indiewebcamp wiki page for the event, e.g. like: <blockquote>More information: https://indiewebcamp.com/events/2015-05-20-homebrew-website-club </blockquote>
* Invite everyone who attended previous Homebrew Website Club meetups in your city, and those you've invited before, and any friends you know who may be interested in having their own website, or upgrading their blog etc.

=== Setup ===
* 17:00 arrive at the venue and:
** make sure there is suitable seating for those that have RSVPd
** make or bring a sign that clearly indicates the presence of an IndieWebCamp Homebrew Website Club meeting. If you come up with a nice sign design, please upload it to the wiki!

* 17:20 put the sign out (or put up the IndieWebCamp logo on monitors in the space if any)
** save seats for at least a few of the folks who RSVPd
** consider setting aside a separate room or space for "Conversation Corner" for those that can't help but want to carry on a conversation during Quiet Writing Hour!

* 17:25 test your projector setup to make sure people can show demos of their sites during the "Broadcast" half-hour from 18:30-19:30.

=== Quiet Writing Hour ===
* '''17:30-18:30 optional Quiet Writing Hour''': some locations have started hosting a quiet writing hour from 17:30-18:30 immediately before the meetup itself.
=== HWC Broadcast ===
* '''18:30-19:00: Broadcast''' - take turns with the microphone 1-2 minutes on:
* if this is your first time, introduce yourself, name, URL, what you'd like to do next with your personal site.
* something '''new you created on or for your site''' since the last time you attended
* '''questions''' about anything you're stuck on '''about your personal site'''
* '''notable''' indieweb / ownyourdata related '''press''' / events
=== HWC Group Photo ===
* '''~19:00: Group photo''' - organizers should call time on the "broadcast" phase and then organize and take a group photo to upload to the wiki and embed in the "Photos" section on the page for the specific event. This also helps break-up existing sitting patterns and gives people a chance to move around.
=== HWC Peer to Peer ===
* '''~19:00-19:30: Peer-to-peer''' - encourage everyone to find others they heard in the previous half hour that were interested in similar topics. Help newcomers with [[getting started]] with their personal sites, and hopefully even logging into the wiki and adding themselves to the RSVP section for the meeting!
=== HWC Group Photo 2 ===
* '''~19:30: Group photo''' - If you forgot to take a group photo, or anyone new showed up, use the end of the peer-to-peer session as an opportunity to take another group photo.
=== HWC Clean-up and close ===
* '''~19:45-20:00: Clean-up and meeting closure''' - get everyone to help clean-up and leave the meeting space cleaner than they found it (BarCamp style). Encourage folks to continue discussions at a nearby pub or cafe and get food/drink too!

== Planning Questions ==
In rough order of when a co-organizer might encounter these:
=== Finding a venue ===
How do I find a venue?
* Check out cafes that have an environment where people are sparse and the cafe is ok with hanging out with laptops for an hour or two.

What kind of food venue is works well?
* Cafe style is best, where you order at the counter separately, and can come and go independently.
* Wifi is a nice to have (or get someone to bring a mifi hotspot and share)
* Power outlets are also a nice to have

=== Adding to the wiki ===
How should a co-organizer add a HWC-event to the wiki?

* Two choices:
*# If your HWC is (preferably) on the same date as the "usual" HWC, add your city to the existing event page!
*# Otherwise if your HWC meetup is on a different date, then clone an existing HWC event page, change details as needed for yours, and [https://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?title=Template:Homebrew_Website_Club&action=edit add it to the index on Homebrew_Website_Club]

And then follow:
* [[Events#How_To_Add_An_Event]]

=== Promoting a HWC event ===
How do I promote an HWC event? 
* Invite participants from previous HWC events in the same city.
* Invite participants from [[IndieWebCamps]] from that city

=== What to bring ===
What should I bring to the meetup?
* A sign saying Homebrew Website Club might be helpful

=== Ask Organizers ===
Got more questions?
* Ask active community members who (help) organize (or have organized) Homebrew Website Club meetups, e.g. in IRC, or in-person at a meetup!
