* Displaying HTML content from external sites (feeds, webmention, etc.) posses a security risk.
* Prefer plaintext. What does this mean though? Stirpping HTML? Encoding it?
* Whats the right way to [[sanitize]] external content?
* Converting to plaintext mean loss of context (links, microformats, etc.). how do we deal with this?
** Here is an example of loss of context
*** Original post: http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1337/
*** After sending the webmention, here is what it looks like: http://eschnou.com/entry/testing-indieweb-federation-with-waterpigscouk-aaronpareckicom-and--62-24908.html
*** Here is what it looks like on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BarnabyWalters/status/326620669167161344
** To me ([[User:Sandeep.io|sandeepshetty]]) this is not acceptable. This is why I prefer syndicating Markdown (or a similar replacement) over HTML to Twitter and will also consider doing the same with (hidden) p-* properties of h-entry on http://sandeep.io.
*** See [http://www.sandeep.io/48 Microformats Plaintext Strategy]
** Apart from markdown, machinetags could also be used to provide context.
* Almost all social networks (tiwtter, facebook, google+) support only plaintext content as opposed to blogs that primarily used HTML.

== Tips ==
* If you are expecting plaintext always encode it while displaying (using something like [http://php.net/htmlentities htmlentities]?)


== Experiments ==
=== Machine tags based repost ===
[[User:Sandeep.io|sandeepshetty]] is currently experimenting with machinetags for providing context to reposts. The idea is to provide a rich repost UX to a post that has machinetags (that are generated from a reposting interface that picks up microformats from the original post).
