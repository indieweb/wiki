[[Category:IndieWeb Gift Calendar]]

The '''<dfn>IndieWeb Gift Calendar</dfn>''' is an annual group effort to ship one or more IndieWeb-related thing(s) each day of December that others can use to improve their IndieWeb experience. 

Want to make something just for yourself instead? That’s cool too! Add yourself to:
* [[2021-01-01-commitments]]

__TOC__
Welcome to the 4th annual '''IndieWeb Gift Calendar'''! Anyone can participate, and if you’re looking for ideas, see the '''[[#Inspiration|Inspiration section below]]'''. 
* See [[2019-12-indieweb-challenge|last year’s gift calendar]] for specific examples.

Please keep in mind the '''[[#Considerations|Considerations]]''' and if you’re not sure, you may want to first make a [[2021-01-01-commitments|commitment for yourself]] (and follow through) to ship something you’ll use on your own site, as it will likely help reveal ways to improve things for the community as a whole that others can also use.

Once you've finished something, write a short blog post and link to it in the calendar below!

== Considerations ==
Gifts can be anything from major [[wikify|wiki documentation contributions / improvements]] to shipping updates on any of the IndieWeb applications (like [[social reader]]s), [[services]], [[CMS]]s, [[plugin]]s, [https://github.com/indieweb community libraries], or any other projects in use by multiple folks. 

Please keep in mind the following considerations when adding something to a day:
* It must be shipping / usable, not just a blog post announcing / saying you plan to do it.
* Is it clear what your thing does?
* Is it clear how someone is supposed to use it or otherwise benefit from it?
* What use-case does it solve for others (besides yourself)? Ask yourself, how would/could someone else in the community use the thing I'm posting? 
* If it's a markup / styling example, is it clear what its purpose is, and how someone could/should copy the markup/styling and customize it for their own site?
* If it's a programming example, is it clear how an indieweb site could use the code, using what language(s)? Does it require any frameworks?
* If it's a code example or project, is it clearly open sourced, with a clear link to its GitHub or other code repo that has at least a README explaining how it can be used for either direct user benefit or to enhance existing indieweb sites?

== Inspiration ==
Looking for something to do to benefit the community?

In general (feel free to add things here that you find inspiring in general, or hope someone else is inspired to do :)
* '''[[to-do]]''' and look for something you can do in a day!
* look for easy [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues IndieWebify issues] to fix, fix one, and get an update deployed
* New release of [[microformats2]] parser(s)
** php-mf2
** ...
* Work on [[2020-review]] and previous years that weren't completed
* ...

Specific inspirations:
* {{t}}: In addition to [[to-do]] items I've added (which anyone should feel free to snipe), I want to:
** Update https://2020.indieweb.org/
** Update [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing mf2 parsing spec] with resolved issues
** Move [https://github.com/microformats/microformats2-parsing/issues/ mf2 issues] forward in state per the mf2 parsing spec change process
*** Determine set of GitHub Labels for mf2 issues based on [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing#change_control mf2 parsing spec change process] (similar to / re-use from [https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels those on the CSSWG repo]), consider also what labels would help [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#change_control h-entry change process].
*** Add minimum necessary Labels to the mf2 issues repo to capture and make explicit issue / change proposal stages / next action needed / waiting for.
*** Use space separated labels using underscores in hashtags per [[Falcon#tags_with_spaces|Falcon working on: tags with spaces]] to add labels in reply posts to GitHub issues on CSSWG, mf2 repos
* {{gRegor}}: I'm interested in getting a new release of [[php-mf2]] out.
** I have a handful of pull requests that have been reviewed but not merged, if another contributor could double check those and merge that would be much appreciated
** Are there any other open issues we can quickly fix and merge before the release?
* {{fluffy}} I'd love to work with someone to get [[IndieAuth Ticket Auth]] in a usable state.
** Add the TicketAuth bearer token flow to Publ
** Add a TicketAuth endpoint to... something? Maybe a microsub implementation?
* {{jamietanna}} may look at writing a Java MF2 parser

== In progress ==
Got something you're working on for the IndieWeb Gift Calendar but it's not quite complete or ready for community re-use? Feel free to link to it here while you're working on it, especially if you'd like others to review it, provide feedback etc.

* ...

== Brainstorming ==
* {{aaronpk}} is considering (finally) launching a replacement to [[indieauth.com]] by making a small amount of progress every day in December
* ...
