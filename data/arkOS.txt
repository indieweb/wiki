'''<dfn>[https://arkos.io/ arkOS]</dfn>''' is a software stack designed to make the installation and management of self-hosted services such as email, web servers, or a private cloud easy and intuitive. arkOS focuses on saving data on user-owned hardware and currently supports Raspberry Pi, Cubieboard, and BeagleBone as platforms.

The arkOS software stack encompasses a number of different projects:
* A Linux distribution that handles setup onto a supported device through a custom installer

arkOS underwent a successful crowdfunding campaign in December 2013 and is still being actively developed.
