Outline to call a person (request a voice or video session) using their website:

# tantek writes a post on his site that says "hey <a href="http://aaronparecki.com">aaronpk</a>, do you have a minute to talk? https://talky.io/ttk"
# tantek's server sends a webmention to mine for that link
# my server notifies my phone via a push notification (possibly via [[mention-app]])
# I see the message, click the talky URL, and we're in a video call

Additionally, this could happen with [[private posts]] so the talky URL is only visible to the two of us.
