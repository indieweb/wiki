Tantek described these as the "lighter" responses -- things short of a comment/reply.  "Likes" are fairly universal examples of reactions.

'''Currently the term "[[response]]" is preferred as an umbrella term for referring to likes, reposts, relies, and all manner of other reactions and interactions with another post.'''
