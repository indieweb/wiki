'''<dfn>100DaysOfIndieWeb</dfn>''' is a challenge to ship something IndieWeb-related every day for 100 days. The challenge can be started at any time, and all you have to do is commit to starting, and then make a post every day with the #100DaysOfIndieWeb tag on your personal website when you finish something for that day. Each project can be as small as you want, but must be something you can demonstrate in a screenshot or video. Inspired by the [http://the100dayproject.com/ 100DayProject]: <blockquote><p>How do you start?<br/>Decide to do a 100 day project. Pick a start date -- and an ending date 100 days later. Then do one thing a day for 100 days (mornings are especially good).</p><p>Do something quick, creative, and do it without fear. Don't think too much, or better yet, don't think at all! See where it leads. </p></blockquote>

The only requirements for each indieweb "thing" is:
* It must be something [[selfdogfood|you use yourself]]
* It must be something with a publicly visible result (e.g. has a visible effect on the presentation of your web page, or is an improvement to an open source tool)

== How to ==
How to do 100 days of indieweb:
* every day (before 10-11am ({{aaronpk}}'s approach))
* make something indieweb-related that you will use immediately (selfdogfood)
** It's okay if it'a a super tiny change! 
* When you finish, post a screenshot or video demonstrating the change to your website, and tag it with "100DaysOfIndieWeb" and "indieweb".
** Optional: start post (name or content) with "Day N: " where N is 1 to 100, representing the day and post number for your "100 days of " series.

If you have a page that aggregates all your posts with a tag, then you already have a URL you can use to share your results. Otherwise, find some other way to collect all your posts into a page on your website or your wiki user page.

== Brainstorming ==
=== More 100 days projects ===
Additional 100 days projects to consider:
* '''100 days of blogging''' â€” actual [[article]] posts, not just notes, on specific atomic subjects)
** obviously can build on any other 100 days project because you can blog about that day's project
* '''100 days of positive news''' â€” find and post a link (citation) to a positive news article published that same day, to help counteract the [http://tantek.com/2016/042/t1/the-problem-to-solve-negative-news counterproductive impacts of negative news]
* '''100 days of [[photo]]s''' â€” take and post a photo every day
** '''100 days of positive [[photo]]s''' â€” post a positive photo as your first post in a day, for 100 days. Ok to also post negative / critical photos, just make sure the first photo you post on a day is positive.
* '''100 days of discardia''' â€” donate, sell or otherwise get rid of some physical object in your life at least one per day. Keep a one in one out rule for any acquisitions which then don't count towards this goal so you keep reducing # of total objects each day.
* '''100 days of closing tabs''' â€” for those of us with >100 tabs open across our browsers, process/close (at least) one tab per day, and write about why you think you had it open, what action you took accordingly. Similarly, close any tabs you open during the project, and don't count those towards the goal.
* '''100 days of Wikipedia contributions''' â€” contribute at least one meaningful sentence or paragraph (or a whole article) to Wikipedia each day. Keep track of your additions, and see how many have "stuck" after 100 days.
* '''100 days of yoga poses''' â€” do a different yoga pose each day, and post a photo of it (variant of 100 days of photos)
* '''100 days of origami''' â€” make a different origami each day, and post a photo of it
* '''100 days of 10 origami cranes''' â€” make 10 origami peace cranes each day, and post a photo of the full set in progress, finishing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_origami_cranes 1000 origami cranes] in total
* '''100 days of deleting accounts''' â€” delete one [[silo]] account a day (not counting any you sign-up for), post about it, and add it to [[silo-quits]].
** {{t}} seriously considering for 2018-01-01, though harder than deleting apps (would want to document data-retention policies, how to delete all silo data, screenshots etc.)
* '''100 days of deleting native apps''' â€” delete one native [[app]] a day from your ([[mobile]]) device, optionally replacing its usage with a web app, post about what you're deleting and what you're replacing it with, and add it to [[app-quits]].
** {{t}} seriously considering for 2018-01-01
** {{eddiehinkle.com}} planning to participate starting 2018-01-01
* '''100 days of docs''' â€” each day, improve (or create!) documentation for something (could be open-source projects you use or have made, could be things you do or have figured out that aren't well-described somewhere else)
* ...


If you consider yourself more an idea person than a builder:
* '''100 days of coming up with 100 days projects''' â€” post (or add, e.g. here in Brainstorming) a new specific 100 days project that seems at least reasonably feasible, perhaps something you might even do (on its own).

If you have LOTS of time on your hands:
* '''100 days of starting 100 days projects''' â€” start a new 100 days project each day for 100 days. Yes that means on day 100 of this project you will be doing 100 *different* individual projects if you're able to keep up, then it will decrease by 1 each day until you're finished with the 100th day of the 100th project on day 199.

=== Other Durations ===
These may be deserving of a separate article themselves, or perhaps a more general "n days goal" page which links to and summarizes this page and the other (perhaps seasonal) durations.

==== 30 Days ====
If 100 days seems to intimidating, perhaps start with a smaller number like 30 days as a goal. E.g.
* [[2017-12-indieweb-challenge]]
*# https://chat.indieweb.org/ - now with "Join" buttons for every channel! Thanks {{aaronpk}}!
*# [[Semantic Linkbacks]] v 3.7.0 stable and ready for review! Thanks {{gwg}}!

* ...
* See [https://www.google.com/search?q=30+day+challenge 30 Day challenge] for more ideas
* ...

==== 24 Days ====
24 days is another pre-existing (if seasonal) duration of "do something every day". E.g.
