== IndieWeb Discoverability ==

=== u-client-id ===

One way of adding discoverability of tools used to post eg. WebMentions is to add a u-client-id linking to the page of the app and possibly mark up that page using [[h-x-app]].

WebMention endpoints can then chose to present the client with name and link in relation to mentions, to thus make tools like [[Bridgy]] more discoverable.

== Silo Disoverability ==

=== App Stores ===

See [[store]].

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] saves the application used to tweet something and previously showed the application name, linking to the application page, on every tweet page. The data is still exposed in third-party clients like Tweetbot for iPhone.
