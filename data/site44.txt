http://site44.com is a commercial [[Pancake.io]] clone. It has exactly the same functionality, even looks very similar, so one would expect it to be the same system, but Site44 claims not be connected with pancake.io. However, site44 is commercial. Site44, just like pancake.io looks abandoned, but doesn't seem to be, you get response from humans. Their blog posts are also ~2 years old. The one and only important feature that is missing in Site44 that is actually working (sort-of) with pancake.io, is that pancake.io can connect with your entire [[dropbox]], which then allows you to share a folder, allowing collaborate editing, which is one of the key ideas behind using dropbox as a web hosting service, one would assume. However, Site44 restricts itself to a folder under Apps that then cannot be shared, in order words, Site44 seems stable and fast, but you have to pay for it and you can only edit the contents of a dropbox folder that is displayed on the web yourself. Collaborative editing might be added sometime in the future, Site44 says.
