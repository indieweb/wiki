[http://seenthis.net/ Seenthis] is a [[common]] ([http://seenthis.net/messages/216935 reference]) that host content and help people curating it by using [[hashtags]].

== From there website: ==
"Short-blogging with no text limit. Curation and web survey. Cool automatic text layout. Forums under each post. Advanced and automatic thematisation."

It is interesting because you can comment on links, and by adding [[hashtags]], it creates automatically a forum, or [[group]], on this topic.
