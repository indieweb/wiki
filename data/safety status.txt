'''<dfn>safety status</dfn>''' is a particular type of post (with a permalink) that indicates a person's safety during a disaster event and can be posted by a person or by one of their friends. Such posts are typically shown as a [[marked safe]] notification to [[followers]], and aggregated on a [[safety check]] page.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has supported safety status [[posts]] since 2013?

People or their friends can mark themselves as safe, which creates a "safety status" post on their profile page with its own permalink, like and comment webactions, and comment thread underneath.

Example permalinks (may only be visible to logged in users, and even then, friends of those marked safe)
