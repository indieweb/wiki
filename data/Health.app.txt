    '''<dfn>Health.app</dfn>''' is a build in iOS app by Apple that collects health data from other apps. 

Health.app allows data to be exported, so one really owns all the data in there, which means any application that adds data to Health.app, like sleep data, makes that data truly yours. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-02-10#t1486733628631000 chat]
