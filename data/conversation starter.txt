{{stub}}

If someone wants to start a public conversation with someone else then the first person has to target the other through eg. a [[homepage#Webmention_to_homepage|Homepage Webmention]].

On eg. [[Twitter]] one typically creates a new tweet that mimics that of a [[reply]] by starting with "@username", but which isn't actually a reply to a specific post by that user. See eg: https://twitter.com/voxpelli/status/581565794749964288
