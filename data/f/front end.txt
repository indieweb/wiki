'''<dfn>Front end</dfn>''' is a technical term usually meant to represent the [[user-interface]] (aka UI) layer of a technology stack with which [[people]] will interact. This can be thought of as the code that the [[browser]] will display and run when you visit a website. [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[Javascript]] are the primary building tools of a front end.
