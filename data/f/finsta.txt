'''<dfn>finsta</dfn>''' is a portmanteau of fake and [[Instagram]], a typically private pseudonym account that only a few close friends follow, and used to post more informally and frequently, ironically a more “real” presentation of self, without any of the typical Instagram posting conventions or pressures. Contrast with [[rinsta]].
