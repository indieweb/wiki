'''<dfn>finsta</dfn>''' is a portmanteau of fake and [[Instagram]], a typically private pseudonym account that only a few close friends follow, and used to post more informally and frequently, without any of the typical Instagram posting conventions; as few IndieWeb are private, this may be worth exploring. Contrast with [[rinsta]].

* possibly contradictory/reversed-meaning use of finsta/rinsta terms: 2019-10-15 [https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/finsta What's a Finsta? We Explain This Confusing Instagram Trend], e.g. quoting then 16-year old (Gen Z) <blockquote>"My real Instagram account is kind of fake -- like, only pictures of my 'best' life,"</blockquote>…<blockquote>"I use my Finsta to share funny, inside jokes with my closest friends. My real Instagram has like, 400 followers. My fake one only has like, eight."</blockquote> the latter quote strongly implies the "Finsta" is actually more real since presumably its "eight" followers are very close friends that they feel safe/comfortable being more real with.
