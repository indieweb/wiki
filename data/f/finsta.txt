'''<dfn>finsta</dfn>''' is a portmanteau of fake and [[Instagram]], a typically private pseudonym account that only a few close friends follow, and used to post more informally and frequently, without any of the typical Instagram posting conventions; as few IndieWeb are private, this may be worth exploring. Contrast with [[rinsta]].
