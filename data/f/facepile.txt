A <dfn>'''Facepile'''</dfn> is a way of showing interactions for a page/site by using profile pictures. It is a design element popularized by Facebook.

== Description ==

It consists of a row or rows of [[profile photos]] of individuals who have all completed a webaction involving the current page/site. For example, who have all liked, mentioned, favorited, RSVPed, etc. 

== Implementation Notes ==

Software that displays facepiles should take care to display only one image per actor within a given facepile. For instance, someone might, using [[webmention|webmentions]], send two [[like|likes]] from two discrete source URLs to a valid target URL on a website. Rather than display that person's picture twice on that URL's facepile for likes, it should determine that both webmentions came from the same author (using [[authorship|the authorship algorithm]]), and then display that person's image only once within its like-facepile.

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{Sebsel}} uses facepiles to show likes, reposts and bookmarks for his post. For events, he also uses a facepile to show RSVPs.

Likes, reposts and bookmarks are mixed into one pile, but the text above the pile only counts the likes. When there are reposts/bookmarks but no likes, the title will say 'Reposts en bookmarks'.

RSVPs are displayed with an icon indicating 'yes', 'no', 'maybe' or 'interested'. Only the 'yes' value is in color.
