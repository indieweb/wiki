{{stub}}

'''<dfn>footnote</dfn>''' is an inline typographical convention predating the web for indicating more information is available about a word, phrase, or sentence by the use of a superscript (usually a number) immediately after the item, and the presentation of the same superscript followed by a note, often a [[citation]], in the footer of the page, and sometimes used on the web instead of inline hyperlinks to reduce reader distraction.

== Why ==
* Use-case: footnotes help save space when [[POSSE]]ing to text-only (non-HTML) destinations like [[Twitter]]
* Example: [1],[2],...[n] style footnotes are used often in email communications especially in web standards mailing lists like at W3C

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has used ^1 [http://tantek.com/2016/176/t2/ignore-if-not-incubated since 2016] and occasionally Unicode ¹ footnotes manually and unlinked in [[note]] posts [http://tantek.com/2018/296/t1/cindyli since 2018]:
* ^1 example with many ^n: https://tantek.com/2023/029/t1/indieweb-beyond-blogging
* ¹ 2018 example: http://tantek.com/2018/296/t1/cindyli

== Brainstorming ==
=== Convert ASCII to Unicode superscripts ===
Summary: if you use ASCII footnotes like [1] or ^2 when authoring your personal posts, consider auto-Unicoding them to ¹ or ² respectively.

ASCII footnotes like ^1 or [1] are easier to type, yet when inline in prose, can be distracting to readers.

Small superscript numbers like those in print footnotes would be less distracting. 

From an authoring perspective, it’s easier to type ^1 or [1], and they can (should) be converted into either HTML or Unicode superscript numbers.

Since many (most?) syndication destinations do not accept <code><sub></code> or <code><sup></code> elements, Unicode superscript numbers would syndicate better.

Reference: for Unicode superscript numbers for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts#Superscripts_and_subscripts_block
* ⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹

When POSSEing to a plain (non-HTML) text silo (like [[Twitter]], or perhaps [[email]]), use the original ASCII style ^1 or [1] because it’s ok for the POSSE version to not look as nice, and you have no idea if the POSSE destination will use actual superscripts to mean something.

Implementation brainstorms: 
* auto-Unicoding of ASCII style footnotes could be done with a well written regex (TBI), and footnote expansions could be detected with a linebreak before footnote. 
** regex to detect both/either ref & note, then distinguish in code afterwards
** regex: start with '^', 'n', space-or-separation-punctuation (like , : ; ! ?)
*** "^1" should not match
*** "^1, should match
** non-space before '^' -> ref
*** possibly also: non-linebreak-space before '^' -> ref
** linebreak before '^', after 'n': optional-colon space -> note
** else treat as literal text, pass through
* with an optional “fragment_prefix” param to an existing [[autolink]] function, both inline and expansion footnotes could be marked up with unique fragments, and hyperlink to each other
** generate ref frag ID by concatenating prefix param and '_ref-' and number, hyperlink it to its footer expansion
** generate note frag ID by concatenating prefix param and '_note-' and number, add a "⮐" symbol after the note which hyperlinks to its footnote ref

=== Sidenotes ===
* notes/expansions could also be presented as a sidenote in a margin adjacent to the respective in-line reference. see also [[marginalia]]
* [[Tufte_CSS]] has well designed distinctions between side notes and end notes
