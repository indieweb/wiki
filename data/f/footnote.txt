{{stub}}

'''<dfn>footnote</dfn>''' is an inline typographical convention predating the web for indicating more information is available about a word, phrase, or sentence by the use of a superscript (usually a number) immediately after the item, and the presentation of the same superscript followed by a note, often a [[citation]], in the footer of the page, and sometimes used on the web instead of inline hyperlinks to reduce reader distraction.

* Various styles on the web: ASCII (^1 or [1]), Unicode (¹), either of which could themselves be hyperlinked with a fragment to the display of the footnote in the footer.
* Use-case: footnotes help save space when [[POSSE]]ing to text-only (non-HTML) destinations like [[Twitter]]
* Example: [1],[2],...[n] style footnotes are used often in email communications especially in web standards mailing lists like at W3C
* Brainstorming: if you use ASCII footnotes like [1] or ^2 when authoring your personal posts, consider auto-Unicoding them to ¹ or ² respectively.
* ^ reference for Unicode superscripted numbers for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts#Superscripts_and_subscripts_block
* ^ when POSSEing to a plain (non-HTML) text silo (like Twitter, or email maybe), use the original ASCII style ^1 or [1] because it’s ok for the POSSE version to not look as nice, and you have no idea if the POSSE destination will use actual superscripts to mean something.
* brainstorm: auto-unicoding of ASCII style footnotes could be done with a well written regex (TBI), and with an optional “fragment_prefix” param, fragment hyperlink inline instances of footnotes (gen frag ID by strcat prefix+fnum) to their footer expansions (detect as linebreak before footnote ref)
