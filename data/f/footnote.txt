{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>footnote</dfn>''' is an inline typographical convention predating the web for indicating more information is available about a word, phrase, or sentence by the use of a superscript (usually a number) immediately after the item, and the presentation of the same superscript followed by a note, often a [[citation]], in the footer of the page, and sometimes used on the web instead of inline hyperlinks to reduce reader distraction.

== Why ==
Why use footnotes (rather than or in addition to inline hyperlinks) in posts:
* '''Enhance reader-focus & reading flow''' by removing perceived urgency or tempation to click on inline links. Footnotes to links (and other related information) can both complement the use of inline links, and potentially replace them to reduce the temptation to readers to click on links, interrupting their reading flow. For example, as [http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience explicitly noted at the top this post]:
<blockquote>… in-line hyperlink citations[number] are listed in the References footer of this post. You may procrastinate clicking them until the end for a more in-flow reading experience.</blockquote>
* '''Save space in POSSE copies''': Footnotes help save space when [[POSSE]]ing to text-only (non-HTML) destinations like [[Twitter]]

== How to ==
=== How to markup ===
You should markup your footnotes with hyperlinks from each inline reference to the expansion in the footer, and in reverse.

One way to do this is to use fragment IDs and fragment hyperlinks in both directions, made unique by use of a prefix unique to the context of the footnotes (e.g. a <code>shortpath</code> unique to a specific post) and then a string like <code>_ref-</code> or <code>_note-</code> respectively, followed by the number of the footnote.

=== How to style ===
Since typical fonts and even the generic font families of <code>serif</code> and <code>sans-serif</code> fail to display all 10 Unicode superscripts consistently, e.g.:
* ⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹ — How do these look in your browser? Do the 123 look different from 0,4-9?
You must explicitly style the font of footnote references and expansions to use a font-family (and fallback generic) that supports the entire set. If you’ve followed the markup guidance above, you can use a style rule like this:
<blockquote><code>a[id*='_ref-'],a[id*='_note-'] { font-family:"Arial Unicode MS",system-ui; }</code></blockquote>
Here is an inline example of the same series of Unicode numbers as above, styled with that <code>font-family</code>:
* <span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS',system-ui;">⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹</span>
The numbers 0-9 above should be the same size & weight, and all be baseline aligned.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has used "[1]" style footnotes [http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience since at least 2013] in [[article]]s.
* 2013-12-04 [http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience Toward A People Focused Mobile Communication Experience]

Has also used "^1" style footnotes [http://tantek.com/2016/176/t2/ignore-if-not-incubated since 2016] and occasionally Unicode '¹' footnotes manually and unlinked in [[note]] posts [http://tantek.com/2018/296/t1/cindyli since 2018]:
* "^1" example with many ^n: https://tantek.com/2023/029/t1/indieweb-beyond-blogging
* Unicode superscript '¹' 2018 example: http://tantek.com/2018/296/t1/cindyli

== Other Examples ==
[0],[1],[2],...[n] style footnotes are used often in email communications especially in web standards mailing lists like at W3C, [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1995MarApr/0054.html since at least 1995]. E.g.
* Recently: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2023Feb/0002.html
* 1995: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1995MarApr/0054.html

== Brainstorming ==
=== Convert ASCII to Unicode superscripts ===
Summary: if you use ASCII footnotes like [1] or ^2 when authoring your personal posts, consider auto-Unicoding them to ¹ or ² respectively.

ASCII footnotes like ^1 or [1] are easier to type, yet when inline in prose, can be distracting to readers.

Small superscript numbers like those in print footnotes would be less distracting. 

From an authoring perspective, it’s easier to type ^1 or [1], and they can (should) be converted into either HTML or Unicode superscript numbers.

Since many (most?) syndication destinations do not accept <code><nowiki><sub></nowiki></code> or <code><nowiki><sup></nowiki></code> elements, Unicode superscript numbers would syndicate better.

Reference: for Unicode superscript numbers for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts#Superscripts_and_subscripts_block
* ⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹

When POSSEing to a plain (non-HTML) text silo (like [[Twitter]], or perhaps [[email]]), use the original ASCII style ^1 or [1] because it’s ok for the POSSE version to not look as nice, and you have no idea if the POSSE destination will use actual superscripts to mean something.

Implementation brainstorms: 
* auto-Unicoding of ASCII style footnotes could be done with a well written regex (TBI), and footnote expansions could be detected with a linebreak before footnote. 
** regex to detect both/either ref & note, then distinguish in code afterwards
** regex: start with '^', 'n', space-or-separation-punctuation (like , : ; ! ?), similar to a regex looking for @-names or #hashtags, except only including numbers (0-9) after the '^' character.
*** "^1" should be treated as literal text (pass through)
*** "^1, should be treated as a footnote ref
** non-space before '^' -> ref
*** possibly also: non-linebreak-space before '^' -> ref
** linebreak before '^' (maybe also check for: after 'n': optional-colon space) -> note
** else treat as literal text, pass through
* with an optional “fragment_prefix” parameter to an existing [[autolink]] function, both inline and expansion footnotes could be marked up with unique fragments, and hyperlink to each other
** generate ref frag ID by concatenating fragment_prefix and '_ref-' and number, hyperlink it to its footer expansion
** generate note frag ID by concatenating fragment_prefix and '_note-' and number, hyperlink it to its inline ref
*** possibly also (in post-processing outside of autolinking), detect note expansion elements, and  add a "⮐" symbol after the note which hyperlinks to its footnote ref
*** building on that, detect a block of footnote expansions and markup the whole thing as a list

=== Sidenotes ===
* notes/expansions could also be presented as a sidenote in a margin adjacent to the respective in-line reference. see also [[marginalia]]
* [[Tufte_CSS]] has well designed distinctions between side notes and end notes

* FYI: apparently due to inconsistent font support, some combinations of superscript numbers may be misaligned: [https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/issues/190 #190 Possibly incorrect rendering of unicode superscripts in 02.delete-me.md]
