{{stub}}

'''<dfn>footnote</dfn>''' is an inline typographical convention predating the web for indicating more information is available about a word, phrase, or sentence by the use of a superscript (usually a number) immediately after the item, and the presentation of the same superscript followed by a note, often a [[citation]], in the footer of the page, and sometimes used on the web instead of inline hyperlinks to reduce reader distraction.

* Various styles on the web: ASCII (^1 or [1]), Unicode (¹), either of which could themselves be hyperlinked with a fragment to the display of the footnote in the footer.
* Use-case: footnotes help save space when [[POSSE]]ing to text-only (non-HTML) destinations like [[Twitter]]
* Example: [1],[2],...[n] style footnotes are used often in email communications especially in web standards mailing lists like at W3C
* Brainstorming: if you use ASCII footnotes like [1] or ^2 when authoring your personal posts, consider auto-Unicoding them to ¹ or ² respectively.
