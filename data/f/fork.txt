{{stub}}

'''<dfn>fork</dfn>''' is a form of response that is similar to an [[edit]] except with the expectation of diverging from the original rather than suggesting changes to it, and is also like a [[repost]] in that a fork displays most or all of the original likely with its changes made inline. 

== IndieWeb Examples ==
{{gRegor}} forked a [[recipe]]:
* https://gregorlove.com/2017/04/crock-pot-white-chicken-chili/
* Inline changes, with follow-up comment to explain: https://gregorlove.com/2017/04/the-original-recipe-says-to/.

{{eddiehinkle.com}} formed a [[code snippet]] or [[gist]]:
* https://eddiehinkle.com/2019/01/09/13/code/
* experimental markup of u-fork-of with the original code as the url, allows for me to send a webmention back to the original source document and allow it to know I made a fork of it.
* The plan is if I ever receive fork webmentions to be able to display them as well somewhat similar to comments.
