{{stub}}

'''<dfn>fork</dfn>''' is a form of response that is similar to an [[edit]] except with the expectation of diverging from the original rather than suggesting changes to it, and is also like a [[repost]] in that a fork displays most or all of the original likely with its changes made inline.
