'''<dfn>feed discovery</dfn>''' is a way to, given someone's home page, discover their feed or feeds that they publish.

== How to ==
How to discovery someone's feed or feeds from their home page.

Simple version:
* find the first [[h-feed]] on their home page. Use that as the feed.
* if there are no h-feed elements, then use the set of top level h-entry elements (h-entry elements that are themselves not inside another h-entry) as the implied feed on the page.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Off home feeds ===
At [[2015|IndieWebCamp 2015]] {{aaronpk}} and {{jeena}} [[2015/Indieweb_Reader|discussed]] how sometimes they want to publish feed(s) at more deeply nested URLs, yet linked from their home page.

The brainstorm suggestion was to:
* link from your homepage to your h-feed feed pages on other URLs with [[rel-feed]]

* See [[rel-feed#IndieWeb_Examples]] for examples of Indieweb usage
