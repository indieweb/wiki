== Brainstorming ==
=== Why display followers ===
* Displaying the people who follow you could help encourage other people to follow you.

=== Why display followings ===
* Displaying the people you follow could be useful for switching between [[reader]]s without having to re-add everyone
* A public list of people you follow could be sensitive; would be good to curate who is on it rather than have only all-public vs all-private options. - {{rhiaro}}
