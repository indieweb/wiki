== Brainstorming ==
=== Display followers ===
==== Why display followers ====
* Displaying the people who follow you could help encourage other people to follow you.
==== How to display followers ====
When you receive webmentions for [[follow]] posts that are other people following you, keep track those webmentions in their own reverse chronological list in your site storage.

Then you can recreate your own "Followers" page,  very similar to a Twitter followers page (which lists your followers by most recent first), e.g. {{GWG}}'s https://twitter.com/dshanske/followers

=== Display followings ===
==== Why display followings ====
* Displaying the people you follow could be useful for switching between [[reader]]s without having to re-add everyone
* A public list of people you follow could be sensitive; would be good to curate who is on it rather than have only all-public vs all-private options. - {{rhiaro}}

==== How to display followings ====
Merely keeping an archive page of just your own [[follow]] posts is close enough to display a followings page, in reverse chronological order of who you followed most recently first, similar to a Twitter followings page, e.g. {{GWG}}’s https://twitter.com/dshanske/following

=== How to remove yourself from following lists ===
This led to the thought of how do you “unfollow” someone, especially if following lists are used for things like [[Vouch]]? Seems like the simplest thing would be to either delete the follow post or mark the follow post private (so that it is no longer available via webmention), and then send another webmention. This should cause the person who is being followed’s system to delete the original webmention, which means the followers list would no longer show you as a follower.
