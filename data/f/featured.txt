{{stub}}

'''<dfn>featured</dfn>''' is a proposed mf2 property (typically as <code>u-featured</code>) for [[h-entry]] that indicates a representative image for a primarily textual post.

== Why ==
To indicate which image (among many potentially) should be used in [[summaries]] or other [[link-preview]] use-cases for a post.

(A maybe less-obvious example: album cover for an [[audio]] post [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-12-13/line/1450032586853] -- or by extension a representative image for a [[collection]].)

== How ==
Add the class name "u-featured" to the <nowiki><img></nowiki> tag that you want used as the featured image for your post.
