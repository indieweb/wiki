A '''<dfn>forum</dfn>''' is a site to host online discussions, which some IndieWeb communities have hosted. The term may refer to either a set of web forums, or a single forum within a larger set of forums.

Forums were -- and to some degree still are -- popular, independent ways for a community to communicate over the web. In more recent times many forums have been replaced by Facebook groups and more recently [[Discord]], to the detriment of the indieweb.

[[Discourse]] is one of the modern pieces of forum software used in communities such as the Glitch support forum.
