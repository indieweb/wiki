A '''<dfn>forum</dfn>''' refers to either a set of web forums, or a single forum within a larger set of forums.

Forums were -- and to some degree still are -- popular, independent ways for a community to communicate over the web. In more recent forums have been replaced by [[Facebook|Facebook groups]] and more recently [[Discord]], to the detriment of the indieweb.
