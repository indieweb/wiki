<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>The IndieWeb Flag</dfn>''' refers to any flag or large banner-like object made with the Indieweb logo, usually used at Indieweb events.</span> 

Examples of this include {{gwg}}'s Indieweb flag.

Questions include....proper way to hang an Indieweb flag? Orientation, etc. There are legitimate concerns. For example, the Phillipines flag, if turned one way indicates war, the other orientation, peace.
