'''<dfn>featured photos</dfn>''' are a [[profile]] feature that allows the user to pick a few [[photo]]s to show in a box on their profile, supported by [[Facebook]] (since 2016-03-29).

Featured photos are different from a [[featured]] photo in that:
* Featured photos are on a profile. A featured photo is on an article/post.
* Featured photos are typically plural (more than one). A featured photo is singular.

[[Facebook]] seems to have added support for "Featured Photos" on 2016-03-29.

If you go to your own profile URL, you will see a prompt in the left column to "Add Featured Photos" (blue link), below it with a caption "Feature up to 5 photos you love":

After a while, the large preview prompt box disappears and is replaced by a simple blue text link prompt:
