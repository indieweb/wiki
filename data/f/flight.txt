'''<dfn>flight</dfn>''' is a type of [[travel]] post.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has been tracking flights on his personal site [https://aaronparecki.com/flights?before=20131111T180000-0700 since 2013-11-01]
* https://aaronparecki.com/2013/11/01/13/
** showing start and end airports, start and end times with timezone offsets, airline and flight number
* https://aaronparecki.com/2013/11/16/7/
** a flight plan with multiple legs, and differing timezones

== Brainstorming ==
=== Autolink flight codes ===
{{main|autolink#Flight_status_and_tracking}}
Flight codes could be [[auto-link]]ed to the current (todayâ€™s?) flight using two letter airline code and flight number e.g.:
* https://mobile.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/UA/2055
Or for a specific date by appending /YYYY/MM/DD to the end e.g.:
* https://mobile.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/UA/2055/2019/06/24

For more options and further brainstorming, see:
