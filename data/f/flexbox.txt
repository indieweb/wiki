'''<dfn>Flexbox</dfn>''' (or '''CSS Flexible Box Layout''') is a [[CSS]] layout model for aligning and distributing space among items in a container.

Flexbox makes it easier to create complex and responsive layouts with fairly simple CSS rules paired with a simple [[HTML]] structure. It has decent browser support at this point, so why not treat yourself to responsive "holy grail" layouts and sticky footers without the hastle of doing it the old way.

<blockquote>
"The <dfn>Flexbox</dfn> Layout (Flexible Box) module (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex")."
