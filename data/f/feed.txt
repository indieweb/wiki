https://indieweb.org/feed

A '''<dfn>feed</dfn>''' is a dynamic set of [[posts]], typically listed in reverse-chronological order, often only the most recent n (like 10) of them. Homepage feeds usually contain all posts by the author, but many also choose to publish filtered feeds, for example posts of a particular type, or tagged with a particular tag.

Feeds, if correctly marked up, can be subscribed to, parsed and presented by [[readers]].

Historically feeds have been served in separate [[feed file]]s, in specialized XML formats like [[RSS]] or [[Atom]], that are typically polled for updates by [[feed readers]] or [[aggregators]]. Feeds can also be (and are more and more often) served simply as HTML marked up with [[h-feed]]/[[h-entry]], often on an existing page (e.g. [[homepage]]) thus not requiring a separate URL (and all the downsides thereof).

== IndieWeb Examples ==

Many examples of feeds marked up with HTML+microformats can be found, e.g. on [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Examples_in_the_wild h-entry examples in the wild] and [[h-feed#IndieWeb_Examples|h-feed indieweb examples]]. Add yourself below!

=== Aaron Parecki ===
[[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron]] uses [[p3k]] to publish various feeds on [https://aaronparecki.com aaronparecki.com], all marked up with h-entry and h-card:
* [https://aaronparecki.com/ homepage feed] containing all Aaron’s posts apart from responses and metrics
* Content-specific feeds, for example [https://aaronparecki.com/notes notes], [https://aaronparecki.com/articles articles] and [https://aaronparecki.com/replies replies]
* Tag-filtered feeds, for example [http://aaronparecki.com/tag/indieweb #indieweb] — note that this includes not only posts by Aaron but also posts tagged with #indieweb which he’s replied to
* A [http://aaronparecki.com/mentions mentions] feed, of every mention Aaron’s site has received 

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby]] uses [[Taproot]] publishes various feeds on [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk], all marked up with h-feed, h-entry and h-card:
* [http://waterpigs.co.uk homepage feed] containing all Barnaby’s notes (including replies, checkins, photos), articles and tunes
* Content-specific feeds of [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/ notes], [http://waterpigs.co.uk/articles/ articles] and [http://waterpigs.co.uk/music/ music]
* A (currently very ugly --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 05:40, 16 March 2014 (PDT)) [http://waterpigs.co.uk/mentions mentions] feed of all the mentions waterpigs.co.uk has received

=== Tantek ===
[[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]] uses [[Falcon]] to publish h-feed with h-entry recent (20) items  on [http://tantek.com/ tantek.com] using [[Falcon]]. In addition he publishes a legacy Atom feed at tantek.com/updates.atom (reduced to only 3 most recent items as of [http://tantek.com/2013/272/t3/atom-feed-reduced-subscribe-home-page-h-entry 2013-09-29] due to [http://tantek.com/2013/272/t2/atom-inefficient-required-artificial-precision Atom inefficiency]).

== How to ==
The easiest way to mark up, publish and consume feeds is to use HTML+[[microformats2]], specifically the 
[[h-entry]] and [[h-feed]] vocabularies.

=== How to Publish ===
A simple feed can be marked up simply as a page with multiple [[h-entry|h-entries]] on. The h-entries should be marked up in the same way they’re marked up on [[post]] permalink pages, although most people choose to leave comments/mentions out in feeds, instead showing comment/like/repost counts. For example:

<pre>
<article class="h-entry">
  <p class="p-author h-card">Barnaby Walters</p>
  <div class="e-content">Good grief the weather here changes quickly. sun/hail/snow/sun/rain/snow/sun in 1hr</div>
  <p><time class="dt-published">2014-03-12 12:00:16+00:00</time></p>
</article>
<article class="h-entry">
  •••
</article>
•
•
•
</pre>

It is recommended that you also wrap the h-entries in an '''[[h-feed]]''' to make it easier for consuming applications to interpret your page. 

In addition, consider adding support for [[PuSH]] notifications to turn your feed into a real-time [[stream]] for PuSH subscribers.

=== How To Test ===
* https://indiewebify.me
* [[authorship testing tool]] - test the [[authorship]] for [[h-feed]]
* [http://www.feedbucket.com/ FeedBucket] will let you preview an Atom and RSS feed
* [https://www.coderedcorp.com/tools/rss-preview/ CodeRed] has a tool for previewing Atom and RSS feeds

'''Previously'''
* [[Shrewdness]] had a feed testing interface which you could use to test your feed pages: (not functioning as of 2015-12-29)

** [http://shrewdness.waterpigs.co.uk/test/?url=http%3A%2F%2Faaronparecki.com%2Fnotes example]

=== How To Consume ===
With microformats2 [[h-entry]], generic [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2#implementations microformats2 parsers], you can get a JSON representation of any HTML page instead of relying on a separate XML feed.

Use the following algorithm to get feed posts and details for a page:
* Look for the first h-feed. If one is found:
** let the feed name be the '''name''' property of the h-feed
** let the default author of posts in the feed be the '''author''' property of the h-feed, if it exists
** let the posts in the feed be any h-entry children of the h-feed
* otherwise, let the name of the feed be the value of the <code><title></code> of the page
* let the default author be the [[representative h-card]] found on the page
* let the posts in the feed be any h-entries found on the page
* to find earlier/later posts from the same feed, look for rel=prev[ious] and rel=next URLs, parse them in the same way
* Use the [[h-entry#How_to_consume_h-entry|h-entry consumption]] algorithm to process each h-entry found in the feed

If you don't find a feed on a page, or want to discover all available feeds, look for a property in the '''rels''' object named '''feed'''. You can then repeat this process with any urls provided in this array (you probably want to de-dup it first).

__TOC__

== Past Work ==
There is a long history ([[timeline#1997|since 1997]]) of the development of feeds, most of which has died to due the widespread abandonment of XML as a foundation of anything actually served on the web (largely replaced by HTML and JSON).

There is however still some inertial legacy XML support, some of which you may find sufficiently useful to implement — see [[feed#Backward Compatibility|backward compatibility]].

=== Criticism ===
XML feeds like RSS and Atom are known to be problematic for a variety of reasons, here are a few.
* '''[[DRY]] violation''' - feed/post content is typically already visible on HTML pages, thus the XML version is a (sometimes lower fidelity even) duplicate.
** [http://rssdateformats.tumblr.com/ RSS Date Formats] blog documents the many hilarious ways people publish date-times in RSS/Atom feeds.
* '''Bad RSS link User Experience''' - visiting a link to an RSS or Atom feed results in seeing a pile of XML in the browser. There have been [https://mondaybynoon.com/beginning-to-style-your-rss-feed/ attempts] to make the XML more presentable using XSLT and CSS, basically resulting in what looks like a web page
* '''Maintenance tax''' - added maintenance cost of separate code path for generating XML, coercing embedded content to be XML-friendly, validating, testing etc.
* '''Inefficient code to generate'''[http://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/001969.html] (perhaps because extra code to support them was hastily written due to being lower priority than visible HTML)
* '''Dated - not rich enough''' - "RSS and Atom are not rich enough to describe the kind of social web activities that we have today" — [http://tantek.com/2013/169/t5/rss-atom-not-rich-enough-social-web-osb2013]
* '''Atom feed files many times larger than equivalent HTML''' - An Atom feed file is up to (maybe greater than) 4.5x the size of the equivalent HTML+microformats file.[http://tantek.com/2013/272/t1/exceeded-monthly-bandwidth-culprit-atom]
** When the HTML is split into separate files for each post, that plus the index is still barely bigger than a single Atom file.[http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/atom-vs-hfeed-size.htm]. 
** When a single Atom file is compared to the equivalent single HTML file, whether for one post, or for many posts, in that one file, the Atom file is significantly bigger. 
** For text notes, an Atom file is a <em>multiple</em> of the size of the equivalent HTML file.
* '''Consuming feed files is problematic and fragile.''' Consuming ATOM or RSS has been shown to be problematic and fragile — one of the creators of NewsGator documented [http://inessential.com/2013/03/18/brians_stupid_feed_tricks 40+ common problems with feeds], most of which don’t happen when consuming visible HTML web pages (e.g. marked up with [[h-entry]]). Some of them still might, but in general most of them either don't, or are quickly automatically fixed because, well, people (including readers of a site) notice that visible HTML is broken and it typically gets fixed quite quickly.

All of the above should not obliterate the fact that RSS can be used a signal for new content and as a failover mechanism when microformats or other richer format is not available.

=== Backward Compatibility ===
There are legacy systems, e.g. some [[feed readers]], which only support older technologies such as XML-based feeds. For backward compatibility with those you may want to consider publishing the following:
* [[Atom]]
** Atom [[ActivityStreams]] object-type annotations, e.g. inside entry elements: <blockquote><nowiki><object-type xmlns="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/">http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/note</object-type></nowiki></blockquote> or <blockquote><nowiki><object-type xmlns="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/">http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/article</object-type></nowiki></blockquote> for the [[note]] and [[article]] post types respectively.
*** (any known live Atom ActivityStreams consumers?)
