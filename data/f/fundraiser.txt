'''<dfn>fundraiser</dfn>''' is a type of post similar to an [[event]] that encourages readers to donate/donation in response to it, supported by at least [[Facebook]].

{{main|Facebook Fundraisers}}
Facebook allows you to create a new fundraiser post, and has some UI prompts (screenshot?) for doing so for your birthday to request an alternative to receiving personal gifts. See [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-08-18#t1503085686502000 text description in IRC] (and perhaps add here as an ASCII art mockup?)

Fundraiser posts by friends show up explicitly in your Facebook notifications:

(need screenshot of an actual fundraiser post - that one was "friends only" so no screenshot)

=== Tilt ===
(this section is a stub and needs examples / screenshots)

[[Tilt]] is a fundraising silo.
