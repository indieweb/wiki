'''<dfn>former projects</dfn>''' are [[projects]] that may have been used by indieweb community members in the past, but have either been abandoned, or failed to implement any key indieweb [[building blocks]] — if you’re actively using one of these for your primary personal site, please add yourself to its specific page, and bring it up on the #indieweb-dev [[chat]] channel!


== Abandoned ==
Projects that may have supported IndieWeb sites in the past but that appear to be abandoned. In alphabetical order by project name.
* [[Converspace]]
* [[Federated Community]] - please move the below details to the [[Federated Community]] page and replace with a short one-line summary: 
** The idea here is to use pop-based email, generic Python scripting, and static HTML to set up a dynamic microblogging and photohosting site. Current workflow includes sending an email to a pop email account. Then when the Python script finds the new email it downloads the email to my static HTML server and also sends out an email to my facebook and twitter accounts for syndication. Currently, the Python script is located [https://github.com/geo-gs/federatedcommunity/tree/python here] and an example of the static HTML is located [https://github.com/geo-gs/gcarlson.github.com here]. Next up is adding in the ability to upload photo albums. After that, comments. Former user: [[User:Geo.gs|George Em]] on <nowiki>geo.gs</nowiki> (dead link 2018)
* [[Glow]]
* [[Pants]]
* [[Social Igniter]]
* [[Storytlr]] an open-source lifestreaming platform.
* [[TropoVBX]] - Self-hosted phone numbers! (please move the below details to the [[TropoVBX]] page)
** https://github.com/disruptiveio/TropoVBX - appears untouched for 7 years (2018)
** site <nowiki>http://openvbx.org/</nowiki> for OpenVBX died/acquired at some point, now just redirects to [[Twilio]].
** IndieWebCamp participants who used it in the past:
*** Aaron Parecki (2011-2012) - Technically it's not web, though it is installed on a web server and has an HTTP API. The real reason I listed it is because I feel the lines between phone and Internet communication are blurring, and this will become more important in the future. -[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaronparecki.com]] 08:37, 17 August 2012 (PDT)

== Unmaintained ==

An open-source tumblr/blog/rss reader/wordpress-like thingy.  Post your content easily and collect content from other rss/ostatus capable sites.
