'''<dfn>former projects</dfn>''' are [[projects]] that may have been used by indieweb community members in the past, but are either unmaintained, have been abandoned, or failed to implement any key indieweb [[building blocks]] — if you’re actively using one of these for your primary personal site, please add yourself to its specific page, and bring it up on the #indieweb-dev [[chat]] channel!

== Brainstorming ==
=== Page Update ===
This page needs updating to provide a more useful sorting of former projects. A few thoughts ({{t}}):

* start with a section of projects that might still be useful to folks, by merit of their past utility (functionality), and past set of community members that used them
** These could reasonably be labeled '''Unmaintained'''
* It would useful to distinguish single-user indieweb projects (abandoned by the one person who was primarily developing & using it), from projects which had multiple participants and users 
** '''Abandoned''' since it was a clear choice by the single user/developer to give up on it, perhaps help provide motivation to new devs to not just try creating something on their own (by evidence of past efforts that attempted that).
* Projects where there is no sign of open source or project site (or it died) should perhaps go on an even separate page, since there's nothing that a new person can really do with them, they’re historical at best
** This make may make sense for '''Unreachable''', or perhaps even move them to a separate [[project-deaths]] page.

Once we've figured out how to distinguish different former projects, then we go through the existing lists and reorganize them accordingly.

Another way of separating projects, there is a possible distinction between abandoned projects that were:
* "indieweb usable"
** Readers, like full on readers like Woodwind
** CMS projects, that people in the community actually used on their own sites
** some subset of both of those that were only ever "single user"
* "indieweb tangential" (like libraries that could be used as part of an indieweb supporting CMS etc.)
* "other" that didn't really try to support Indieweb building blocks, perhaps worth moving to their own page

== Abandoned ==
Projects that may have supported IndieWeb sites in the past but that appear to be abandoned. In alphabetical order by project name.
* [[Converspace]]
* "Federated Community" - The idea here is to use pop-based email, generic Python scripting, and static HTML to set up a dynamic microblogging and photohosting site. Current workflow includes sending an email to a pop email account. Then when the Python script finds the new email it downloads the email to my static HTML server and also sends out an email to my facebook and twitter accounts for syndication. Currently, the Python script is located [https://github.com/geo-gs/federatedcommunity/tree/python here] and an example of the static HTML is located [https://github.com/geo-gs/gcarlson.github.com here]. Next up is adding in the ability to upload photo albums. After that, comments. Former user: [[User:Geo.gs|George Em]] on <nowiki>geo.gs</nowiki> (dead link 2018)
* [[Glow]]
* [[Pants]]
* [[Social Igniter]]
* [[Storytlr]] an open-source lifestreaming platform.

== Unmaintained ==
These projects appear to be unmaintained, but they're still open source so you may be able to find something to re-use or a starting point for a new project.

=== Hello, world. ===
An open-source tumblr/blog/rss reader/wordpress-like thingy.  Post your content easily and collect content from other rss/ostatus capable sites.  Also, lets you syndicate what you post onto other sites like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and grab their content as well (backwards-compatibility ;) Technical-wise: it uses the [https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/ Ostatus] stack, passes [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT0 SWAT0], BrowserID for authentication, written in Python but meant to run on shared servers.
* Code at [https://github.com/mimecuvalo/helloworld Github].

[[Nucleus CMS]] is an open source blogging platform. It allows maintaining multiple blogs and is quite extensible through its plugin system.

'''IndieWeb enthusiasts previously using it on their own site:'''
* {{gRegor}} used it on gregorlove.com from 2002 to 2015, then migrated to [[ProcessWire]]
** Contributed several plugins and core developments.
* Given the current [[Nucleus#Development|development]] status of Nucleus, I do not recommend using it.

=== Red Wind ===
{{main|Red Wind}}

'''[[Red Wind]]''' is IndieWebified blog software written in Python and running on Flask. It is intended to be clean, lightweight, and amenable to experimentation. Red Wind is open source and fairly new with minimal documentation.

== Unreachable ==
These projects appear to be offline, unreachable, or have broken permalinks which need fixing and should be considered for adding to [[site-deaths]].

* [[projects]]
* Brainstorm: improve documentation thereof to be particularly kind to [[creator]]s, especially to folks formerly active in the community, in the hopes that they feel welcome to rejoin at any time, and contribute at any level, not necessarily the way or form they did before, and in explicit consideration that [[life happens]].
