A '''<dfn>filter bubble</dfn>''' is a narrowed personal perspective caused by algorithmic filtering of the content in one's social feed and the feedback mechanisms which are part of those loops.

The neologism stems from Eli Pariser's book ''The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You'', Penguin Press (New York, May 2011) ISBN 978-1-59420-300-8
