'''<dfn>[http://feedafever.com Fever]</dfn>''' was a self-hosted, proprietary [[feed reader]] that is no longer developed or sold as of 2016-12-24 [https://shauninman.com/archive/2016/12/24/goodbye_mint_goodbye_fever]. It was a [[Google Reader]]-style feed reader written in [[PHP]]. It had a one-time fee of $30 and only worked on a single domain due to built-in DRM. It had some interesting "sparks and trends" features which de-duped articles in order to create a "fever" view of links that many articles link to.

* {{bret}} - I used to run fever until malformed feeds hosed the backend DB. It has a single developer, has a non-open source license, contains many bugs and never gets updated.  Do not recommend especially with all the other options these days.
