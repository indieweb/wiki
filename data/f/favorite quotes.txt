{{stub}}

'''<dfn>favorite quotes</dfn>''' is a feature on some personal sites (often a <dfn>footer quote</dfn> on a [[homepage]]) and some silo profiles (like Facebook), where people add quotes that resonate particularly strongly or are sufficiently self-describing as to be part of their self-description or bio.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In rough date order:
=== Kartik Prabhu ===
{{kartikprabhu}} has a favorite quote on his [[about]] page (since the page was created sometime in 2013) :
* https://www.kartikprabhu.com/about <blockquote>We are not nouns, we are verbs. I am not a thing…I am a person who does things…and I never know what I'm going to do next. I think you can be imprisoned if you think of yourself as a noun. — Stephen Fry</blockquote>

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has favorite quotes in the footer of his [[homepage]] since 2016-014:
* http://tantek.com/#favorite-quotes

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} has favourite quotes at https://jamesg.blog/quotes

=== vanderwal ===

{{vanderwal}} has a favorite quote in the footer of his homepage https://vanderwal.net (It was used in group message boards and was on a on of my pages prior).
<blockquote>"Those who cannot feel the littleness of great things in themselves are apt to overlook the greatness of little things in others." from The Book of Tea by Kakuzo Okakura </blockquote>

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] profiles have a "FAVORITE QUOTES" feature as the last item in the "Details About You" tab in your own profile, or "Details About ((given-name))" when viewing someone else's profile, and it can have its own access limits (like friends-only). E.g.
* https://www.facebook.com/tantek.celik/about?section=bio (shows "Favorite Quotes" to "[Facebook] friends only").
