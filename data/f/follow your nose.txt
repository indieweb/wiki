'''<dfn>follow your nose</dfn>''' is an intentional local & web-centric methodology for designing [[discovery algorithms]] that start with a specific URL that to discover things about, inspecting its contents, often for specific hyperlink [[rel]] values to predictably discover information about & resources for that URL, in contrast to the ”[[well-known]]” approach of instead checking outside that URL, like using only its domain with a hardcoded path.
