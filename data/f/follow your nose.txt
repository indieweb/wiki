'''<dfn>follow your nose</dfn>''' is an intentional local & web-centric methodology for designing [[discovery algorithms]] that start with a specific URL that to discover things about, inspecting its contents, often for specific hyperlink [[rel]] values to predictably discover information about & resources for that URL, in contrast to the ”[[well-known]]” approach of instead checking outside that URL, like using only its domain with a hardcoded path.

== Advantages ==
=== predictable portability ===
”Follow your nose” creates more predictable portability. 

When you move a document that is on one site to another, everything ”about” that document moves with it or is inside it where you can easily check, there’s no need to additionally check random ”other places” (whether at the root of the domain or somewhere else) for ”other things that need to move with it”.

* 2002 possible first use of concept/phrase: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Oct/0162.html (CW: [[Semantic Web]])
* Advantage: is anti-fragile, that is, when a document only depends on follow your nose discovery methods, you can fully inspect it for any and all dependencies, whereas in contrast, for anything that depends on any hardcoded domain-based paths (like well-known), you have no idea when you are ”done” moving something or what new dependencies may have accrued by new hardcoded paths.
* Advantage: can work even when documents are places without domains or root paths that the document owner can control, like local multi-user file systems, or alternative non-DNS systems like [[IPFS]], in contrast to [[well-known]] which makes assumptions about domains and root control.
