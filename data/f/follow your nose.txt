'''<dfn>follow your nose</dfn>''' is an intentional local & web-centric methodology for designing [[discovery algorithms]] that start with a specific URL that to discover things about, inspecting its contents, often for specific hyperlink [[rel]] values to predictably discover information about & resources for that URL, in contrast to the ”[[well-known]]” approach of instead checking outside that URL, like using only its domain with a hardcoded path.

== Advantages ==
=== predictable portability ===
”Follow your nose” creates more predictable portability. 

When you move a document that is on one site to another, everything ”about” that document moves with it or is inside it where you can easily check, there’s no need to additionally check random ”other places” (whether at the root of the domain or somewhere else) for ”other things that need to move with it”.
