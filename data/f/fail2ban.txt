'''<dfn>[https://fail2ban.org fail2ban]</dfn>''' is a utility that bans logins from IP addresses that show signs of malicious activity (like many failed login attempts).

Because the marking as banned is automatic, you should always ensure that your IP address is part of the [[allowlist]]- see http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Whitelist
