'''<dfn>[https://fail2ban.org fail2ban]</dfn>''' is a utility that bans logins from IP addresses that show signs of malicious activity (like many failed login attempts).

== How To ==
It appears the project is now using the GitHub wiki for documentation instead of the wiki on their own domain:
* https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/wiki

Because the marking as banned is automatic, you should always ensure that your IP address is part of the [[allowlist]]. TODO: review the wiki above to find the current link for this. <!-- see http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Whitelist -->
