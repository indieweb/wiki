'''<dfn>foo</dfn>''' is jargon that is sometimes used in computer language programming examples to express the name of a variable, usually with another variable “bar”, to illustrate a concept or algorithm; FOO is also an acronym for “Friends Of O'Reilly” typically seen in the phrase “Foo Camp”, the predecessor of [[BarCamp]], which the IndieWeb community uses as a model for [[IndieWebCamps]].
