'''<dfn>file transfer</dfn>''' is the practice of moving or copying files from one device to another, either between your own or to and from others, that some [[silos]] help facilitate, and some community members use other tools to do so, sometimes with their personal sites.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

None currently. If you use your personal site for file transfer for yourself or others:
* {{addyourself}}

== OS Examples ==
OS-specific examples often work locally, without any need for an internet connection.
*  [[Air Drop]] across [[iOS]], [[iPadOS]], [[MacOS]]
* Windows Link for Android + Windows
* ...

== Silo Examples ==
Silo file transfer examples typically require using intermediary storage owned by the silo, somewhere else on the internet.

* [[Dropbox]]
* [[Google Drive]]
* Apple [[iCloud]]
* Mega (?)
* [[messaging]] apps: You can direct message yourself on most messaging apps. Not directly on Discord, but as ribo.zone pointed out, you can create a group DM and not add anyone.
** [[Slack]] dm
** [[WhatsApp]] dm
