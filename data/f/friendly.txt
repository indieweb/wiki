'''<dfn>IndieWeb friendly</dfn>''' refers to online services interoperating by supporting open formats, protocols, and IndieWeb [[building-blocks]] as well as enabling users to transition to their own personal sites, and an implementation guide for social networks to interconnect with the IndieWeb.

== Why ==
If you're making a content hosting service (e.g. for blogging, photo posting, etc.), by being indieweb friendly, you can reduce the fear of lock-in, and encourage more folks to freely experiment.

By interoperating with existing IndieWeb formats and protocols, you instantly help your users interact with an existing live, vibrant, and friendly community.

Some developers have been able to more rapidly build platforms & services, and allow their users more flexibility & choice by relying on IndieWeb [[building-blocks]]. For example, by supporting the W3C recommended [[Micropub]] specification, platforms don't need to immediately design and build user interfaces for posting content as there are a variety of (both web and mobile) clients that can handle this on their behalf. Many of these are also open source to decrease the time for modifying and adapting them to other use cases.

== How ==
Follow these steps to make your service more IndieWeb friendly, and interoperate with indieweb sites:

=== Indieweb basics ===
Basic support for indieweb formats and protocols
# Provide a way for users to enter a personal website/blog, and then automatically link to it from their profile page with [[rel-me|rel=me]]. If your site supports OAuth, this is key to becoming an [[RelMeAuth]] provider for [[Web sign-in]].
# Markup users' feeds and post permalink pages with the [[h-entry]] microformat including a nested [[h-card]] for the authorship information. This permits others to easily provide rich [[reply-context]]s when replying to posts on your site.
# Markup users' profile pages with [[h-card]]
# Let the user automatically syndicate in [[posts]] (marked up using [[h-entry]]) from their personal site

=== Be a good POSSE destination ===
# Support [[WebSub]] notifications for receiving posts from their personal site
# Link permalinks back to users' original posts from syndicated copies on your service
# Use [[rel-canonical]] on links from syndicated copies on your service to original posts.
# Send [[webmentions]] to users' original posts from comments on their POSSE copies.

=== Support distributed interactions ===
# Support receiving [[webmention]]s + [[h-entry]] parsing to accept decentralized [[comments]] on posts.
# If your service supports subscription/following/friending/anything showing an aggregated timeline/feed/stream, allow users to subscribe to other peopleâ€™s personal site [[feeds]] marked up with [[h-feed]] and/or [[h-entry]]
# Support [[IndieAuth Ticket Auth]] so that users can safely provide [[private posts]] via feed subscriptions

=== Enable independence ===
# Let users link a domain name to their profile and content, treat that domain as canonical (e.g. like [[Tumblr]] and [[GitHub]] do)
# Provide a way for users to [[export]] all their user data (posts, comments, tags, likes/faves), and interactions on that data.
# Provide HTTP redirects if users want to change their domain name, or switch from a subdomain on your service to their own domain name

=== Tumblr ===
{{main|Tumblr#IndieWeb_Friendly}}

[[Tumblr]] has long had many IndieWeb or adjacent features, like [[RSS]] feeds, and in 2022 publicly committed to adding more IndieWeb building blocks support!

Posts about Tumblr adding IndieWeb support:

See the [[Tumblr#IndieWeb_Friendly|IndieWeb Friendly section on the Tumblr page]] for more details.

== Brainstorming ==
Ideally, someone building a service who wants the service to be IndieWeb-friendly should be able to come to this page and have a clear path of how to do so. In addition to a clear guide with examples of things like adding h-entry to posts, h-card to authors, etc, we should also provide links to tools that can validate or test the markup.

== Previously ==
Sites that had some IndieWeb friendliness but appear to have been shut down or experienced [[site-death]].
* <span id="Spreadly">[[Spreadly]]</span>
* <span id="App.net">[[App.net]]</span> supported several indieweb building blocks, outlined in Daltonâ€™s [http://web.archive.org/web/20170123035253/http://blog.app.net/2013/08/07/response-to-brennan-novak-part-ii/ response to Brennan Novak part 2].
