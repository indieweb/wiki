'''<dfn>IndieWeb friendly</dfn>''' refers to online services interoperating well with the indieweb by supporting open indieweb formats, protocols, as well as enabling users to transition to their own indieweb sites.

== Why ==
If you're making a content hosting service (e.g. for blogging, photo posting, etc.), by being indieweb friendly, you can reduce the fear of lock-in, and encourage more folks to freely experiment.

By interoperating with existing indieweb formats and protocols, you instantly help your users interact with an existing live, vibrant, and friendly community.

== How ==
To be indieweb friendly and interoperate with indieweb sites, start with doing the following:

=== Indieweb basics ===
Basic support for indieweb formats and protocols
# Provide a way for users to enter a personal website/blog, and then automatically link to it from their profile page with [[rel-me|rel=me]]. If your site supports OAuth, this is key to becoming an [[IndieAuth]] provider.
# Markup users' feeds and post permalink pages with the [[h-entry]] microformat including a nested [[h-card]] for the authorship information. This permits others to easily provide rich [[reply-context]]s when replying to posts on your site.
# Markup users' profile pages with [[h-card]]
# Let the user automatically syndicate in [[posts]] (marked up using [[h-entry]]) from their personal site
=== Be a good POSSE destination ===
# Support [[PuSH]] notifications for receiving posts from their personal site
# Link permalinks back to users' original posts from syndicated copies on your service
# Use [[rel-canonical]] on links from syndicated copies on your service to original posts.
# Send [[webmentions]] to users' original posts from comments on their POSSE copies.

=== Support distributed interactions ===
# Support receiving [[webmention]]s + [[h-entry]] parsing to accept decentralized [[comments]] on posts.
# If your service supports subscription/following/friending/anything showing an aggregated timeline/feed/stream, allow users to subscribe to other people’s personal site [[feeds]] marked up with [[h-feed]] and/or [[h-entry]]

=== Enable independence ===
# Let users link a domain name to their profile and content, treat that domain as canonical (e.g. like [[Tumblr]] and [[GitHub]] do)
# Provide a way for users to [[export]] all their user data (posts, comments, tags, likes/faves), and interactions on that data.
# Provide HTTP redirects if users want to change their domain name, or switch from a subdomain on your service to their own domain name

== Friendly Services ==
=== Huffduffer ===
[[Huffduffer]], built by [[User:Adactio.com]] is a tool for creating podcasts out of audio files from around the web. It supports several indieweb-friendly technologies that 
* Asks for your personal website on sign up and grabs rel=me links to build your user profile
* Huffduffer user profile is marked up with rel=me
* [[microformats2]] support for podcast feeds, including [[h-feed]] (actually hfeed) and [[h-entry]]
* https://huffduffer.com/add?page= ostensibly scrapes microformats data from the source page to fill in the title, permalink, and description.
=== Withknown ===
[[Withknown]], running hosted versions of [[Known]], is naturally very indieweb friendly and supports a huge amount of indieweb technologies.

(need specifics on all the above)

=== Brainstorming ===
Ideally, someone building a service who wants the service to be IndieWeb-friendly should be able to come to this page and have a clear path of how to do so. In addition to a clear guide with examples of things like adding h-entry to posts, h-card to authors, etc, we should also provide links to tools that can validate or test the markup.

=== Previously ===
Sites that had some IndieWeb friendliness but appear to have been shut down or experienced [[site-death]].
* [[Spreadly]]

==== App.net ====
[[App.net]] supports various indieweb building blocks, outlined in Dalton’s [http://blog.app.net/2013/08/07/response-to-brennan-novak-part-ii/ response to Brennan Novak part 2], including:
* [[PuSH]] support both as a publisher and (!) a subscriber, i.e. you can [[POSSE]] to App.net without writing a single line of code if you already publish an ATOM feed
* [[rel-me]] support for verified domains, enabling use as an [[indieauth]] provider
* [[microformats2]] support on feeds and post permalinks including [[h-card]] and [[h-entry]]
* displays a link to the canonical version of your own posts ([http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2854/9698340641_718f6d231d_o.png example])

== In Progress ==
Sites or tools that have in-progress (pending) work to make them more IndieWeb Friendly
=== Pandoc ===
There's a pull request to improve Pandoc templates to generate [[h-entry]]
* [https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/pull/200  Add minimal h-entry support for indieweb #200]
