Starting around 2017-08-25, Twitter introduced "Follow search" as a button and UI prompt to some users.

Screenshots:


==== Stay Informed prompt ====
When first shown to the user, a UI prompt is provided that explains the feature a bit and provides multiple "Follow search" buttons:


Hashtag follow search UI prompt - from https://twitter.com/hashtag/newbase60

==== Follow Search button ====
At some point the UI prompt no longer shows up on search results, leaving only the "Follow search" button near the top - from https://twitter.com/hashtag/indieweb?f=tweets&vertical=default

If you click the "Follow Search" button it is inverted and turns into a "Following search" button:

Hovering over the button turns it red and changes the text to "Unfollow search"


== Brainstorming ==
=== follow search webaction ===
In a system where different services perform posting, search, and reading services, "Follow Search" would make sense as a [[webaction]] that a [[search]] service could provide that the user's browser could delegate to their preferred [[reader]] service, perhaps on their own site.
