The Twitter icon links to [https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9C%20In%202000%2C%20a%20French%20government%20report%20noted%20that%20vineyards%20used%203%25%20of%20all%20agricultural%20land%2C%20but%2020%25%20of%20the%20total%20pesticides.%20In%202013%2C%20a%20study%20found%20traces%20of%20pesticides%20in%2090%25%20of%20wines%20available%20at%20French%20supermarkets.%E2%80%9D&url=https://gu.com/p/8tpdq/stw this long tweet intent URL], and the email icon links to [mailto:?subject=Has%20wine%20gone%20bad?&amp;body=%E2%80%9C%20In%202000,%20a%20French%20government%20report%20noted%20that%20vineyards%20used%203%25%20of%20all%20agricultural%20land,%20but%2020%25%20of%20the%20total%20pesticides.%20In%202013,%20a%20study%20found%20traces%20of%20pesticides%20in%2090%25%20of%20wines%20available%20at%20French%20supermarkets.%E2%80%9D%20https://gu.com/p/8tpdq/sbl this long email subject and body URL].

Both Twitter and email icons darken their backgrounds upon hover.
