'''<dfn>[https://github.com/kartikprabhu/fragmentioner fragmentioner]</dfn>''' is a Javascript utility by {{kartik}} which gives a pop-up link with the [[fragmention]] URL to a piece of selected text.

== UI ==

"Link to text" links to the [[fragmention]] of the selected text.

Clicking "Link to text" highlights the paragraph containing the selected text, and scrolls it to the top of window.

== Other UIs ==
Examples of other pop-up / overlay UIs when you select text on a page for the sake of sharing what was selected:

=== The Guardian ===
When you select text* in a The Guardian article, it shows two circular icons for Twitter and Email that you can use to share a link and (at least some of) the selected text:

From the 2018-05-15 article [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/15/has-wine-gone-bad-organic-biodynamic-natural-wine  Has wine gone bad?]

The Twitter icon links to [https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9C%20In%202000%2C%20a%20French%20government%20report%20noted%20that%20vineyards%20used%203%25%20of%20all%20agricultural%20land%2C%20but%2020%25%20of%20the%20total%20pesticides.%20In%202013%2C%20a%20study%20found%20traces%20of%20pesticides%20in%2090%25%20of%20wines%20available%20at%20French%20supermarkets.%E2%80%9D&url=https://gu.com/p/8tpdq/stw this long tweet intent URL], and the email icon links to [mailto:?subject=Has%20wine%20gone%20bad?&amp;body=%E2%80%9C%20In%202000,%20a%20French%20government%20report%20noted%20that%20vineyards%20used%203%25%20of%20all%20agricultural%20land,%20but%2020%25%20of%20the%20total%20pesticides.%20In%202013,%20a%20study%20found%20traces%20of%20pesticides%20in%2090%25%20of%20wines%20available%20at%20French%20supermarkets.%E2%80%9D%20https://gu.com/p/8tpdq/sbl this long email subject and body URL].

Both Twitter and email icons darken their backgrounds upon hover.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Except apparently if you triple-click select the headline, there is no UI. Likely a bug.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Copy instead of nav ===
{{t}} instead of "Link to Text", I want "Copy link to text" that copies the [[fragmention]] to the clipboard rather than navigates to it. Copying the link seems more like the default desired action more often than navigation, why would you want to navigate to the thing you just selected?
