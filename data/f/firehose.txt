=== Chris Aldrich ===

{{chrisaldrich}}'s [http://www.boffosocko.com homepage] has a [https://boffosocko.com/blog/ 'firehose' link], which links to a full feed of all of his posts.  He also has links to feeds of individual post types.

"I did this particularly as with increasing varieties of content and content types on my site, I don't expect that everyone will necessarily want the "firehose" feed, but may prefer to read subsections of content by post types, categories, or tags."
