    '''<dfn>frontmatter</dfn>''' is a common way to include metadata in plain text. Currently the most seen method is including YAML in front of Markdown content, but some document formats offer built-in support for front matter.

== Support ==

* most static generators support a variety of front matter; this is most commonly YAML, but some accept TOML or JSON.
* [[Github]] displays front matter in Markdown files in a table: [https://github.com/spf13/hugo/blob/master/examples/blog/content/post/hello-hugo.md Hugo example]

== Examples ==

=== [http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#X18 asciidoc] ===

asciidoc has a built-in support for metadata. While this metadata is usually minimal, it is OK to extend it with custom variables. It does not seem to support structured data, making it's use a little limited, but since it's part of the format, it's not as alien as the more common methods.

Hugo supports YAML, TOML, and JSON, but they need to be separated by different separators. This is a YAML example.

=== [https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties Obsidian] ===

Obsidian calls its frontmatter "properties". These can be written in YAML or JSON format, and can be used as a key-value store for page metadata that can be referenced by custom plugins. This includes tags.

While an unlimited number of any arbitrary metadata names and values can be added, Obsidian contains special support for the following default defined properties:

<pre>
---
tags:
  - tag one
  - tag two
aliases:
  - Alternate page name one
  - Alternate page name two
cssclass: class-name-to-apply-to-text
---
</pre>

This metadata can be searched in Obsidian. For example, a search for <code>[status:Deprecated]</code> will return all pages where the frontmatter property <code>status</code> has been set to <code>Deprecated</code>.

Pelican is not following the usual method: it does not have the common separators.

== Criticism ==

=== No common set of basic variables === 

None of the current static generators share the same keywords or syntax for even the most common variables, such as author, tags, publish date; with the exception of "title", though the case might vary here as well. (Title vs title ) - 2016-08-19 [[petermolnar]]


=== Most parsers are not aware of it === 

Since it's an alien format inside another format (YAML in Markdown most commonly ), therefore regular Markdown parsers are unaware of it and thus it will not be parsed accordingly. [[pandoc]] is an exception. - 2016-08-19 [[petermolnar]]
