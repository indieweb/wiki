'''<dfn>Food</dfn>''' is a post type that represents eating or drinking particular food or drink. Its content is often similar to a [[note]] or can be easily represented as plain text. 

== Why ==
Why post food and drink that you consume? Perhaps as a way of tracking your own consumption.

Why post food and drink consumed in public posts? Perhaps as a way of holding yourself publicly accountable to what you eat and drink.

{{rhiaro}}: I post these publicly so when people ask 'what do vegans eat' I can send them a URL.

Posting your food consumption is a way of creating visual art. Sharing what you eat lets the world see a bit more into your life: what is it that fuels you every day? What is it that you rely on to get you through the day? Do you drink coffee? Or do you prefer tea? Does fruit help you stay awake?

Posting food and drink is also a good way to share your eating principles with others. If someone asks "what food do you like," you will have a record to which you can point them. May not be that helpful but it's certainly a conversation starter.

== How ==
No specific markup has been suggested for this aside from the usual [[h-entry]] for [[posts]].

=== Related food list examples ===
Related to food posts, but not quite posts themselves, a few folks keep lists of foods/drinks that they've consumed or [[want]] to consume, sometimes with annotations about whether they liked them or not.

==== Ryan Barrett ====
{{snarfed}} keeps lists of beer, whiskey, and wine he's had and would like to try:
* https://snarfed.org/beer
* https://snarfed.org/whiskey
* https://snarfed.org/wine

== Brainstorming ==
=== Presentation ===
Possible components of presentation (via {{aaronpk}} description of [[p3k]])
;icon
:somewhat represents the food or drink in broad categories
;text
:user entered, describes the food or drink

Possible enhancements:
;photo
:of the item consumed
;recipe
:link that describes in more detail how the item was made
;location
:the place where a food or drink was consumed (i.e. a cafe, a restaurant). Could be referenced by name (i.e. The IndieWeb Cafe) or as a general category.
;price
:the price of a food or drink

=== Offline ===
I started tracking my food posts by writing in a text file on my phone. Now when I am somewhere without cell service, I continue to use the text file for offline food posts, and then post them after I get back to a network connection. - {{aaronpk}}

=== Foodspotting ===
See [[Foodspotting]].
=== Untappd ===
* [[Untappd]] - specifically for beer [[drink]]s consumed.

== FAQ ==
=== Are drinks really food ===
Q: Are drinks really a kind of food? A subset of food? Or a kind of food?

A: Yes. The presence of phrases such as "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_diet liquid diet]", and acceptance by at least some that a smoothie, e.g. as prepared by vendors like Jamba Juice, is an acceptable meal, seems to lend credence to considering drinks as a form of food.

=== Optimal ways to track food ===

Q: What is the best way to track food consumption?

=== Tracking food without silos ===

Q: There are apps that let you track your food, like the Fitbit app. Are there open-sourced alternatives / non-silo alternatives that make it easy to track food?
