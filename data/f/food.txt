'''<dfn>Food</dfn>''' is a post type that represents eating or drinking particular food or drink. Its content is often similar to a [[note]] or can be easily represented as plain text. 

== Why ==
Why post food and drink that you consume? Perhaps as a way of tracking your own consumption.

Why post food and drink consumed in public posts? Perhaps as a way of holding yourself publicly accountable to what you eat and drink.

{{rhiaro}}: I post these publicly so when people ask 'what do vegans eat' I can send them a URL.

== How ==
No specific markup has been suggested for this aside from the usual [[h-entry]] for [[posts]].

== Brainstorming ==
=== Presentation ===
Possible components of presentation (via {{aaronpk}} description of [[p3k]])
;icon
:somewhat represents the food or drink in broad categories
;text
:user entered, describes the food or drink

Possible enhancements:
;photo
:of the item consumed
;recipe
:link that describes in more detail how the item was made

=== Offline ===
I started tracking my food posts by writing in a text file on my phone. Now when I am somewhere without cell service, I continue to use the text file for offline food posts, and then post them after I get back to a network connection. - {{aaronpk}}

=== Foodspotting ===
See [[Foodspotting]].
=== Untapped ===
* [[Untappd]] - specifically for beer [[drink]]s consumed.

== FAQ ==
=== Are drinks really food ===
Q: Are drinks really a kind of food? A subset of food? Or a kind of food?

A: Yes. The presence of phrases such as "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_diet liquid diet]", and acceptance by at least some that a smoothie, e.g. as prepared by vendors like Jamba Juice, is an acceptable meal, seems to lend credence to considering drinks as a form of food.
