Notes archived from https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-06-09#t1465497302181

* we started with the simplest tool we could get to work. the domain name.
* with individual websites how can we help people own their own data
* then we moved onto social media
* so we post events on our own website
* I happen to be running this on WordPress
* KevinMarks comes along, and posts an RSVP on his own website
* happens to be running Known
* important part is that he is saying he is going to this event
* and points to the event web page
* uses small building blocks
* key parts here p-rsvp
* yes I am going to this event
* and the in-reply-to - links to the event
* then he needs to notify me
* uses key building block Webmention
* uses a POST
* source is the RSVP, target is the event
* my site receives that, goes and gets the source, verifies the RSVP
* he RSVPs to the event, between two websites, no intermediary
* we feel strongly about meeting people where they already are
* largely that's in the silos
* you can see people hae retweeted it
* commented on google+
* grid of building blocks
* some stats
* if you have a personal website you likely already have microformats and don't know it
* keep tackling the huge problems
* we're right there with you
* at the same time, try thinking small, try thinking incremental, and meet people where they are

=== Q&A: ===
Q: are microformats are something you guys designed and invented? or found? what thoughts are into JSON vs HTML?
* A: microformats existed before IndieWebCamp
* we chose HTML because it is there
* milliions billions of websites
* and with microformats
* we want to meet people where they are

Q: could you explain relationship between IndieWebCamp technologies and W3C Social Web Working Group? 
* A: we are fortunate that key IWC players are in the SWWG
* these core building blocks are open standards
* Webmention, Micropub are working their way through these standards bodies
