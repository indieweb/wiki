=== Portland P2P Section ===
Brief list of topics OH in the discussion section:

=== SF P2P Section ===
Brief list of topics OH in the discussion section. (We expect there's plenty of prior art for most of these.)

* protecting your domain from hijacking
* "indie mobile." self-published personal or small group mobile apps, often sideloaded instead of distributed through an app store
* animating SVG dynamically on a web site
* POSSE for semi-public, private, one-to-one (e.g. [[messaging]]), and single-user (e.g. health) data
** we'd like to see more examples of automated private and semi-public POSSE in the wild
* private indieweb posts: users have to login/auth somehow. what's the least auth you can get away with? one-time login, e.g. with a cookie that doesn't expire, is pretty little. could you do zero auth by checking that referrer is POSSEd post? or by sniffing silo credentials?
* link-less (and [[permashortcitation]]-less) [[original post discovery]]. if you already know the person's domain, you can fetch the front page, parse it, and search [[rel-syndication]] links for the POSSE post URL. use case: avoid annoying silo users but still support [[backfeed]], etc.
** you can even try to do this without rel-syndication links by fuzzy matching on timestamps and text in original posts.
* lots of people POSSE/PESOS *within* silos: they may think of one account as their "primary," cross-post to others for wider reach, and include links back to the primary silo posts. interesting opportunity for research and maybe shortcut for outreach and explaining ideas.
* Android/iOS app ideas: want indieweb friendly mobile publishing/sharing apps similar to existing indie reply browser extensions and bookmarklets?
** micropub client that supports a number of intents, so it's easy to send text, URLs, images, etc. to it?
** similar client that sends web intents/actions instead of micropub?
** looked at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.snarfed.android.openinapp Open Link In App] ([https://github.com/snarfed/open-in-app GitHub]) as a jumping-off point.
* indie reader: one of the biggest differences from traditional feed readers is replying to/interacting with a post. can you decouple the reader from your site and still get that? ideas:
** register your site's web intent/action endpoints with reader, its reply (etc) UIs point there.
** reader renders each post as iframe to original post. reply browser extension operate on "current" iframe.
** reader extracts and includes mf2 in each post, including fully qualified URLs. reply browser extension operates on that.
