=== What ===
<div class="p-description description">
[[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] hosted a demo, talk and open conversation about the indieweb for newcomers to the movement:

''When you post to sites like Twitter and Facebook, who owns your data? Do you have full control? Does your profile serve your needs, or theirs?''

''IndieWeb publishers post content to their own sites first, and are creating an independent social web that will change the way people post online. Learn about the people and technologies at the forefront of this movement, and how you can build a personal website that you truly own.''
