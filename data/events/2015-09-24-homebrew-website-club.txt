'''Homebrew Website Club Meetup''': Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? A Twitter replacement all for yourself? If so, come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends that want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project... At Edinburgh we mostly quietly hack, but there are always people happy to tell you about and get you started with indieweb protocols if you're new!
