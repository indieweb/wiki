== Notes ==
We talked about:
* origins of blogs
* contrasting old school of blogging (i.e. when attendee Peter Merholz coined the term "blog" which was what Ev used to name [[Blogger]])
* how to [[POSSE]] an [[event]], where to POSSE events to (e.g. [[Eventbrite]], [[Facebook]], [[Plancast]], [[Google+]]). 
** General agreement that Eventbrite would a logical destination
*** especially with the [[rel-syndication]] link to "RSVP on Eventbrite" (instead of "View on Twitter").
*** [[Eventbrite]] has a good API, for posting, for retrieving RSVPs (and thus [[backfeed]]ing them onto the original event post)
*** We have indieweb friendlies on the inside ([[Lanyrd]] folks) who may even help with more indieweb [[friendly]] implementation, adding [[microformats2]]/[[h-event]] and maybe even [[webmention]] support.
* most (5 out of 8) of those attending the breakfast RSVPd from their own site!
