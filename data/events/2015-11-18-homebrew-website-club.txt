17:30-18:30 '''Quiet writing hour''' before the meetup. Come on by to blog or do other writing quietly.

'''Homebrew Website Club Meetup''': Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy? If so, come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends that want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project... 

See the [http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter Homebrew Website Club Newsletter Volume 1 Issue 1] for a description of the first meeting.
