=== What ===
<div class="p-description description">
Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy? If so, come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends that want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project... 

See the [http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter Homebrew Website Club Newsletter Volume 1 Issue 1] for a description of the first meeting.

Summary of recent indieweb related happenings over the past two weeks:
* First ever [[2014/NYC|IndieWebCamp NYC]] was a big success!
* "The Once and Future IndieWeb" closing keynote at Web Directions Code conference in Melbourne, Australia.
* IndieWeb community takes [[IIW]] by storm!
** Lots of "indieweb" affiliation mentions as people went around the room
** Solid IndieWeb "track" of four sequential sessions
** Best notes of any sessions at IIW, also best remote participation via Talky.io and [https://etherpad.mozilla.org/iiw Etherpad].
** See: [[events/2014-05-06-iiw]] for more including links to IndieWeb session notes
* On the sad side: [[LiveJournal]] apparently "purges" inactive accounts after a 15 day inactivity warning!
* Return of [[Upcoming]]! http://upcoming.org/
* IndieWebCamp [[2014]] - now with simultaneous West and East locations thanks to the New York Times stepping up to host East!
** [[2014/Guest_List|RSVP now!]]
