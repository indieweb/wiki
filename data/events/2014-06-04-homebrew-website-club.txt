'''San Francisco'''
* Ben: Known now supports MySQL and Mongo, meaning you can run it anywhere you can run Wordpress
* [[User:Snarfed.org|Ryan]]: new [[Bridgy]] features. [https://snarfed.org/2014-05-13_webmentions-for-blogger-tumblr-and-wordpress-com Webmention support for Blogger, Tumblr, WordPress.com], stats on the [http://brid.gy/ front page], and [https://www.brid.gy/about#omit-link publish without original post link] (use [[rel-syndication]] instead).

Discussion with others about data portability for end users (primarily data formats) vs. for application developers (primarily APIs), and about HTML5 mobile webapp frameworks.

'''Portland'''

* Aaron:
** Fixed a bunch of IndieAuth bugs!
** Thinking about [[micropub#Updating_Objects|updating posts]] using Micropub. Most often I need to add a syndication URL to a post, or add a tag, since I post far more short notes and photos than I do long articles.
* Paul: adding h-entry to his website
