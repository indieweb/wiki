== Notes ==
We talked about:
* how to [[POSSE]] an [[event]], where to POSSE events to (e.g. [[Eventbrite]], [[Facebook]], [[Plancast]], [[Google+]]).
* does it make sense POSSE [[RSVPs]] to such event POSSE destination? (general feeling was no, ok to just let the primary indieweb event page aggregate all the RSVPs, and have it be canonical in terms of who is going, number of people going etc.)
* most (4 out of 6) of those attending RSVPd from their own site!
