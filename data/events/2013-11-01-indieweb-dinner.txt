== Notes ==

Notes from conversations over dinner.

=== text file sync across personal devices ===
Why don't we already have simple text file syncing across our personal devices, peer-to-peer over a local network rather than having to sync to "the [[cloud]]" and then sync back down?
* business incentives for cloud services

What would it take to build peer-to-peer text file syncing, e.g. via one of the devices acting as a WebDAV server (server app exists for Android, but apparently not iOS)?

Maybe QRCodes used for in-person social network connecting (e.g. Path UI with QRCode + camera on each person's device - either can photo the others QRCode and have the connection be established) can be used to establish device-to-device credentials to then use over an open network to establish subsequent connections, eg using public keys.
