Notes from conversations over dinner.

=== Realtime mention notifications ===
One of the thing I like about Twitter is getting push notifications when people mention my name. This should be possible on our own indieweb sites as well. Here is a possible outline of how that could happen. [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaronparecki.com]] 12:13, 1 October 2013 (PDT)

==== Publishing ====
* Create a "mentions" feed of [[h-entry]]s (containing an h-cite), like http://waterpigs.co.uk/mentions
* Publish that feed to a [[PuSH]] hub (or run your own hub)
* When your site receives a [[webmention]], add it to your /mentions feed and send an update to the PuSH hub

==== Subscribing ====
* Get a mobile app like [[Prowl]] or use SMS
** or write your own!
* Set up a PuSH subscriber that can send you a notification through the app
** if you write your own app, your PuSH subscriber can communicate directly to the phone's push notification service and avoid using a 3rd party service like prowl.
* Subscribe to your mentions feed using the PuSH hub

Now, whenever you receive a webmention, your site pings the hub, the hub notifies the subscriber which sends you a push notification! This type of system is great because it's built on [[building blocks]] so each piece ends up being swappable, and you can choose how much of the infrastructure you want to run on your own.

=== Realtime inline display of comments ===

As of today, Facebook is the only [[silo]] that has realtime [[comments-display|display of comments]] on a [[post]]. When you're looking at a post on Facebook and someone adds a comment, it shows up automatically with no page refresh.

Given the real-time nature of [[webmention]], it should be possible without too much difficulty to replicate this experience on our own indieweb sites. When viewers are looking at a post, a webmention received by the server could be broadcast to anybody currently viewing that post.
