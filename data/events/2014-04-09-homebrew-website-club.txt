'''Chicago'''

Kartik and gRegor attended. Since this was the first meeting for Chicago, we did not have much of an agenda. We briefly discussed where we're at with our webmention support, techniques for original post discovery without backlinks [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/125], DATETIME vs TIMESTAMP fields in MySQL, and various microformats.

A brief overview:

* Kartik is working on mf2py and better parsing/display of webmentions.
* Kartik is working on storing mentions in HTML files.
* gRegor is working on a stream of mentions.
* gRegor is parsing replies and mentions currently, but adding support for likes, reposts, etc.
* When storing date-time values in MySQL, gRegor recommends using TIMESTAMP fields instead of DATETIME
** The format is the same, but the former converts from the session's TZ to UTC when storing
** Similarly, when querying a TIMESTAMP field, the value is converted back to the session's TZ
** The session TZ can easily be set before querying, allowing reliable TZ conversion.
** DATETIME fields are TZ agnostic

Intelligentsia Coffee worked well as a meeting location. Not too busy or noisy. It should work well for meetings of up to 3-4 people. Beyond that, we'd probably be better off finding a different space.


'''San Francisco'''

Informal discussion notes:

* [[User:kylewm.com|Kylewm]] and [[User:iboxifoo.com|iboxifoo]] discussed indieweb possibilities for a knowledgeable website designer without a programming background. Goal is to post tweets to own site and have them POSSEd to twitter automatically, without Wordpress or Bridgy Publish.
** cited http://chloeweil.com/blog/hipster as motivation/goal wherein she describes a simple text entry form that saves text to a database and APIs it to twitter. Not a full CMS by any means.
** iboxifoo has Publify running locally but has had major difficulty getting Rails deployed on a server.
** Where to go from here?
