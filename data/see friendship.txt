'''<dfn>See Friendship</dfn>''' is a (currently [[silo]]-only) feature that shows a timeline of [[posts]] (like [[note]]s, [[photo]]s, [[event]]s) that are in common between two people, so far only implemented in [[Facebook]].

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
On user profile pages, when logged in, [[Facebook]] provides a "See Friendship" option (like in a menu option from the "..." button/menu over the header image) that shows a "See Friendship" page, e.g.:
* https://www.facebook.com/tantek.celik?and=aaronpk
* https://www.facebook.com/aaronpk?and=tantek.celik
This appears to be commutative as both URLs show the same result.

== Similar IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no IndieWeb Examples of the "See Friendship" feature yet, however, there is at least one implementation of a similar feature.
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} on his site aaronparecki.com has a "links-to" feature that shows a timeline of all posts where he has linked to a particular domain/person, since 2014-10-13. E.g.:
* http://aaronparecki.com/links-to/tantek.com
