'''<dfn>[http://jekmentions.alhur.es/ Jekmentions]</dfn>''' was a service that works as webmention endpoint and saves the received webmentions in a GitHub repository (shut down in [https://github.com/fiatjaf/jekmentions/issues/4#issuecomment-172675169 01-2016]). 

== Sites that use Jekmentions ==
* [[User:fiatjaf.alhur.es|Giovanni]] on [http://fiatjaf.alhur.es fiatjaf.alhur.es]
* [[User:kirilind.me|Kirilind]] on [http://labs.ouishare.net labs.ouishare.net] (as of 2015-05-10)

== Features ==

<strong>Jekmentions</strong> works only with Jekyll sites hosted on GitHub pages, but, differently from Javascript-based webmention endpoints designed for static sites like [[webmention.io]] and [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com], Jekmentions doesn't require Javascript and doesn't store the contents of the received webmentions.

Instead, whenever Jekmentions receives a webmention, it pushes it to the GitHub repository which is hosting the Jekyll site, which then uses some magic to render that webmention in the correct page or post it belongs.

== How to use ==

Jekmentions will save one file for each webmention received, all them inside the <pre>_webmentions</pre> directory on the root of the repository, and then under the path corresponding to the actual path of the page targeted:

Knowing that path and file structure, and reading about [http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/ Jekyll collections], the feature that makes this possible, you can use your imagination and implement a layout that renders the webmentions at their correct page.
