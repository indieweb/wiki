== How to ==

=== How to add events to the newsletter ===
The newsletter gets the list of upcoming and past events from the [[events]] page. Make sure the event has a name, url, and start date, and that those are marked up with microformats2 classes. You can [http://pin13.net/mf2/?url=http%3A%2F%2Findiewebcamp.com%2FEvents test the page in a parser] to make sure the parser finds these fields.

For each upcoming and past event that will be included, it will fetch the event URL and look for photos on the page. If there is a microformats2 "photo" property, that will be used first, and if none is found, the "featured" photo will be used if present.

If there is a summary on the event permalink, it will also be included.

=== How to add blog posts to the newsletter ===
You can add any post to the newsletter by submitting it to [[IndieNews]]! You can submit your own posts by adding a u-syndication URL, or you can submit other people's posts by bookmarking them on your site. Full details are available here: http://news.indiewebcamp.com/how-to-submit-a-post

== When ==

This week's post is generated on Fridays at 13:30 Pacific Time, and announced in IRC for previewing. At 13:50, the final post is generated, and at 14:00, Mailchimp generates the email from the post on the server, and sends it to all email subscribers, and it is tweeted out from @indiewebcamp.

== Ideas ==

Other things you'd like to see in the weekly summary:

* list pages that have received webmentions this week (in descending order of # of mentions)
* commits to relevant source code repositories (github.com/indieweb, or possibly from a list of source repositories on the wiki)
* new blog posts from community members with p-category=indieweb
* use [[Census]] to retrieve h-cards for domains to use their icon and name instead of domain name, e.g.: from/to:
** Events 14 edits by tantek.com and aaronparecki.com
** Events 14 edits by {{t}} and {{aaronpk}}
