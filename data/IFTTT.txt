'''<dfn>[https://ifttt.com/ IFTTT]</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for IF This Then That, and is a [[spof]] for performing (semi?)-automated actions using [[feeds]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members using IFTTT:
=== Jeremy Keith ===
{{adactio}} uses IFTTT to [[POSSE]] his blog [[posts]] from adactio.com to [[Facebook]]. [https://ifttt.com/recipes/search?q=feed+facebook Example recipes for this (and more).]

== Issues ==
=== Non-trivial latency ===
IFTTT has a non-trivial latency due to being limited to the once every 15 minutes polling they do.

=== No custom request headers ===
IFTTT HTTP requests to other sites have no way of being configured to send custom request headers.

== Criticism ==
=== SPOF ===
Because IFTTT is fairly popular (perhaps the most popular such service on the web) and in use by numerous sites large and small, it is particularly big [[SPOF]] (single point of failure). The lack of open source implementation (which you could move to if it existed by deploying your own) also adds to the fragility that you introduce when you depend on IFTTT.
