'''<dfn>[https://www.readability.com/ Readability]</dfn>''' was a [[bookmarking]] and reading related service that shut down 2016-09-30. [https://medium.com/@readability/1641cc18e02b#.5w7zs5dgy] 

It was also an API service that took any web article and returned only the relevant content — headline, author, body text, relevant images and more — free from any clutter. Upon shutdown this API service was taken over by [[Mercury]] tools.
