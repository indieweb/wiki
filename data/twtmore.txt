    '''<dfn>twtmore</dfn>''' was a service (twtmore.com) from 2009-2015 for posting notes to [[Twitter]] over 140 characters by auto-truncating the tweet with a tm.to permalink to the full note, all of which are now dead links that redirect to the home page. 

== Goodbye ==
Message that all tm.to links now redirect to at the tm.to/index.html homepage:

<blockquote style="padding:2em;background:#0f0f0f;color:#8b9462">
<div style="font-size:30px;text-align:center">We’ve flown away.</div>

It’s been a wonderful ride. We made twtmore in 2009 to solve the problems with the complete
garbage of 'tweet-over-140-characters' services at the time. Since then, we’ve seen over
60 million tweets go through twtmore from all around the world. Regardless, tweeting has changed,
and we’ve grown up. To our third party developers, our users, our friends: thanks for using twtmore,
we're absolutely humbled by your support over the years. See you around.
