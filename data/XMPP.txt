'''Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (<dfn>XMPP</dfn>)''' is an open [[messaging]] standard, perhaps best known in its use for cross-platform instant-messaging application interoperability.

The core part of XMPP is now an IETF RFC, RFC-6120 http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/rfcs/

Up until recently the XMPP world and the Web world rarely crossed, but now thanks to work on https://github.com/legastero/stanza.io and https://github.com/xmpp-ftw/xmpp-ftw you can now "talk" XMPP directly from the web.

== Issues ==
General issues: 
* massive spec
* no one has ever fully implemented it
* there's no comprehensive (or even feature covering) test suite
* everyone who tries to implement it, only ever implements a subset of it
* interop requires testing with every implementation you want to interoperate with (instead of just with a standard test suite)
