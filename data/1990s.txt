Following the [[1980s]] and preceding the [[2000s]].

The '''<dfn>1990s</dfn>''' was a decade that saw the invention and growth of the web, dominated by independent websites, as well as nascent [[silos]] like [[Geocities]], with a particular brightly colored and often translucent design aesthetic that would come to define the era along with under construction graphics, dancing animals, site counters, ornate backgrounds, and guest books.

== Why ==
Aesthetics from the 1990s, especially on websites, are a popular form of nostalgia that harken back to when the web was much quirkier, weirder, and more diverse, across a plethora of independent sites exploring a new medium without strict rules or expectations.
