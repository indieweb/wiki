'''<dfn>[https://orkut.com/ Orkut]</dfn>''' was a [[silo]] from Google that existed from 2004 to 2014 (see [[site-deaths]]) and was very popular in Brazil and India.

== Scrapbook ==

Orkut's ''Scrapbook'' was a [[messaging]] service of Orkut that allowed public small ''scraps'' (a text message) to be posted by anyone to anyone's account.

Orkut's Scrapbook, although simple, was a somewhat unique messaging service for a social network. It worked as a hybrid between [[private messaging]] and publicly posting, for example, on a friend's Facebook Timeline. But, unlike private messaging, unlike posting to a friend's Timeline and unlike sharing content with everybody and at the same time with no one (as with Twitter), in the Scrapbook:

* the content was public;
* the content was directed to someone;
* the posted content wasn't mixed with totally unrelated contents (in a Twitter or Facebook stream, for example);
* the posted content wasn't perishable;
* the posted content wasn't streamed to anywhere, so ''it wasn't a big deal'' to send someone a scrap, it would not be shown to a lot of unrelated people, except if they went looking after it;

These apparently simple features:

* encouraged quick message exchanges, regarding any subject, big or small, even between strangers;
* allowed people to include themselves in others' conversations, if the theme interested them and they happened to see it;
* encouraged public discussion of themes that, at first, could be seen as unworthy, because they were not being displayed at everyone's computers, they were shown just to the interested people.
