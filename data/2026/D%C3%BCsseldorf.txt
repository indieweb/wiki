{{emojicon|💻}}
<!-- * Main IndieWebCamp room: [https://events.indieweb.org/2025/05/indiewebcamp-d%C3%BCsseldorf-lbBv9MGOChq2 Zoom in the IndieWeb Event!] -->

* {{addyourself}}

== Health and Safety ==
The venue has plenty of space to sit distanced, and windows which we can and will open to provide fresh airflow.

If you are feeling sick or experiencing any respiratory (Covid, RSV, flu, cold) symptoms, we require that you please participate remotely instead of in-person.
{{emojicon|😷}}
Masking 😷 recommended (but not required) both in-person inside the venue, and in transit (airports, flights, trains) to the venue.

Plan to bring N95 (or equivalent) respirator or KN95 (or equivalent like FFP2) masks to wear.

Neither the venue nor the subsequent Beyond Tellerrand conference has any explicit health and safety rules, however we are recommending masking to help mitigate risks, both for IndieWebCamp participants, and for those we may interact with at Beyond Tellerrand.

'''Updates:''' similar to the [[2025/Düsseldorf|IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2025]] Health and Safety policy, this policy is a living policy, and may receive clarifying edits between now and the IndieWebCamp. However, we will not remove or downgrade any aspect of this policy between now and IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2026.
