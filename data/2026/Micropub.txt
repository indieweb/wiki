== Proposed Issues on the Micropub Spec to Discuss ==

https://github.com/indieweb/Micropub/issues

* https://github.com/indieweb/Micropub/issues/12 - The actual spec does not discuss how extensions may become part of the spec, if they should, and process for extensions could use some refining in general.
* Several extensions could be absorbed into the spec, most specifically
** https://github.com/indieweb/Micropub/issues/13 - Standardizing some query returns using established extensions

=== Main Micropub Extension Lists ===
* https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues
* https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions

* The process for stable extensions becoming official does not need to be part of the spec
* there are a short list of relatively-stable extensions that should be moved into the main spec

=== Reviewing Stable Extensions ===
* mp-slug:
** [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Micropub-extensions&oldid=103179#Slug Wiki permalink]
** Resolution: Agreement to add to spec
* post status
** [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Micropub-extensions&oldid=103179#Post_Status Wiki permalink]
** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/19 GitHub Issue]
** Resolution: Agreement to add to the spec
** Do not close off the option for other statuses
* Visibility
** [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Micropub-extensions&oldid=103179#Visibility Wiki permalink]
** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/11 GitHub Issue]
** The definition of how to implement "private" or "unlisted" is left up to the server
** Options could be displayed in a different language
** Wordpress has a "sticky" checkbox but that is out of scope
** Resolution: Agreement to add to the spec
* Query for supported vocabulary
** [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Micropub-extensions&oldid=103179#Query_for_Supported_Vocabulary Wiki permalink]
** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/1 GitHub Issue]
** What should happen when a post type is not supported by a client (ignored?)
** There are lots of additional discussions around this feature
*** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/8 Supported properties]
*** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/33 Supported properties on post types]
** The spec references the post type discovery types
** Someone may want to add additional post types but clients would not be be expected to show unsupported types
** Post type discovery can/should continue to evolve (e.g. watch types)
** Resolution: Agreement to add to the spec
* Query for post list
** [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Micropub-extensions&oldid=103179#Query_for_Post_List Wiki permalink]
** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/4 GitHub issue]
** Resolution: Too few implementations: (micro.blog not present to confirm, Indiepass for Android has been deprecated)
* Tag List
** Returning all tags might be too much
** Could add auto-complete string matching with a filter
** Resolution: Too few implementations but lots of interest in experimentation (quill, omnibear)
* Limit parameter
** [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Micropub-extensions&oldid=103179#Limit_Parameter Wiki permalink]
** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/35 GitHub issue]
** Quill only uses this from the media endpoint
** Benji uses on media endpoint on server/client
** As defined it is too generic
** Doesn't make sense for some queries (e.g. post-types)
** Resolution: Due to ambiguity, this should be moved out of stable, consider focusing only on media endpoint
* Destination
** [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Micropub-extensions&oldid=103179#Destination Wiki permalink]
** [https://github.com/indieweb/micropub-extensions/issues/3 GitHub Issue]
** Different from syndication (also sharing to Twitter)
** Aaron uses this to share to different websites than his main site
** Resolution: Too niche. Move out of stable
* Media endpoint extensions
** Lots of discussion history but nothing stable

=== Standardization of Extensions ===
* We say "the core Micropub spec isn't expected to change" but should that change?
* The config query is core but can be extended
* mp-slug is a suggestion for the server
* {{aciccarello}} doesn't support private post to post visibility but knows that when using a client
* For users who don't control client/server there could be confusion if client indicates a feature not actually supported
* Could add a way for clients to negotiate if a feature is supported
* All clients should be expected to implement the whole spec
* Extensions are optional
* Stable extension definition should be amended to require projects are actively developed
* Features like querying contacts or location should probably never be in the core spec
* Missing understanding of if clients support current stable extension (e.g. post-status)
* To be brought into core, it should have interoperability
* Do extensions need to be stable for a certain amount of time before being made official
* ITEF has 3 annual meetings for discussion, but those aren't where they are standardized
* Decisions can be made async
* This meeting is more like a working group
* Other organizations usually have more organized leadership (e.g. a chair to determine concensus)
* Who can make the judgement call
* MCP group has "sponsors" of extensions to represent it
* Could have a shepherd/sponsor for micropub extensions who are responsible for pushing things forward
* To standardize as official, get a minimum number of people (implementors?) on a call
* Shepherd/sponsor is responsible for scheduling
* There could be a long time to get things standardized, but that is acceptable
* Should define what group of people is authorized (implementors & spec involvement)
* David will continue gardening
* W3C Social Web Working Group is spinning up again, could try to standardize there
