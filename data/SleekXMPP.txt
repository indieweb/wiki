'''<dfn>SleekXMPP</dfn>''' is an open source (MIT licensed) [[XMPP]] library for [[Python]] 2.6/3.1+ that you can use to build clients that can run on your own web server.

The goal of SleekXMPP is to provide a modular Python based set of tools to enable client and server XMPP programming. All XMPP features are implemented as plugins as part of this goal.

SleekXMPP is featured in examples in <cite>XMPP: The Definitive Guide</cite> by Kevin Smith, Remko Tron√ßon, and Peter Saint-Andre. If you've arrived here from reading the Definitive Guide, please see the notes on updating the examples to the latest version of SleekXMPP.
