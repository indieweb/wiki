{{stub}}

'''<dfn>data portability</dfn>''' is the ability for the user of a device, service, or site to move their data (anything they author or incidentally create like location tracking) to another device, service, or site (like their indie web site) of their choosing, preferably in an open standard format.

== Silo Examples ==
Below is a list of sites that meet the following criteria:

# they let you publish things on the web
# they let you retrieve '''all''' the content that you have posted in a reasonably user friendly way (with third party tools, if necessary)

(Note: being able to backup your data from these services means you can transition to running your own site. [[posse]] is a better way as the canonical version remains on your site and syndicate to the other services.)
