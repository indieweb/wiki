'''<dfn>File Storage</dfn>''' is the practice of storing main (primary) site content in flat files in a filesystem.

== Why ==
Many indieweb [[projects]] are storing their data in flat files on the file system for reasons of simplicity and robustness.  

See also the [[databases-antipattern]] for reasons why flat files for storage are growing in popularity compared to databases.

== How ==
These flat files typically are either:
* [[Markdown]] with custom (per project) extensions for various metadata
* HTML+[[microformats]] (e.g. [[hAtom]] and/or [[h-entry]])

And contain either:
* one post per flat file
* time sharded: a set of posts per fixed time period per flat file

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members that use file storage on their personal site.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} on tantek.com uses flat files for primary storage of content:
* [http://tantek.com/2010/001/t1/declaring-independence-building-it 2010-01-01]... present: [[Falcon]] which stores data in HTML+microformats flat files, 6 per year (1 per [[bim]]).  See [[Falcon#Storage_format|Falcon storage format]] for details.
* [http://tantek.com/log/2002/08.html 2002-08]...[http://tantek.com/log/2008/08.html 2008-08] static site directly served from primary storage of flat files, up to 12 per year (1 per Gregorian month).

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} on [http://aaronparecki.com aaronparecki.com] uses [[p3k]] - one file per post, YAML extensions for meta info - since ~2011.

=== Kevin Marks ===
{{kevinmarks}} on [http://kevinmarks.com kevinmarks.com] stores posts formatted as HTML in [https://github.com/kevinmarks/kevin-marks.com GitHub] and deploys statically to Heroku.

=== Bear ===
[[User:Bear.im|Bear]] at https://bear.im/ uses [[Hakkan]] uses flat files for storage of all content:
* posts - since 2003-12-18 stored as text with some textual/markdown/whatever markup, with one file per post, named year+day-of-year, key:value header for metadata and a json blob for connected resources
* webmentions - stored as html in the same directory as the post
* comments - stored as html in the same directory as the post
* feeds and related

=== Bret C. ===
{{bret}} uses the following on bret.io:
* Stores site content in git
* Renders to html using [[jekyll]]/gh-pages
Yaml headers (aka front-matter) with [[GitHub]] flavored [[Markdown]] mixed with liquid template include tags for post attachment metadata.  Yuuuuuck!  This is what jekyll sets you up with.  It has its ups and downs, but its a mix of 3 weird languages which really bothers me.

=== Rascul ===
{{rascul}} stores content for https://rascul.io in a [https://git.rascul.io/crash/content git repository] and uses [[crash]].

=== Barnaby Walters ===
Stores all canonical copies of [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] site data in the filesystem and uses [[Taproot]] for publishing.

* notes and articles as YAML files with HTML in (wants to change these to HTML+mf2 for browsability, standards support)
* timestamped HTML archives (along with HTTP headers in *-headers.txt) in URL-mimicking folder structures
* Sheet music in ABC files

=== Mark87 ===
Testing at [http://markmurfin.com/editor.php Editor] and [http://markmurfin.com/viewer.php Viewer]
* Simple, working Editor saves simple articles as html files to the filesystem.
* Viewer system loads the html files and can output them with different markup, css, adding h-data, etc.
* Wants to save html files with microdata schema for super cool idea that I have

=== Emma K. ===
[[User:notenoughneon.com|Emma]] at http://notenoughneon.com using [[Neonblog]]. Posts are stored in html+mf2 files. The feed is dynamically generated from parsed microformats with an index persisted in JSON.

=== ... add yourself ... ===

=== ... many more [[Jekyll]] users ===

=== Want to use file storage ===
IndieWeb members that *want* to use File Storage on their personal site:
* [[UserKartikprabhu.com|Kartik]] using [[Bundle]] wants to move away from [[MySQL]] to a HTML+mf2 based file storage for main content. Has played with YAML-based storage but does not like it. Article content is authored and stored in Django-style HTML templates anyway.
* add yourself.

== Other Independent Examples ==
=== David Baron ===
David Baron on http://dbaron.org/ uses flat HTML files, one per blog post, one for his blog index page, since 2002.

== Intranet Examples ==
=== XOXCO ===
XOXCO uses flat [[markdown]] files as the storage for their internal wiki which they use and contribute to from [[Slack]]

** http://aaronparecki.com/bookmarks/2015/05/21/3/wiki-slack-database

== Flat file "CMS" systems in the wild ==

* [http://www.getgrav.org/ Grav] is a PHP, YAML, Twig and Markdown Extra based storage project which looks promising.
* [http://getkirby.com/ Kirby] is another.

== Criticism ==
=== Command Line Configuration ===
The process of uploading and setting up flat file storage on shared [[hosting]] may require command line configuration such as:
* <kbd>chmod -R 0777</kbd>[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-10-16/line/1413497857282]
Any flat file storage solution should seek to minimize and eliminate any command line based configuration needs.
