<div style="padding:2em; background:yellow">
'''THIS PAGE IS OUT OF DATE''' and horribly incomplete. It hasn't been touched in any significant way since 2013-06-28.

For any particular feature / [[building-block]], see the "IndieWeb Examples" list on the wiki page for that feature.

For any particular [[project]], see that projects own page for its list of what's supported.

For an overview of what IndieWeb features you should implement in what order, see:
* [[IndieMark]]

</div>

== Why out of date and incomplete ==
Why is this page out of date and horribly incomplete?
* It's too hard to maintain (so no one bothers to)
* Tables don't work well with the site CSS - this page is already clipping (at least) one column in the table.
* Tables are not responsive (in the "responsive design" sense)

Instead, every time you implement a new [[IndieMark]] feature/level on your site:
* add your self/project/site to the '''IndieWeb Examples''' section on that feature's wiki page 
* add the feature to your project's page on the wiki

== Support Table ==
This table really ought to be somewhat ordered by the features described in [[IndieMark]].
