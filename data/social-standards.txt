'''<dfn>social standards</dfn>''' refers to web standards that have a social component, that is, for people (e.g. [[h-card]]), relationships between people (e.g. [[XFN]]), content published by people meant to be read (e.g. [[h-entry]]) &amp; replied to such (e.g. [[rel-in-reply-to]]), and notifications thereof (e.g. [[webmention]]).

== People ==
Mark up instances and references to people using the [[h-card]] microformat.
=== Identity ===
In addition, mark up a person's personal web site URL and hyperlink with [[rel-me]] as a step towards [[Web sign-in]]/[[IndieAuth]] support.

== Relationships ==
Markup links to people from pages about other people using [[XFN]] rel values.

== Content ==
Markup content written by people using [[h-entry]], including marking up the author with <code>p-author</code> and [[h-card]].

== Replies ==
[[Replies]] should themselves also be marked up with [[h-entry]], and hyperlink to with [[rel-in-reply-to]] to the original post that is being replied to.

== Notifications ==
When publishing a reply, implementations should also send a [[webmention]] to the original post.
