'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-author rel-author]</dfn>''' is a microformat for linking a post to the URL representing its author.

'''Q:''' What is the meaning of the combination of <code>rel="author"</code> with <code>class="p-author h-card"</code> as a one-line authorship inside an h-entry?

Example:
<pre><a href="../" class="p-author h-card author-icon" rel="author" title="Tantek Çelik"><img src="../logo.jpg" alt="Tantek Çelik"></a></pre>

It's not clear to me why <code>rel="author"</code> is used in this instance, but not in other, more verbose, h-card instances. Is the implication of the combination, "The h-card is found at this URL" instead of "This is the h-card"? So far I have interpreted the <code>class="p-author h-card"</code> to mean "This is the h-card." {{gRegor}}

'''A:''' <code>rel="author"</code> is for legacy parsers that only support rel-author + rel-me for determining authorship, and don't support h-card yet (e.g. Google spiders). It is easy enough to add the rel-author to one-line h-cards.

In more verbose h-cards, using rel-author would add complexity and the cost of that complexity is likely worse than ignoring legacy parsers. It's a trade-off, but the recommendation to not use rel-author with more complex h-cards.
