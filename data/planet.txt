A '''<dfn>planet</dfn>''', in the context of the indieweb, and blogs/feeds for even longer, is a site that aggregates feeds/updates from a variety of sources, typically focused on a particular topic or community.

== Why ==
Similar to a [[public timeline]], a planet provides an easy way to get an overview or introduction to a topic or community.

== How ==
One way to build an indieweb-style planet is to use a [[reader]] that allows public access to view the page. This can be done using [[dobrado]], where an account is required to manage the subscription list but the page containing the feed list can be made public.

== Examples ==
Example "planets":
* http://planet.mozilla.org/
** {{t}}â€™s [[article]] posts are aggregated into this planet
* https://www.drupal.org/planet
** Aggregates a tag from each included blog
* https://unicyclic.com/indieweb
** Subscribes to all feeds found from members of the community
* ...

== Brainstorming ==
There have been various brainstorming discussions about planets, in particular, about the potential of building an IndieWebCamp Planet site, based on signups on this page:
