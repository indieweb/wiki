[https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl Pushl] is a command-line tool for generating periodic push notifications (such as [[WebSub]], [[Webmention]], and [[Pingback]]) from sites which do not provide push themselves.

It was written as a companion to [[Publ CMS]] but it will work with most site generators, including static generators. It works best with sites which provide an [[RSS]] or [[Atom]] feed, which also includes many forums such as [[phpBB]].

The intention is for it to run as a cron job, but it can also be run manually or via a Git publishing hook or the like.
