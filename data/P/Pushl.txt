'''<dfn>[https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl Pushl]</dfn>''' is a command-line tool for generating periodic push notifications (such as [[WebSub]], [[Webmention]], and [[Pingback]]) from sites which do not provide push themselves.

It was written as a companion to [[Publ CMS|Publ]] but it will work with most site generators, including static generators. It works best with sites which provide a subscription feed ([[RSS]], [[Atom]], [[h-feed]], etc.), which also includes many forums such as [[phpBB]].

The intention is for it to run from a cron job, but it can also be run manually or via a Git commit hook or the like.
