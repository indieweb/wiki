'''Perl''' is a general-purpose programming language, first developed in the 1980s by Larry Wall. It had its heyday in the 1990s as a popular choice for writing CGI-based software in the earliest days of the Web. While [[Python]] has largely supplanted it in terms of popularity within its functional domain, Perl remains an actively developed technology with a very large install base as well as a vast collection of community-contributed modules known as [https://metacpan.org CPAN].

In 2000, Larry Wall shifted his focus to Perl version 6; this work has since been renamed to [https://raku.org Raku], and recognized as a separate "sister language" to Perl. With Larry's focus elsewhere, Perl's ongoing development is today overseen by an open committee known as [https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/ Perl 5 Porters], and the language known for years as "Perl 5" is now simply "Perl".

Perl's homepage is https://www.perl.org/. The language's ongoing development is supported financially by [https://perlfoundation.org The Perl Foundation], a nonprofit organization.

** "I use 2500 lines of Perl that I wrote in a 20-hour-a-day spasm in the fall of 2002.  Iâ€™d probably pay the digital equivalent of GotJunk dot com to haul it away if there were a good alternative." [https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ @timbray] March 1, 2019
