'''Welcome to the planning page for future IndieWebCamps!'''

The IndieWebCamp community is <dfn>planning</dfn> numerous upcoming [[events]], including future [[IndieWebCamps]], regular [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups, talks, and other proposals — if you'd like to help, please contribute to this page.

See each individual IndieWebCamp's home page (typically /Year/City ) for planning specific to that camp.

Want to learn what it takes to plan and organize an IndieWebCamp? See:
* '''[[IndieWebCamp Organizing]]'''

== Planned ==
Tickets are open! Go register!

'''[https://events.indieweb.org/tag/indiewebcamp Upcoming IndieWebCamps]'''

== Save Dates ==
The following IndieWebCamps have a confirmed date and venue, start planning travel!
* ...

=== One Preferred Or Workable Date ===
The following IndieWebCamp(s) being planned have only one preferred or workable date, as proposed. Save the dates in your calendar. We cannot confirm these dates at this time though, so wait on booking any travel!
* ...

== Planning ==
The following IndieWebCamps are currently being planned and need help figuring out a date - help co-organize!

Clustered first by co-organizers that are regularly active in the community (e.g. in [[IRC]]), and then ordered roughly by known date if any, then expected/likely dates (in order to see what else there may be planned nearby or elsewhere)

=== 2020 ===
Let's plan more 2020 IndieWebCamps!

If you live in one of the cities / states / countries below and are interested, add your name!

If you know of a suitable venue for hosting, add that as a possibility.

If you have a particular month of the year to recommend, add that!

Please offer your opinion/preference with a nested list item and +1/0/-1 signed!

General planning date notes:
* December is tough due to holidays and lots of other events. Exception: a one day IWC e.g. [[2015/SF]].
* November first half is the likely last chance to plan an IWC for the year.

Sorted roughly by how "real" a particular potential IWC is looking for a city based on a few fuzzy criteria:
* likely/confirmed co-organizers (2+ required, at least one that is active in IRC/Slack, preferably at least 1 experienced successful organizer, preferably 3-4 total)
* likely/confirmed venue
* likely/confirmed dates

==== Pop-ups ====
{{main|2020/Pop-ups}}
IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2020 are stand alone single topic sessions started in 2020, partly in response to the coronavirus pandemic that has prevented the long history of regularly occurring in-person camps in various cities.

While not designed to be the traditional two day camps of sessions and creating, they are meant to foster ongoing discussion and development of topics of interest to the IndieWeb community.

If you're interested in hosting one, feel free to go to [[2020/Pop-up/Sessions|Session Proposals/Brainstorming]] page and begin to flesh out your event, or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org IndieWeb chat].

Catering sponsored by TerminusDB
* Pastries and fruits in the morning; and vegetarian lunch (with some dishes vegan-friendly) on the 2nd day

Keynote: Something about JSON-LD and micro formatting (TBC)

* <add other suggestions>

Tasks/ things to figure out:

* AV system at the venue for remote participants - onsite Live screaming and recording provided

* ''Ticketing system (most probably using Eventbrite), types of tickets - free tickets on sale now (done)''

* ''Stickers, pronoun batches, stickies and stationaries - do we get them from IndieWeb org? (done)''

* Stationary for the day: markers, labels, additional informative stickers;

* List of lunch recommendations for first day;

* Find a place for the social bit in the evening (ideally a place that does food too);

== Help Out ==
Want to help out with one of those? Say something in [[IRC]] and add yourself to the page.

{{gwg}} is willing to help out with an Indiewebcamp, providing support and planning to the extent possible. This would include some volunteering. Depends on what is needed and when and is willing to try to work with anyone who needs help in the Northeastern United States, and possibly farther afield if sufficient notice.

== Organize ==
Want to organize a 2019 [[IndieWebCamp]] in your town and don't see it above?

Start with:
# Find at least one committed co-organizer. This is the most important step.
# Add a link above to <nowiki>[[2019/YourCity]]</nowiki>
# Click it and create the new page, and continue with the steps listed in:

Start a [[Homebrew Website Club]] chapter in your city to gather interested individuals and gauge interest in a full weekend IndieWebCamp!

=== FAQ ===
==== Creator camp not a hackathon ====
Q: Is IndieWebCamp a hackathon?

A: IndieWebCamps are creator camps focused on helping everyone develop, grow, and advance their personal indieweb presence.

The term "hackathon" has become to mean some sort of short term event where a group of people come up with a typically new project to develop just for the sake of the hackathon, often in a competitive environment, and often for prizes donated by one or more sponsors.

IndieWebCamp resembles that only in the aspect of group collaboration.
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on and improve your existing personal site, not just a new site (unless you need a new site!)
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on your personal site in a way that encourages [[longevity]] and your personal use beyond the camp itself.
* IndieWebCamp focuses on collaboration instead of competition. There are all sorts of different experts at IndieWebCamp and we do our best to both ask questions of each other and help each other!
* The prize(s) you win at IndieWebCamp are your own improved personal website, hopefully with new features you can then use day-to-day after the camp has completed!

As we do "hack" on stuff (our own websites), IndieWebCamps do have a "hack day" component of it, but certainly not "hackathon" in the commonly understood "corporate hackathon" sense.

== Past Planning Notes ==
Past planning notes can be found on each event's planning page, e.g. 
* [[2018/Planning#Archived_Planning]].

To archive planning notes from this page:

# Add the event to [[IndieWebCamps]] if it isn't there already
# Add the event sub-page "Planning" if it doesn't exist yet, e.g. [[2017/Planning]]
# Add a section <code><nowiki>== Initial Planning ==</nowiki></code> to the event's Planning page
# Add a note in the new section "This is an archive of the initial planning for [event name], originally found here."
# Link the text "originally found here" to the latest, specific revision of this page where the notes last appeared.
# Copy/paste the latest planning notes from this page
# Remove the now-archived planning notes from this page.
