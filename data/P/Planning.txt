'''Welcome to the planning page for future IndieWebCamps!'''

The IndieWebCamp community is <dfn>planning</dfn> numerous upcoming [[events]], including future [[IndieWebCamps]], regular [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups, [[Popups]], talks, and other proposals — if you'd like to help, please contribute to this page.

See individual IndieWebCamp home pages (typically /Year/City ) for specific camp planning. Related:
* '''[[IndieWebCamp Organizing]]''' to learn what it takes to plan and organize an IndieWebCamp?
* '''[[2021/Pop-ups|2021 Pop-ups]]''' to see or propose more Popup sessions for 2021

== Planned ==
Tickets are open! Go register!

'''[https://events.indieweb.org/tag/indiewebcamp Upcoming IndieWebCamps]'''

== Save Dates ==
The following IndieWebCamps have a confirmed date and venue, start planning travel!
* ...

=== One Preferred Or Workable Date ===
The following IndieWebCamp(s) being planned have only one preferred or workable date, as proposed. Save the dates in your calendar. We cannot confirm these dates at this time though, so wait on booking any travel!
* ...

== Planning ==
The following IndieWebCamps are currently being planned and need help figuring out a date - help co-organize!

Clustered first by interest level and co-organizers that are regularly active in the community (e.g. in [[IRC]]), and then ordered roughly by known date if any, then expected/likely dates (in order to see what else there may be planned nearby or elsewhere)

=== 2021 ===
==== Pop-ups ====
{{main|2021/Pop-ups}}
IndieWebCamp Pop-ups 2021 are stand alone single topic sessions started in 2020, partly in response to the Coronavirus pandemic that has interrupted our long history of regularly occurring in-person camps in various cities.

While not designed to be the traditional two day camps of sessions and creating, they are meant to foster ongoing discussion and development of topics of interest to the IndieWeb community.

If you're interested in hosting one, feel free to go to [[2021/Pop-ups/Sessions|Session Proposals/Brainstorming]] page and begin to flesh out your event, or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org IndieWeb chat].

=== 2022 ===
Let's plan 2022 IndieWebCamps!

For now let’s continue planning online IndieWebCamps, perhaps focused on particular timezones.

Hopefully some areas can organize local in-person IndieWebCamps in 2022 as folks are vaccinated, regional cases are eliminated, by area / city. Keeping that in mind:

If you live in one of the cities / states / countries below and are interested, add your name!

If you know of a suitable venue for hosting, add that as a possibility.

If you have a particular month of the year to recommend, add that!

Please offer your opinion/preference with a nested list item and +1/0/-1 signed!

General planning date notes:
* December is tough due to holidays and lots of other events. Exception: a one day IWC e.g. [[2015/SF]].
* November first half is the likely last chance to plan an IWC for the year.

Sorted roughly by how "real" a particular potential IWC is looking for a city based on a few fuzzy criteria:
* likely/confirmed co-organizers (2+ required, at least one that is active in IRC/Slack, preferably at least 1 experienced successful organizer, preferably 3-4 total)
* likely/confirmed venue
* likely/confirmed dates

==== Summit ====
Planning dates and venue for IndieWebSummit [[2022]] in Portland!

'''11th IndieWebSummit!'''
Venue possibilities

== Organize ==
Want to organize a 2019 [[IndieWebCamp]] in your town and don't see it above?

Start with:
# Find at least one committed co-organizer. This is the most important step.

=== FAQ ===
==== Creator camp not a hackathon ====
Q: Is IndieWebCamp a hackathon?

A: IndieWebCamps are creator camps focused on helping everyone develop, grow, and advance their personal indieweb presence.

The term "hackathon" has become to mean some sort of short term event where a group of people come up with a typically new project to develop just for the sake of the hackathon, often in a competitive environment, and often for prizes donated by one or more sponsors.

IndieWebCamp resembles that only in the aspect of group collaboration.
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on and improve your existing personal site, not just a new site (unless you need a new site!)
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on your personal site in a way that encourages [[longevity]] and your personal use beyond the camp itself.
* IndieWebCamp focuses on collaboration instead of competition. There are all sorts of different experts at IndieWebCamp and we do our best to both ask questions of each other and help each other!
* The prize(s) you win at IndieWebCamp are your own improved personal website, hopefully with new features you can then use day-to-day after the camp has completed!

As we do "hack" on stuff (our own websites), IndieWebCamps do have a "hack day" component of it, but certainly not "hackathon" in the commonly understood "corporate hackathon" sense.

# Add a note in the new section "This is an archive of the initial planning for [event name], originally found here."
