'''Welcome to the planning page for future IndieWebCamps!'''

The IndieWebCamp community is <dfn>planning</dfn> numerous upcoming [[events]], including future [[IndieWebCamps]], regular [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups, [[Popups]], talks, and other proposals — if you'd like to help, please contribute to this page.

See individual IndieWebCamp home pages (typically /Year/City ) for specific camp planning. Related:

== Save Dates ==
The following IndieWebCamps have a confirmed date and venue, start planning travel!
* 2023-10-28…29 [[2023/Nuremberg]] the Saturday & Sunday immediately after the two day [[border-none|border:none]] conference.
* ...

=== One Preferred Or Workable Date ===
The following IndieWebCamp(s) being planned have only one preferred or workable date, as proposed. Save the dates in your calendar. We cannot confirm these dates at this time though, so wait on booking any travel!
* ...

== Planning ==
The following IndieWebCamps are currently being planned and need help figuring out a date - help co-organize!

Clustered first by likelihood, including interest level and co-organizers that are regularly active in the community (e.g. in [[IRC]]), and then ordered roughly by known date if any, then expected/likely dates (in order to see what else there may be planned nearby or elsewhere)

=== 2023 ===
Let's plan 2023 IndieWebCamps!

We had a few in-person IndieWebCamps in 2021-2022, notably in [[Germany]], so let’s continue planning those, and we should try to plan an in-person IndieWeb Summit [[2023]], keeping in mind vaccinations, and regional Covid case rates.

Let’s also continue planning online IndieWebCamps and <span id="Pop-ups">[[2023/Pop-ups|single topic pop-ups]]</span>, perhaps focused on particular timezones.
* If you're interested in hosting an online camp or pop-up, go to [[2023/Pop-ups/Sessions|Pop-up Session Proposals/Brainstorming]] page and write a stub for your event, or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org IndieWeb chat].

Locking in dates as far in advance as possible helps encourage the most attendance, especially farther away from venues/cities.

General planning date notes:
* December is tough due to holidays and lots of other events. Exception: a one day IndieWebCamp e.g. [[2015/SF]].
* November first half is the likely last chance to plan an IndieWebCamp for the year.

Nearby 2023 Events:
To keep in mind while planning
* 2023-01-01 New Year's Day

Keeping that in mind:

If you live in one of the cities / states / countries below and are interested, add your name!

If you know of a suitable venue for hosting, add that as a possibility.

If you have a particular month of the year to recommend, add that!

Please offer your opinion/preference with a nested list item and +1/0/-1 signed!

The following are listed in order roughly by how "real" a particular potential IndieWebCamp is looking for a city based on a few fuzzy criteria:
* likely/confirmed co-organizers (2+ required, at least one that is active in IRC/Slack, preferably at least 1 experienced successful organizer, preferably 3-4 total)
* likely/confirmed venue
* likely/confirmed dates
* candidate dates (adjacent to an existing event folks would go to)

'''11th IndieWebSummit!'''
Venue possibilities ([[Portland]] or another [[city]])

=== Restart a Recent City ===
The following [[cities]] / venues hosted IndieWebCamps in the recent past (since 2018), however showed little or no activity in 2022 and thus are parked here until someone steps up to organize them.

If you would like to co-organize an IndieWebCamp in one of the following cities / venues, speak up in [[discuss#meta|our #indieweb-meta chat channel]] and see if you can find a co-organizer! If you can, we’ll help with the wikifying, and move your city/venue to the 2023 section.

* {{aaronpk}} would love to attend, tho probably can only if it's adjacent to a conference i'm speaking at
* {{addyourself}}

Maybe align with a different event? [http://malmofestivalen.se/ Malmöfestivalen] / [https://theconference.se The Conference] / [https://oredev.org Øredev]?

Needs interested participants and possible dates! Would also be helpful with some additional core contributors attending, to ensure enough content at event.

Would be great to set a date 4-6 months in advance, to ensure time to plan a proper event.

== Help Out ==
Want to help out with one of those? Say something in [[IRC]] and add yourself to the page.

{{gwg}} is willing to help out with an Indiewebcamp, providing support and planning to the extent possible. This would include some volunteering. Depends on what is needed and when and is willing to try to work with anyone who needs help in the Northeastern United States, and possibly farther afield if sufficient notice.

== Organize ==
=== Organize a camp ===
Want to organize an [[IndieWebCamp]] in your town and don't see it above? 

Learn how to do that here: '''[[IndieWebCamp Organizing]]'''.

=== Organize a club meetup ===
Having trouble finding a co-organizer for your city or unsure how to organize an IndieWebCamp by yourself? 

Start a [[Homebrew Website Club]] chapter with a meetup in your city to gather interested individuals and gauge interest in a full weekend IndieWebCamp!

=== FAQ ===
==== Creator camp not a hackathon ====
Q: Is IndieWebCamp a hackathon?

A: IndieWebCamps are creator camps focused on helping everyone develop, grow, and advance their personal indieweb presence.

The term "hackathon" has become to mean some sort of short term event where a group of people come up with a typically new project to develop just for the sake of the hackathon, often in a competitive environment, and often for prizes donated by one or more sponsors.

IndieWebCamp resembles that only in the aspect of group collaboration.
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on and improve your existing personal site, not just a new site (unless you need a new site!)
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on your personal site in a way that encourages [[longevity]] and your personal use beyond the camp itself.
* IndieWebCamp focuses on collaboration instead of competition. There are all sorts of different experts at IndieWebCamp and we do our best to both ask questions of each other and help each other!
* The prize(s) you win at IndieWebCamp are your own improved personal website, hopefully with new features you can then use day-to-day after the camp has completed!

As we do "hack" on stuff (our own websites), IndieWebCamps do have a "hack day" component of it, but certainly not "hackathon" in the commonly understood "corporate hackathon" sense.

== Past Planning Notes ==
Past planning notes can be found on each event's planning page, e.g. 
* [[2018/Planning#Archived_Planning]].

To archive planning notes from this page:

# Add the event to [[IndieWebCamps]] if it isn't there already
# Add the event sub-page "Planning" if it doesn't exist yet, e.g. [[2017/Planning]]
# Add a section <code><nowiki>== Initial Planning ==</nowiki></code> to the event's Planning page
# Add a note in the new section "This is an archive of the initial planning for [event name], originally found here."
# Link the text "originally found here" to the latest, specific revision of this page where the notes last appeared.
# Copy/paste the latest planning notes from this page
# Remove the now-archived planning notes from this page.
