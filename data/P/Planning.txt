'''Welcome to the planning page for future IndieWebCamps!'''

The IndieWebCamp community is <dfn>planning</dfn> numerous upcoming [[events]], including future [[IndieWebCamps]], regular [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups, [[Popups]], talks, and other proposals — if you'd like to help, please contribute to this page.

== 2025 ==
Let's plan 2025 IndieWebCamps!

The IndieWebCamps in following subsections are currently being planned and need help figuring out a date - help co-organize!

We had a few in-person IndieWebCamps in 2021-2024, most of them [[Germany]] and one in [[San Diego]], so let’s continue planning those, and we should try to plan an in-person IndieWeb Summit [[2025]], keeping in mind vaccinations, and regional Covid case rates. See [[IndieWebCamp_Organizing#COVID_precautions|IndieWebCamp Organizing: COVID precautions]] for more.

Let’s also continue planning online IndieWebCamps and <span id="Pop-ups">[[pop-up|single topic pop-ups]]</span>, perhaps focused on particular timezones.
* If you're interested in hosting an online camp or pop-up, go to [[pop-up#Planning|Pop-up Planning]] page and write a stub for your event, or ask for help in the [https://chat.indieweb.org IndieWeb chat].

Locking in dates as far in advance as possible helps encourage the most attendance, especially farther away from venues/cities.

General planning date notes:
* [[November]] first half is the likely last chance to plan an IndieWebCamp for the year.
* [[December]] is tough due to holidays and lots of other events
** Exceptions: first or second weekend are possible like: [[2015/SF]], [[2019/SF]], [[2023/SD]] & [[2024/SD]].

=== Summit ===
{{emojicon|⛰️}}
'''10th IndieWebSummit!'''

Planning dates and venue for an <span id="Summit">IndieWebSummit</span> [[2025]], contingent on how many organizers can commit to making it happen, and our collective volunteer labor bandwidth to organize a full IndieWebSummit (which comes with higher expectations).

Venue possibilities maybe move to [[Seattle]] this year, or another [[city]] like [[NYC]]). Previously: [[Portland]]
* ... nothing specific yet that we know of

Organizers:
* {{t}} — for a Summit
* {{addyourself}} if you have experience organizing at least one prior IndieWebCamp, otherwise volunteer!

Volunteers:
* {{gwg}}
* {{martymcguire}}
* {{addyourself}}

==== Summit date proposals ====
Dates — Opinions from 2024:
* {{t}} — I’m up for flexible Summit scheduling (delaying a few months, like possibly as late as October if that means we can do it in-person)
* {{gwg}} - Concur with {{t}} that it doesn't have to be in the summer necessarily. Also, we could try a split event as we've done in the past.
* {{capjamesg}} - Keep me in the loop and I may attend!
* {{lifeofpablo}}
* {{tracydurnell}} - I like the idea of summer or fall when some activities can be outside!
* {{aciccarello}} - Planning to visit family in Washington in the summer. Would love to come to a summit if possible.
* {{benwerd}} - I would attend a fall summit just about anywhere. Also getting serious about a camp in NYC; could merge the two if it makes sense.
* {{addyourself}}

Specific dates:

Vague dates:
* 2025-?? some Saturday & Sunday
** {{addyourself}}

Perennial considerations:
* Adjacent events (avoid conflicts) 
** Pride weekend ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride#Spread last Saturday of June]) in several cities "last weekend of June to cap off the month and to coincide with the anniversary of the Stonewall riots" [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2019-07-01/1562016477939100 per fluffy]. Likely Seattle and San Francisco (extrapolating from past years)

== Restart a Recent City ==
The following [[cities]] / venues hosted IndieWebCamps in the recent past (since 2018) or have seen recent interest by organizers, and thus are parked here until someone steps up to organize them. 

If you would like to co-organize an IndieWebCamp in one of the following cities / venues, speak up in [[discuss#meta|our #indieweb-meta chat channel]] and see if you can find a co-organizer! If you can, we’ll help with the wikifying, and move your city/venue to the 2023 section.

Notes from prior years planning attempts left in-place (or in HTML comments) in case that helps future planning.

Cities without any active organizers remaining in chat (like for the past year) should be moved to [[#Past_Cities|Past Cities]].

== Help Out ==
Want to help out with one of those? Say something in [[IRC]] and add yourself to the page.

{{gwg}} is willing to help out with an [[IndieWebCamp]], providing support and planning to the extent possible. This would include some volunteering. Depends on what is needed and when and is willing to try to work with anyone who needs help in the Northeastern United States, and possibly farther afield if sufficient notice.

== Organize ==
=== Organize a camp ===
Want to organize an [[IndieWebCamp]] in your town and don't see it above? 

Learn how to do that here: '''[[IndieWebCamp Organizing]]'''.

=== Organize a club meetup ===
Having trouble finding a co-organizer for your city or unsure how to organize an IndieWebCamp by yourself? 

Start a [[Homebrew Website Club]] chapter with a meetup in your city to gather interested individuals and gauge interest in a full weekend IndieWebCamp!

== FAQ ==
=== Creator camp not a hackathon ===
Q: Is IndieWebCamp a hackathon?

A: IndieWebCamps are creator camps focused on helping everyone develop, grow, and advance their personal indieweb presence.

The term "hackathon" has become to mean some sort of short term event where a group of people come up with a typically new project to develop just for the sake of the hackathon, often in a competitive environment, and often for prizes donated by one or more sponsors.

IndieWebCamp resembles that only in the aspect of group collaboration.
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on and improve your existing personal site, not just a new site (unless you need a new site!)
* IndieWebCamp encourages you to work on your personal site in a way that encourages [[longevity]] and your personal use beyond the camp itself.
* IndieWebCamp focuses on collaboration instead of competition. There are all sorts of different experts at IndieWebCamp and we do our best to both ask questions of each other and help each other!
* The prize(s) you win at IndieWebCamp are your own improved personal website, hopefully with new features you can then use day-to-day after the camp has completed!

As we do "hack" on stuff (our own websites), IndieWebCamps do have a "hack day" component of it, but certainly not "hackathon" in the commonly understood "corporate hackathon" sense.

== Past Planning Notes ==
Past planning notes can be found on each event's planning page, e.g. 
* [[2023/Nuremberg/Planning#Archived_Planning]] — for a specific IndieWebCamp
* [[2018/Planning#Archived_Planning]] — for a specific IndieWeb Summit

To archive planning notes from this page:

# Add the event to [[IndieWebCamps]] if it isn't there already
# Add the event sub-page "Planning" if it doesn't exist yet, e.g. [[2017/Planning]]
# Add a section <code><nowiki>== Initial Planning ==</nowiki></code> to the event's Planning page
# Add a note in the new section "This is an archive of the initial planning for [event name], originally found here."
# Link the text "originally found here" to the latest, to an absolute URL of the specific revision of this page where the notes last appeared, fragment linked to the city section.
# Copy/paste the latest planning notes from this page
# Remove the now-archived planning notes from this page.
