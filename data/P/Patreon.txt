=== Funding Change 2017 ===
On 2017-12-07, Patreon updated their fee structure so that site users now pay a transaction fee in addition to their pledge amount. This transaction fee consists of a 2.9% handling charge, together with a flat $0.35 service charge. While previously all transaction fees were 'silently' taken on the backend, so that (for users in the USA) a $1 pledge resulted in a charge of $1, the new structure means a $1 pledge will cost this user (called a 'patron' in site nomenclature) $1.38. For European users the new structure means that a $1 pledge results in a charge of approximately $1.70, meaning that creators now receive a mere 55% of the total payment at the $1 pledge level. 

A further change to the funding model is that while pre-December 2017 all of a patron's pledges were collected on the first of the month, the new structure means that all payments will be collected on the monthly anniversary of the original pledge. This means that (for example) if a user had pledged $1 to forty different creators, Patreon would now collect $15 in service charges alone.

As a consequence, Patreon creators are reporting a significant number of their 'patrons' cancelling their pledges.

=== Its Going Down ===
On 2017-07-28, Patreon took down the account for ''It's Going Down'' (IGD), allegedly based on pressure from the Alt-Right. IGD was not given their money for the month of July or any way to contact/export their list of patrons.
