'''<dfn>[https://patreon.com Patreon]</dfn>''' is a crowd-based, recurring funding site to support and pay content creators.

== Criticism ==
* On 2017-07-28, Patreon took down the account for ''It's Going Down'' (IGD), allegedly based on pressure from the Alt-Right. IGD was not given their money for the month of July or any way to contact/export their list of patrons.
