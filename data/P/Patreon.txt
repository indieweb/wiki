'''<dfn>[https://patreon.com Patreon]</dfn>''' is a crowd-based, recurring funding site to support and pay content creators.

* On 2017-12-07, Patreon updated their fee structure so that the patrons now pay the transaction fee on top of their pledge amount. Previously the transaction fee was taken on the backend. This means a $1 pledge will cost a patron in the United States $1.38. For European users the new structure means that a $1 pledge results in a charge of approximately $1.70, meaning that creators now receive a mere 55% of the total payment at the $1 pledge level. Patreon creators are reporting a lot of their patrons cancelling their pledges as a result.

* On 2017-07-28, Patreon took down the account for ''It's Going Down'' (IGD), allegedly based on pressure from the Alt-Right. IGD was not given their money for the month of July or any way to contact/export their list of patrons.
