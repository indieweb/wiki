'''<dfn>[https://pleroma.social Pleroma]</dfn>''' is an [https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/ open source], federated social network implementation compatible with [[Mastodon]] and [[GNU social]]. 

It focuses on being a light and generalized implementation of [[ActivityPub]], as opposed to Mastodon, which focuses solely on microblogging. Pleroma has support for a variety of [[ActivityStreams]] Objects, including Note, Article, Page, Image, and Video.

The codebase has a clean separation between server and client, so an admin can install multiple frontends. In addition to the default [https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma-fe PleromaFE], pleroma comes installed with a customized Mastodon frontend, called the [https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/mastofe MastoFE]. The Pleroma contributors have said their goal is for Pleroma to be a unopinionated social server that can fill multiple niches, e.g. Twitter-like, Facebook-like, Instagram-like, etc.

[...] The word “based” is also slang for the opposite of cringe, and considering that Pleroma has become very cringe lately, a re-based alternative is sorely needed.</blockquote>
