== IndieWeb Requests ==
=== To Be Proposed ===
These are ideas/suggestions for Pleroma to support more IndieWeb [[building blocks]]. Feel free to file them in https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/-/issues and then move them (and their issue link) to the '''Requests''' section below.
* [[IndieAuth]] support (both sign-in with IndiAuth, and use of a Pleroma profile as an IndieAuth identity to sign-in elsewhere)
* [[Micropub]] server support
* [[Webmention]] support, sending & receiving for posts and profiles
* ...

=== Requests ===
TBD.

== Internal Architecture ==
The Pleroma codebase has a clean separation between server and client, so an admin can install multiple frontends. 

In addition to the default [https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma-fe PleromaFE], it comes installed with a customized Mastodon frontend, called the [https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/mastofe MastoFE]. The Pleroma contributors have said their goal is for Pleroma to be an unopinionated social server that can fill multiple niches, e.g. Twitter-like, Facebook-like, Instagram-like, etc.

[...] The word “based” is also slang for the opposite of cringe, and considering that Pleroma has become very cringe lately, a re-based alternative is sorely needed.</blockquote>
