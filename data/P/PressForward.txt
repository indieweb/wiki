'''<dfn>[http://pressforward.org/ PressForward]</dfn>''' is free software built for [[WordPress]] for curating and sharing content from the web. While originally developed for journalists curating content, its core functionality adds a native [[RSS]] [[feed reader]] into one's site.

PressForward helps you:
* Collect via a [[feed reader]] and a [[bookmarklet]]
* Discuss through collaborative editorial work
* Share with a workflow for republishing content
