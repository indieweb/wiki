[[User:atomicules.co.uk|atomicules]] has gotten [[POSSE]] to Pinboard working using [[Jekyll]] combined with [https://fossil.atomicules.co.uk/jekyll-indieweb/home custom deploy/syndication scripts] on atomicules.co.uk since 2015-03-31

== Software ==
* WordPress Syndication Links plugin supports POSSEing to Pinboard

== Issues ==
=== Lack of programmatic permalinks ===
It does not seem possible to obtain the Bookmark ID as a return value when adding a bookmark via the [https://pinboard.in/api/ API], thus unclear how to automatically create permalinks to POSSEd posts. This means it isn't possible to add a [https://indiewebcamp.com/posts-elsewhere#Suggested_Markup u-syndication] link to the syndicated copy on the original post.
