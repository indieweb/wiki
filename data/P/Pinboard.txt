== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== atomicules ===
[[User:atomicules.co.uk|atomicules]] has gotten [[POSSE]] to Pinboard working using [[Jekyll]] combined with [http://atomicules.co.uk:8080/jekyll-indieweb/home custom deploy/syndication scripts] on atomicules.co.uk since 2015-03-31
* Original link post: http://atomicules.co.uk/2015/03/31/Cycling-Near-Misses.html
* Pinboard POSSE copy: https://pinboard.in/u:atomicules/b:c7f8e05271e5

== Issues ==
=== POSSE ===
It does not seem possible to obtain the Bookmark ID as a return value when adding a bookmark via the [https://pinboard.in/api/ API]. This means it isn't possible to add a [https://indiewebcamp.com/posts-elsewhere#Suggested_Markup u-syndication] link to the syndicated copy on the original post.
