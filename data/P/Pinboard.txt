== Software ==
* WordPress Syndication Links plugin supports POSSEing to Pinboard

== Issues ==
=== Lack of programmatic permalinks ===
It does not seem possible to obtain the Bookmark ID as a return value when adding a bookmark via the [https://pinboard.in/api/ API], thus unclear how to automatically create permalinks to POSSEd posts. This means it isn't possible to add a [https://indiewebcamp.com/posts-elsewhere#Suggested_Markup u-syndication] link to the syndicated copy on the original post.
