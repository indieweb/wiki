'''<dfn>[https://pronoun.is Pronoun Island]</dfn>''' is software written in Clojure allowing the hosting of a website listing personal pronouns (including arbitrary pronouns or commonly-used ones via templates) with usage examples; it is also the [[dogfooding|demonstration]] of this software for English example sentences (the creator [https://github.com/witch-house/pronoun.is/issues/66 encourages] [[self-hosted]] versions for other languages, optionally with a 'pun-based domain name' like the English site; thus, [[localisation]] is chosen over [[internationalisation]]).
