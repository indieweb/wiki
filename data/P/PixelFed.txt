** "[tantek]: Hi, Pixelfed developer here. We do not yet support microformats or micropub but those are on our roadmap!" [ @dansup] January 2, 2020

=== IndieAuth ===
2023-07-17: IndieWeb friendly progress: looking to add [[IndieAuth]] support! 

<blockquote>"We are working on OIDC support, and exploring IndieAuth!

The Sign-in with Mastodon feature uses Mastodon specific APIs and is a temporary measure until we get OIDC in place and other platforms support it!"
<cite>https://mastodon.social/@pixelfed/110731182392091206</cite></blockquote>

2019-03-02: {{jacky}} filed a GitHub issue for IndieAuth https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed/issues/935

== Criticism ==
* 2025-12-04 [https://ploum.net/2025-12-04-pixelfed-against-fediverse.html Is Pixelfed sawing off the branch that the Fediverse is sitting on?]
<blockquote>The Pixelfed app has unilaterally decided not to display most Fediverse posts for the arbitrary reason that they do not contain a picture.</blockquote>
* 2025-30-25 [https://fokus.cool/2025/03/25/pixelfed-vulnerability.html Pixelfed leaks private posts from other Fediverse instances]
<blockquote>When following someone on a different server on the Fediverse, the remote server decides whether you are allowed to do so. This enables features like private accounts. Due to an implementation mistake, Pixelfed ignores this and allows anyone to follow even private accounts on other servers. When a legitimate user from a Pixelfed instance follows you on your locked fediverse account, anyone on that Pixelfed instance can read your private posts. You don’t need to be a Pixelfed user to be affected.</blockquote>
