'''<dfn>[https://github.com/photo The Photo Project]</dfn>''' (formerly Trovebox, before that OpenPhoto â€” still mentioned in source/docs) was a photo application [[project]] that lets you store your photos on Dropbox, Amazon S3, or in your garage, and serve them from URLs on your own domain. 

== Formerly ==
=== Trovebox ===
2015-03-31 site-death: The Photo Project used to be Trovebox, both an open source project by that name, and an online service to "organize and share [[photos]] and [[videos]] with clients and colleagues" at trovebox.com (parked [[GoDaddy]] domain as of 2016-05-16) which [[site-deaths#Trovebox|shut down]] as of 2015-03-31. The code was kept as open source, though, if you want to maintain a version on your own site.

2013 service focus over open source: Before trovebox.com shutdown, development on the open source, self-hosted "Trovebox Community Edition" appears to have slowed dramatically in [http://www.ohloh.net/p/openphoto mid-2013], possibly to focus on the commercial [http://trovebox.com Trovebox] product (Need more info on this).

=== OpenPhoto ===
Before Trovebox, the project and service was known as OpenPhoto, at theopenphotoproject.org which as of 2016-05-16 returns a 403 PHP error: <blockquote><strong><big>Forbidden</big></strong><p>You don't have permission to access /php.cgi/index.html on this server.</p></blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWebCamp participants who are using it on their own site:
* [[User:Upon2020.com]] (Johannes Ernst) is running a private instance for his family pictures
* ...

=== Former Examples ===
* [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]] (Barnaby Walters) http://waterpigs.co.uk/ was running an instance of Trovebox to host his photos at http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/ - it's now dead/offline, "pending transfer of relevant content to Taproot". <blockquote>I could probably attempt to debug the JS-related problem but would rather put that time into making getting Taproot displaying photo posts better. -Barnaby</blockquote>

== Criticism ==
=== Insufficient Selfdogfooding ===
Insufficient Selfdogfooding. Of the 13 "core team" creators listed on the site only one is self-hosting an instance of Trovebox/OpenPhoto. And it appears to be broken. (based on links from [http://theopenphotoproject.org/team http://theopenphotoproject.org/team] because there does not appear to be a list of Trovebox creators). No known functioning [[selfdogfood]]ing of Trovebox/OpenPhoto.

=== Poor odd image size handling ===
Poor small/odd image size handling - <blockquote>"I have found it sub-optimal for small images (it scales them up to horrible dimensions) and weirdly shaped images (screenshots/panoramas, both of which i do a lot)" - [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-04-16#t1366140083 Barnabywalters on IRC]</blockquote>

=== Poor integration ===
Poor integration - Trovebox fails to easily integrate with any other posting software, e.g. for posting [[notes]], [[articles]], and photos into a single stream on your homepage.

=== Poor stream management ===
Poor stream management - <blockquote>"it's fine as a full photo management stack, that's just not what I want in terms of publishing a photo stream." - [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-04-16#t1366140041 aaronpk on IRC]</blockquote>

=== Reliance on Javascript ===
Login and Gallery pages both rely on [[Javascript]] in order to function, and the latest checkout has several javascript bugs which prevent them from working correctly.
