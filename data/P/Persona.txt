<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Persona Persona]</dfn>''' was an [[email]]-based authentication service from [[Mozilla]] that was supported by [[IndieAuth]] for [[rel-me]] links to email addresses; it was [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers shut down November 30, 2016].</span>

Previously, Persona was summarized at https://web.archive.org/web/20160123160415/https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/ (original link <nowiki>http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/</nowiki> is 404 as of 2024)

Persona is based on the BrowserID protocol for authenticating users based on email address

Some fans of Persona have started a "spiritual successor" called [[Portier]].

== Past IndieWeb Examples ==
Past examples of IndieWeb sites which acted as their own Persona provider, without relying on delegation to another email provider, or to the Mozilla default provider.
* ... add yourself if you have some historical documentation of doing this

Examples of IndieWeb sites which consumed (allowed login via) Persona in particular (beyond using IndieAuth to do so).
* [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris.org]] - although people other than me don't really get to do much other than enjoy the fact that it says "You are signed in as {your email}".
** 2017-02-21 - functionality removed following Persona shutdown - switched to [[IndieAuth]]

== Shutdowns ==
The following sites used to provide or accept (consume) Persona logins but no longer do. Most recent first:
* 2014-06-10 '''orchestrate.io''' is phasing out Persona login. The next time you sign in they require you to set a password.[http://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/06/10/userauth/]

Shutdown of Persona services itself:

== Criticisms ==
=== Reliance on JavaScript ===
Persona/browserid [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona/The_implementor_s_guide/Supporting_users_without_JavaScript relies on JavaScript] to work, forcing consumers to implement separate authentication functionality to support all users (e.g. users without [[JavaScript]] or when it fails to load).

** "1/ On the occasion of the launch of @apple's "Sign in with Apple," allow me to indulge in a walk down a memory lane called @MozillaPersona -- the project I loved and led at Mozilla 6-8 years ago, the project that broke my heart. This is my take, I'm sure it's incomplete." [https://twitter.com/benadida @benadida] June 4, 2019
