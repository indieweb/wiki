https://indieweb.org/POSSE

'''<dfn>POSSE</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for '''Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere''', a content publishing model that starts with posting content on your own domain first, then syndicating out copies to 3rd party services with [[permashortlinks]] back to the original on your site.

== Why ==
'''Let your friends read your posts, their way.''' POSSE lets your friends keep using whatever they use to read your stuff (e.g. [[silo]] aggregators like [[Facebook]], [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]], etc.).

'''Stay in touch with friends now''', not some theoretical future. POSSE is about staying in touch with current friends now, rather than the potential of staying in touch with friends in the future. 

'''Friends are more important than federation.''' By focusing on actual social relationships that matter to people rather than architectural ideals, from a human perspective, POSSE is more important than [[federation]]. Additionally, if federated approaches take a POSSE approach first, they will likely get better adoption (everyone wants to stay in touch with their friends), and thereby more rapidly approach that federated future.

'''POSSE is beyond blogging.''' It's a key part of why and how the IndieWeb movement is [[different]] from just "everyone blog on their own site", and also different from "everyone just install and run (YourFavoriteSocialSoftware)" etc. [[monoculture]] solutions.

=== Why In General ===
<span id="Advantages">POSSE is considered a robust and preferable syndication model</span> for the following reasons:

* '''Reduce 3rd party dependence.''' By posting directly to your own site, you're not dependent on 3rd Party services to do so -- if you can access your site, you can publish your content. On the contrary with PESOS, [https://twitter.com/colinjohnston/status/772533151960707072 when the 3rd party site is down], you are unable to add content.
* '''Ownership.''' By posting ''first'' on your own site, you create a direct ownership chain that can be traced back to you without any intervening 3rd party services (silos) TOS's getting in the way (which is a vulnerability of [[PESOS]]).
* '''Own canonical URLs to your content.''' Canonical URLs to your content are on your domain.
* '''Copies can cite the original.''' By posting content first to your own site (and thus creating a permalink for it), copies that you post on 3rd Party services can link or cite the original on your site (see [[syndication_formats]] and [[Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_Twitter|POSSE Notes to Twitter]])
* '''Better search.''' Searching public content on your own domain (with any web search engine of your choice) works better than depending on [[silos]] exclusively to search your posts (e.g. Twitter for a while only showed recent tweets in search results. [[Facebook]] still has very poor search results).
* [[backfeed]] can be used to pull in (reverse syndicate) responses from other services
* allows taking advantage of other services' social layers and aggregation features while storing the canonical copy of your content on your own site
* ...

=== Why Link To Your Original ===
Common [[POSSE]] practice is to link from POSSE copies to your original, using a [[permashortlink]]. Here are a few reasons why:

* '''Discovery of your original content.''' [[discovery]] of your original content from the copies on 3rd party services is enabled by the permashortlinks to your originals posted on said services
* '''Subvert spammers who copy your posts.''' When spammers (e.g. @sin3rss) mindlessly copy from your POSSE copies and repost, they also copy the link back to the original, and thus provide more distribution for people to find and view your original post. "[http://tantek.com/2011/009/t3/value-searching-finding-past-tweets-self-hosting 2011-01-09 internet aikido]" of a sort.
* '''Better ranking for your original posts.''' If/when your POSSE copies are themselves copied by others and (re)posted elsewhere (e.g. manual retweets, RSS bots etc.), when the copies link to your original posts, search engines figure that out by following those links back to the original and ranking it higher.

== How To Implement ==
=== In General ===
In general, when your content posting software posts something, it should also post a copy to the [[silo]] destinations of your choice, with an [[original post link]] (e.g. [[permashortlink]] or [[permashortcitation]]) back to your original.

The details of how to do so vary per destination. See the silo-specific sections below.

Once you have posted the copy to the silo, you should:
* link to the syndicated copy from the original in a '''[[posts-elsewhere]]''' section on your post.

=== Twitter ===
{{main|Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter}}
[[Twitter]] is perhaps the most popular POSSE destination and a good place to start.

If you can start posting notes (tweets) to your own site and POSSEing to Twitter, <em>instead of</em> posting directly to Twitter, you have taken a big step towards owning your data.

Details:
* API Access - [https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-update.html posting new tweets] works nicely due to permanent API tokens, and the return value contains a URL to the posted
* Supports very complete web action endpoints, so semi-manual posting is easy to implement

See [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSE to Twitter]] for details on how to POSSE both notes and articles (blog posts) to Twitter.

=== Facebook ===
{{main|POSSE to Facebook}}

* API Access - New posts can be created through the API using the [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/ Publishing API]
* <s>A web action endpoint (<code>https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed</code>) is supplied by the Feed social plugin for semi-manual posting. Requires a facebook app id, but no authentication. It accepts a callback URL, to which it redirects with ?post_id GET param set, from which a URL can be constructed.</s>
** Appears to no longer be functioning as of 2016-03-13 --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 04:38, 13 March 2016 (PDT)

=== Google Plus ===
{{main|Google+#POSSE}}
* No write API (yet)
* There are several endpoints which can be used as web action dialogs, but none of them support callbacks, so it’s trick to get the URL of the posted copy.
** Mobile App endpoint: <code>https://m.google.com/app/plus/x/?content=INSERT_MESSAGE_HERE_WITH_URL_IF_YOU_WANT&v=compose&hideloc=1</code>
** Share button endpoint: <code>https://plus.google.com/share?url=</code> (doesn’t support text injection as far as I can tell --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 14:41, 7 December 2012 (PST))
* The WordPress plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/ Social Network Auto-Poster (SNAP)] utilizes a mobile web work around to POSSE WordPress posts to Google+. {{chrisaldrich}} tried it for a while in June 2016, but it requires deactivating second factor authentication on Google to work properly, so he abandoned the method.

=== Medium ===
{{main|Medium}}
* You can create posts via [https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs the posts API]
* Medium also supports manual POSSE via [https://medium.com/@Medium/import-all-the-things-578c8f9016f6#.e8mh2dyws the Import Post function], which preserves [[rel-canonical]] links to the original URL
* {{shaners}} and {{benwerd}} manually POSSE to Medium
* {{chrisaldrich}} uses the WordPress [https://wordpress.org/plugins/medium/ Medium Plugin] to POSSE to Medium. They also [https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/218572107-How-to-move-to-Medium support bulk migration] (aka mass POSSE) for porting across lots of posts after which posts can be POSSEd by means of their plugin.
* {{aaron gustafson}} Wrote a [https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-crosspost-to-medium Jekyll plugin] to POSSE to Medium.

=== WordPress ===
{{main|WordPress}}
* How does veganstraightedge.com do it? (all his articles are manually POSSEd to WordPress.com)
* {{chrisaldrich}} uses a WordPress plugin [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost/ WordPress Crosspost] to POSSE from a self-hosted WordPress install to WordPress.com.

=== Plain Text Notes ===
Some destinations (e.g. [[SMS]] or [[push notification|push notifications]]) may require a pure plain text representation.
* [[h-entry_to_text]] is a method of generating a plain text representation from an arbitrary [[h-entry]]

=== Software ===
Software and libraries to implement POSSE:
* PHP
** The POSSE namespace in [https://github.com/barnabywalters/php-helpers php-helpers] (might be moved to a separate package) contains various truncation, preparation and syndication functions including HTML => plaintext µblog syntax converter
* Python
** [https://bolt80.com/silorider/ SiloRider] is a command-line tool, implemented in Python, that lets you implement POSSE to various services (Twitter and Mastodon as of 2018-08-01).

=== Services ===
* [[Bridgy]] [https://www.brid.gy/about#publish Publish] is POSSE-as-a-service. It supports [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]] (currently just likes). You can use it interactively or programmatically via [[webmention]].
* [https://muggedtweets.com/ Mugged Tweets] - will POSSE a note to a mug (may require first POSSEing to Twitter)
* [https://ifttt.com/ IFTTT] allows automatically reposting content with an RSS or Atom feed to a number of silos incuding Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook

=== Publishing Flows ===
There's at least two ways to implement a POSSE content posting flow:

==== Client to site to silo ====
* The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client
** Optional: client provides UI for selecting which 3rd party services to push to if it knows about them, with optional customizations for per service
* Having finished the content, the user publishes content to their server (optionally: with metadata of which 3rd party services and any customizations thereof)
** Optional: client can generate a permalink knowing the state of the server, and publish to that permalink
* The server publishes the content, generates a permalink and summary (and/or customized content suited to 3rd party services) if necessary
* The server posts copies with permalinks to 3rd party services

Advantages:
* User only has to interact with one site over the internet, their own
* Syndication can be done fully automatically by the server
Disadvantages:
* any?

==== Client to site and silo ====
* The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client
* Having finished the content, the user publishes it to their server
* The client queries the server for the URL of the content it just pushed
* The publishing client presents the user with an interface for selecting:
** Which 3rd party services to publish to
** The exact content published to the services, pre-filled with a summary based on the produced content
* The user selects the services and submits the form
* The publishing client posts the content summaries out to the 3rd party services

Advantages:
* More user control over timing and editing of copies of content to 3rd party services
Disadvantages:
* Syndication requires a manual step each time
* Dependent on client connectivity directly to 3rd party services (problematic in flakey mobile situations, or when client is publishing using domain-censored internet access).

=== Sandeep Shetty ===
'''[[User:Sandeep.io]]''' First post POSSE'd on 2012-11-05. I primarily syndicate to Twitter using a very lo-fi solution of adding silo (Facebook, Twiiter, Google+) provided share links to each post that I can manually click to prefill content, edit and post. I've avoided API integration because of the extensive experience I've had using Facebook API and dealing with it's random changes. "Integration" has high costs sometimes so I keep it as simple as possible.

=== Ben Werdmuller ===

[[User:Benwerd.com|Ben Werdmuller]] implemented POSSE in his [http://idno.co idno] platform via plugins. New content has an associated Activity Streams object type; POSSE plugins listen for post events associated with those object types and syndicate appropriately.
* Notes and articles are syndicated to Twitter and Facebook
* Images are syndicated to Facebook, Flickr and Twitter
* Places are syndicated to Foursquare
* More plugins are very easily possible; the Foursquare plugin took about an hour to build

** POSSE copy: https://twitter.com/adamdawkins/status/1085327551415894016

=== ... add more here ... ===
... Add a link to your POSSE–enabled site and the date you started syndicating copies of your content out to 3rd party social sharing/publishing services.

=== Partial POSSE sites ===
Sites which only POSSE some of their content, and still post directly to the same silo they POSSE to.

Other partial POSSE sites:

* '''[[User:Hupili.net]]''' implements a partial POSSE with the following setups:
** [[SNSAPI]] is a lightweight middleware to unify the data structure and interfaces of different social networking services. It gives the scripting flexibility for developer users to manipulate social silos. 
** [[SNSRouter]] is a web UI built upon SNSAPI where one can read an aggregated timeline from different sites, mass forward messages, and update statuses on all channels. 
** As is said in one of the description paragraph above, this model is not truly POSSE. One can not (hardly) distinguish original/ syndicated status. I'm planning to put a page with permlink on my site upon each status update and then use SNSAPI to syndicate to other silos.

== Other Approaches ==
=== PESOS ===
A similar but opposite approach is [[PESOS]] where content is posted first to 3rd party services and then copied/syndicated into a personal site. 

If exact copies of content are posted on both a personal site and 3rd party services, there's no way to tell (short of comparing possibly non-existent sub-second accurate published dates) whether a site is using POSSE or PESOS. Sites can provably support POSSE by including perma(short)links in syndicated copies that link/reference back to published originals.

=== PESETAS ===
[[PESETAS]] is like PESOS but copying/syndicating everything to a particular silo (without any involvement of a personal site).

For example, most silos support cross-posting to [[Twitter]], thus you could connect everything to your Twitter account and always (auto-)cross-post there to keep a copy. 

E.g. [[Tumblr]] has a UI for cross-posting to [[Twitter]]. See [http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15315/customize-the-message-tumblr-sends-to-twitter Webapps StackExchange post] for documentation and screenshots of UI.

Tumblr is a better PESETAS destination however, since it is well established, allows for a wider variety of content, and allows more text, and links to URLs directly instead of linkwrapping them like Twitter does.


== Brainstorming ==
=== CRUD ===
All of the above, and to date (2013-222), POSSE has solely described syndicating the <b>C</b>reation of content on your site (publishing) to other sites. This model has been quite successful and perhaps may be sufficient.

However, it is worth exploring the potential utility of a full CRUD protocol for POSSE.

=== Create ===
Create is the POSSE default. You create content on your site, you POSSE your creates to other sites. All of this is described above, and in silo-specific details on [[silo]] pages.

=== Read ===
Read as a verb is interesting when applied to POSSE.

At a minimum, it's useful to implement storing links to syndicated copies of your content to provide for the future possibility of reading from downstream POSSE copies.

See: 
* [[u-syndication]] for how to markup links to syndicated copies of your content
* [[syndication-link-use-cases]] for why to do so

Actual direct uses of Reading from downstream POSSE copies:
* reverse-syndication / [[backfeed]] of activity around the POSSE copy onto your original:
** [[comments]]/replies
** [[favorites]]/likes
** [[reposts]] (retweets)

In addition, keeping a [[u-syndication]] link to the POSSE copy enables deleting it to perform an Update or a Delete action, as described in the following sections.

=== Update ===
If a POSSE destination allows updates/edits, then when you edit your post, you could propagate that update to the downstream POSSE copy as well.
* E.g. [[Facebook]] allows editing the text of a post (including any links in the text), person tags, but not the image of a photo post

If the destination disallows updates/edits, like [[Twitter]], it is still possible to virtually POSSE updates by deleting the POSSE tweet and reposting, i.e.:

Consider only POSSEing updates to Twitter:
* if no one has replied to it yet (otherwise you'd break a threaded conversation on Twitter)
* if your changes would be shown in the truncated copy on Twitter (i.e. if your changes are past the 140 (more like 120) character horizon, no point in churning the Twitter copy).
* within a very short time window, maybe like 2-5 minutes, because otherwise the update will be seen as a duplicate to people who are reading you on Twitter.
All of these concerns are regarding the experience that you provide to your friends reading your tweets on Twitter, which of course should be the whole (design) reason you're bothering to POSSE to Twitter in the first place.

For details, see silo-specific POSSE sections:
* [[Facebook]]: [[POSSE to Facebook]] ([[to-do]]: needs details re: edit text ok, but no photo editing, photo posts need delete/repost to simulate POSSE update)
* [[Flickr]]: (UI supports manually updating the image of a photo post, but is that available in the API? and if so, file a [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request GitHub issue to support POSSE Update to Flickr (including the image of a photo post)
* [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|Twitter: POSSE to Twitter]] ([[to-do]]: copy the above delete/repost strategy to there)
* ...

=== Delete ===
Deletes seem fairly straightforward to POSSE, especially to services which themselves propagate deletes to clients.

E.g. one can delete a note on Twitter at any point.

Similar to updates, consider:
* if there are already replies to a POSSE copy (or activity like favorites/retweets), consider keeping it to keep conversation threading (and others' favorites/retweets). 

However, if you really feel like deleting the content from your site and POSSE copies (e.g. on Twitter), go ahead and do so. 

Perhaps this is an opportunity for the UI for the deletion of a post to check to see if there's been any activity (replies, favorites, retweets) on the POSSE copy before performing the delete. One possible implementation could involve the UI informing the user of this activity (or lack of it) and reconfirming the delete request on a per-service basis.


==== IndieWeb Examples ====

* {{grantcodes}} supports POSSE deletes on twitter as of 2018-10-10, by checking if a post on his site has been unpublished / deleted and sending the appropriate api request for likes, reposts and notes.

== FAQ ==
=== Worry about search engines and duplicates ===
Q: Do we need to worry about search engines penalizing apparently duplicate posts?

A: That's why the POSSE copies SHOULD always link back to the originals. So that search engines can infer that the copies are just copies. Ideally POSSE copies on silos should use [[rel-canonical]] to link back to the originals, but even without explicit rel-canonical, the explicit link back to the original is a strong hint that it is an original.

This is also an advantage of POSSE over PESOS. With PESOS - there's no way to tell what's the original and what's the copy - so they do look like duplicates.

=== POSSE-post-discovery and backlinks ===
Q: Brid.gy can use [[posse-post-discovery]] to find the relationship between a syndicated post and the original when there is not explicit link. Does this mean I should stop adding backlinks to syndicated copies?

A: POSSEing without a backlink is considered a last resort, and has some costs associated with it. See [[posse-post-discovery#Tradeoffs]] for more details.

=== POSSE or Send Webmentions First ===
In short, '''[[POSSE]] first, then send [[webmentions]]'''.

See: [[Webmention-faq#POSSE_or_Send_Webmentions_First|Webmention FAQ: POSSE or Send Webmentions First]] for details and reasoning.

Arrows outward are conceptually illustrating [[POSSE]], while those returning, [[backfeed]]. <br/> See 2011-01-10 post relating/expanding on it: [http://tantek.com/2011/010/b1/owning-your-data On Owning Your Data: Follow-up to @Zeldman and the #indieweb]
* 2011-06-25 IndieWebCamp 2011 session: "[[2011/Publish_Then_Syndicate_and_Replicate|Publish Then Syndicate and Replicate]]" further explored POSSE conceptually.
* 2012-06-21 <i>POSSE</i> term defined: http://tantek.com/2012/173/t1/posse-core-indieweb-approach

Related conceptually:
* sometime before 2014-06-21[http://tantek.com/2012/173/t1/posse-core-indieweb-approach]: <i>[[POSE]]</i> (Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere) term defined at some point prior to POSSE. Conceptually it was looser than POSSE, as "once" could be interpreted as on a silo rather than your "own site", which POSSE (and the conceptual predecessors) made explicit.

== POSSE as methodology for non-web scenarios ==

=== POSSE git repositories ===
As discussed #indieweb it is also possible POSSE your git repositories to git "silos", such as [[GitHub]] or [[GitLab]]. An easy way of doing this was described by {{cweiske}} at [https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-12-16#t1481891974356000].

* HN ibid: "Why won't a link on these platforms suffice since they have their "cards"?"
* HN ibid: "This is an interesting thing, but too complicated and over-broad for the mere-mortal." <-- page introduction needs simplifying, simpler instructions to setup POSSE, acknowledge where POSSE usability is in the [[Generations]] spectrum
* HN ibid: "Facebook is just a glorified RSS feed with centralized discover ability." <-- debunk with comparing [[Facebook#Features]] (and [[Twitter#Features]]) vs RSS plumbing feature set. A visual diagram/table comparison might help.
* HN ibid: "This really is not possible with RSS at all, especially since the silos don’t want to support RSS in any meaningful way." <-- perhaps add a whole subsection in "Why" explaining why RSS is insufficient compared to POSSE.
