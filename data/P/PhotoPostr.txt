'''<dfn>PhotoPostr</dfn>''' is a [[Micropub]] client for posting [[photo-album|photo albums]]. It is available at [https://photo.postrchild.com photo.postrchild.com]

== About ==

PhotoPostr is created by [[User:Grant.codes|Grant Richmond]] using a simple [[node.js]] backend and a [[React]] frontend.

PhotoPostr is able to handle very large photo albums. [[User:Grant.codes|Grant Richmond]] has successfully posted a 1.42GB album of 92 photos. [https://grant.codes/2017/11/23/5a172628023c9d2ae6fbbe9a View the created album]

== Photo Handling ==

PhotoPostr posts photos to the [[micropub media endpoint]] and will create an individual [[photo]] post for each post. Photos are created with the "gallery-photo" category, the user will probably want to hide these posts from their feeds and only show the actual album post.

When uploading photos PhotoPostr will look at the [[Exif]] data of the photos it receives and maps some of the properties to the appropriate micropub properties. This includes:

* Name from the filename 
* Date from the exif original date
* Location from the exif GPS latitude and longitude

Users can then edit all these properties as well as the content of the [[photo]] post as well as drag and drop photos to reorder them.

== Album Posts ==

The [[photo-album|album post]] is created with a collection of children (the individual photo posts). At the time of writing since a lot of micropub endpoints do not handle children PhotoPostr also sends a collection property with the urls to the photo posts.

Album posts will have the category "gallery".

Album posts also support a name, content and slug.
