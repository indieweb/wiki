{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Portable Contacts</dfn>''' (often abbreviated as <abbr>PoCo</abbr>) was a proposed 2008 specification for exchange of vCard-compatible contact info using a one-off [[JSON]] format, before [[microformats2]], its parsed canonical JSON format, and h-card was specified.

The portablecontacts.net domain [[site-deaths#Portable_Contacts|died in 2016]] and returned in ~2 months as a [[zombie]] site (still zombie in 2018), eventually with various bits of plagiarized content on multiple pages that link to a consulting company.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no known IndieWeb sites publishing or consuming PoCo.

IndieWeb sites are alternatively publishing [[h-card]] (and [[hCard]]). 

Using a [[microformats2]] parser, you can get a canonical [[JSON]] representation of [[h-card]] contact information.
