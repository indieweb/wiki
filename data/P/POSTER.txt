{{stub}}

'''<dfn>POSTER</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Then Enlarged Reproduction, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then printing out a large version to put on a board or sign, like to carry to a protest or march, to [[reach]] more people in person, especially where there is media coverage. Great use-case for retypable permashortlinks to provide viewers a way to directly interacting with your content online.
