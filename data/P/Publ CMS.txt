'''<dfn>[http://publ.beesbuzz.biz/ Publ]</dfn>''' is a [[CMS]] written in Python. It is billed as "like a static site generator, only dynamic."

Its design is based on static publishing systems such as [[Jekyll]] or [[Pelican]], but rather than generate static HTML content, it instead dynamically maps index and entry views to page/entry content based on metadata. It's specifically designed to allow for heterogeneous types of content; for example, [https://beesbuzz.biz/ the author's site] uses the same publishing framework to provide vastly-different presentation and, in some cases, navigation mechanisms for disparate content types such as music, comics, art, and blogs.

It's also designed to keep "legacy" links intact; for example, an entry or category view can claim ownership of an older URL, and it's relatively simple to add regular expression-based URL rewriting as well. Further, if an entry is moved to a different part of the site, old links to its prior location(s) will be automatically redirected to the new permalink.

Another core tenet is that images are rendered based on the page template's requirements, and image renditions support high-DPI displays by default. Individual entries can also override the template rules as necessary, and can even specify different overrides based on which template is rendering it.

While Publ itself doesn't contain any IndieWeb functionality, it is generally a trivial matter to add such functionality in the page templates. For example, the [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ-templates-beesbuzz.biz beesbuzz.biz templates] support [[microformats]], [[Atom]] (including  [[WebSub]]), [[Webmention]] (both outgoing and incoming, via [[webmention.io]] and client-side JavaScript), and [[ActivityPub]] via [[Bridgy Fed]]. 
Publ is provided as a Python library that is installable via PyPI, and can run on any WSGI-based hosting (including [[Heroku]] and [[Dreamhost]]).
