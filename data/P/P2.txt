* Where does one submit a patch / pull request for P2?

== Issues ==
=== missing microformats support ===
P2 appears to be lacking the needed classic [[hAtom]] microformat class names to work well with the default [[hentry]] markup that WordPress core provides. Without knowing where to browse the source and/or submit patches (see FAQ above), it's difficult to fix this problem.

Workaround:
* Install the [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 wordpress-uf2 plugin] as suggested in the [[WordPress#microformats]] section. According to WordPress user {{snarfed}}, this will add microformats class names to P2.
