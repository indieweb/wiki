The '''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/ Post Kinds Plugin]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that adds support for responding and interacting with other sites to the classic editor WordPress. It does this by implementing [[post kinds]].

For the general IndieWeb concept of "Post Kinds", see:
* {{main|post type#Kinds of Posts|Kinds of Posts}}

The Post Kinds Plugin makes it clear when your post is a reply or a like of someone else's post. It can also distinguish notes, articles and photos as a drop in replacement for WordPress [http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats post formats].

* WordPress Repository: 
* GitHub development version: https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-post-kinds
** It's preferred that issues be filed on GitHub

== Why == 
There are other ways to achieve the same results in WordPress...for example, marking up your content with microformats manually within the post editor.

The Post Kinds plugin aims to simplify by a 'fill in the blanks' approach to post kinds within the WordPress post editor. It adds in the fields and settings, making it easier to create new posts. It also automatically parses URLs to display rich context.

The latest version supports displaying additional microformat properties stored as post metadata that may not have the added fields in the WordPress Post UI.

== Technical ==
The plugin creates a taxonomy called Kind, which consists of [[post kinds]] such as Reply, Repost, RSVP, Like, Favorite, and Bookmark. It then adds post metadata boxes to the WordPress post editor for a URL, a title, author, author photo, publisher, and citation/excerpt. This allows a post to act as a response to another post, quote, etc. 

The design of the plugin has gone through several revisions, but currently, the model for Post Kinds in terms of behavior is based on the Post Formats feature of WordPress, except with an Indieweb focus.

The post integrates with the [[Webmention Plugin]] to send webmentions to any URL it is responding to.

=== Archive Pages ===
The plugin automatically creates archive pages for the various post types which can be accessed by visiting http://www.example.com/kind/note (or by replacing "note" with the names of any of the other kinds.)

=== RSS ===
RSS feeds can be made available or subscribed to for any of the particular kinds using the following example: http://www.example.com/feed/?kind=note (or by replacing "note" with the other kinds including:  article, bookmark, favorite, jam, like, listen, photo, read, recipe, reply, repost, watch, and wish.


== Future Plans ==
Development and issues are logged in the Github repository at https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-post-kinds/

== Indieweb Taxonomy ==
The Post Kinds plugin was formerly called the Indieweb Taxonomy plugin. The name was changed as part of a rewrite. You should uninstall Taxonomy in favor of the new version if you have it installed.
