'''<dfn>PESOS</dfn>''' is an acronym/abbreviation for '''Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site'''. It's a [[syndication-models|Syndication Model]] where publishing flow starts with posting to 3rd party services, then using some infrastructure (e.g. feeds, pingbacks, [[webhooks]]) to create an archive copy under your domain.

The opposite (and preferable) approach is [[POSSE]], whereby a user publishes original content to their own site, and then syndicates copies to 3rd party services, preferably with perma(short)links back to the originals on their own site.

== Implementations ==
=== IndieWeb Examples ===

==== [[User:Hupili.net|HU, Pili]] ====
Pulls content from multiple silos and present them in his own sites (currently only in form of an RSS feed) using SNSAPI https://github.com/hupili/snsapi
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Renren, the large OSN in China. It's a Facebook like model: http://www.renren.com/
* SinaWeibo, ("weibo" in Chinese means "micro-blog"). It's a twitter like model: http://weibo.com/
* TecentWeibo. It's another micro-blogging service in China. Due to the broad production line of Tecent, TecentWeibo has some unique access point (e.g. WeChat from a mobile device). http://t.qq.com/
* The aggregated status update from those silos: http://hupili.net/feeds/all.xml  . It's currently a mix of all materials. I'll separate the English and Chinese messages later.

==== [[User:Www.flutterby.net_user:danlyke|danlyke]] ====
* Used Twitter export to back-patch Twitter IDs into posts originally syndicated out to Twitter but for which the Twitter ID wasn't originally recovered from the API.
* Uses [https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111?hl=en the Google calendar export] to backup calendar data in his own repository

=== Micropub ===
When creating posts via [[Micropub]], set the [[u-syndication|<code>syndication</code>]] property to the post's original URL. This defines the new post as canonical (original) version of the post.

If you see the new post as the copy of the silo URL, then [[u-syndication|<code>syndication</code>]] is the wrong property - better would be to [[repost]].

== Advantages ==

* '''more API options:''' difference in restrictions in APIs for content creation and content retrieval: sometimes it's possible to pull data which can't be pushed, eg. Facebook comments
* '''native interactions''': the native interfaces are sometimes quite well done for silos
* '''prevents you from oversharing''' the same content to every network (no, that is not good, usually different networks attract different audience and not every content should be shared with everyone)
* '''implementations will be async''':
** breakage in your site/POSSE layer will not prevent you from posting to a silo (those breakages are not as uncommon as one would like them to be)
** static generators can use it as well without losing real-time ability in silos
** circumvents limitations on automated content posting ( [https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-increase-your-traffic-from-facebook-by-650-in-5-seconds/ WPMUdev experiment on automated vs manual post audience reach on Facebook] )

== Disadvantages ==
PESOS is considered less robust and inferior to [[POSSE]] for the following reasons:

* '''Possible loss or restriction of ownership.''' By posting ''first'' on a silo, you are subject to that silo's TOS, both with entering the data and later getting it out. You calling their API or feeds to extract your own data may still shackle your data with some rights to them (e.g. "database copyright" for content contributed to silo collections like [[Foursquare]] venues). You have a ''dependent'' ownership chain for your content (from creation, to syndication/re-use, to consumption), where the silo is an intermediate dependent party that you can never be rid of.
** '''[[Twitter]] Developer Rules of the Road appears to prohibit export to your site''': <blockquote cite="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms"> Exporting Twitter Content to a datastore as a service or other cloud based service, however, is not permitted.[https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms]</blockquote> Discovered via [https://twitter.com/michielbdejong/status/347438063187804161].
* '''Less reliable.''' Your site relies on 3rd Party Services to post any content
** 2014-10-05 E.g. [[Flickr]] https://twitter.com/anomalily/status/518830141502685185
* '''Non-canonical.''' Copes archived to your domain are not a canonical copy
* '''Lower quality.''' Pulling in from 3rd Party Services can reduce the quality of content, e.g.
** character limits (e.g. 140 character [[Twitter]] posts, 200 character Foursquare shouts/tips).
*** this is completely silo-dependent; if your post was intended for a certain silo, there is no quality difference - 2017-06-08 {{ petermolnar }}
** link-wrapping (e.g. Twitter hides all links behind their t.co link-wrapper)
*** links can be followed and extracted, but that requires extra work - 2017-06-08 {{ petermolnar }}
