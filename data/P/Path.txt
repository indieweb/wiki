'''<dfn>[https://path.com Path]</dfn>''' was a content hosting [[silo]] for private sharing of information among a small (limit 150) group of friends. On 2018-09-17, Path announced they would be closing 2018-10-18, with customer service open until 2018-11-15. Originally announced at <nowiki>https://path.com/about</nowiki>, now (2018-11-20) down or unresponsive.

== UI ==
Random bits of UI from Path.com.
=== Limited Reacji ===
Path was perhaps the first content silo to expand beyond [[like]] to a limited set of [[reacji]] - emoji-like graphics - as a way to react to posts.
* ( need screenshot )

=== Unsubscribe Confirmation Page ===
If you receive an email from "noreply@path.com", it likely has a line like: <blockquote>If you do not wish to receive these emails, <u>click here</u> to unsubscribe.</blockquote>
If you click the "click here" link, you get the following semi clever confirmation screen:

Filled rectangle used to redact email address.

The blue and red segments are actually animated, as if they're lightcycles from a birds eye view.

Reloading the page restarts the animation.

== Mobile UI ==
Screenshots that {{JackyAlcine}} took before the Android application went out of commission.

=== Action Selection ===
Path allowed for a quick access menu to select what kind of [[post]] the user'd like to make.

=== Media Selection ===
Path had a selection tool for picking something to watch or listen to.

=== Personalized User Stream ===
The main stream folded in all of the activities of all of the people that one was friends with in real time.
