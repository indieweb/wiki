'''<dfn>[https://path.com Path]</dfn>''' is a content hosting [[silo]] for private sharing of information among a small (limit 150) group of friends.

== UI ==
Random bits of UI from Path.com.
=== Limited Reacji ===
Path was perhaps the first content silo to expand beyond [[like]] to a limited set of [[reacji]] - emoji-like graphics - as a way to react to posts.
* ( need screenshot )

=== Unsubscribe Confirmation Page ===
If you receive an email from "noreply@path.com", it likely has a line like: <blockquote>If you do not wish to receive these emails, <u>click here</u> to unsubscribe.</blockquote>
If you click the "click here" link, you get the following semi clever confirmation screen:

[[File:2014-05-21-path-unsubscribe.png]]

Filled rectangle used to redact email address.

The blue and red segments are actually animated, as if they're lightcycles from a birds eye view.

Reloading the page restarts the animation.
