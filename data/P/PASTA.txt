{{stub}}

'''<dfn>PASTA</dfn>''' is an acronym/abbreviation for Publish Anywhere, Save To ([[private]]) [[archival copy|Archive]], the practice of automatically saving a copy of whatever you post on (social media) [[silo]]s to someplace else under your own control, like a private directory on your own server, or a local folder on your laptop that is less vulnerable to [[site-death]].

PASTA can be one way of building up a local export that eventually you can use to [[backfill]] to your own site.

PASTA is not syndication, so it is not just [[PESOS]] to a private archive. The archived copies of the post are not published, but only accessible for the owner of the archive. Thus, in case of a [[site-death]], the public copy is still lost for other people.

PASTA also does not apply when storing information directly in an archive, like [[GPS logging]] or making private [[bookmarks]], because the information was not public in the first place and has never been published.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} uses [[Camlistore]] as a personal archive for:
* posts from [[Twitter]]
* checkins from [[Swarm]] (and old checkins from [[Foursquare]])
* bookmarks from [[Pinboard]]
* photos from [[Flickr]]

Camlistore provides importers that use each services' API to gather and store the post data for his main account on that service.

He also uses [[OwnYourSwarm]] to [[PESOS]] Swarm checkins, and often POSSEs his Twitter posts, but this archive ensures that he has a personal backup copy of these posts.

=== Chris Aldrich === 
{{chrisaldrich}} keeps a variety of private posts (usually password protected) on the back end of his [[WordPress]] site as a personal archive for a variety of uses. As an example of a site-death causing an issue, he'd written an article for the AltPlatform.org site which closed down in 2017-12. Following the shutdown of AltPlatform, he was able to restore the public nature of the content by [http://boffosocko.com/2017/07/28/an-introduction-to-the-indieweb/ changing it from private to public on his personal site].

=== Peter Molnar ===
{{ petermolnar }} saves copies of favoured, liked, bookmarked. etc content, either via:
* [[Wallabag]] (bookmarks)
* [https://github.com/petermolnar/silo.pasta/ silo.PASTA], a set of Python scripts pulling faved & liked content from various silos (with some extra bits of magic)
