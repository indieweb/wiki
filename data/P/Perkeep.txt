== Issues ==
* Though not an officially supported Google project, contributors must sign Google's Contributor License Agreement [http://camlistore.org/code#contributing]. This is an explicit copyright and patent ''license'', not an ''assignment'' of ownership; contributors still retain full ownership of their contributions. Nevertheless, some open source developers object to CLAs in general. More information on Google's CLA can be found at [https://cla.developers.google.com/about cla.developers.google.com] and [https://opensource.google.com/docs/cla/ opensource.google.com].
