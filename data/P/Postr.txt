'''<dfn>[https://postr.dev Postr]</dfn>''' is a open source IndieWeb backend for [[node.js]] developed by {{grantcodes}}

== Usage ==
Currently being used to run the following sites:
* [https://grant.codes grant.codes] â€“ eating his own cooking

== Functionality ==

=== Database ===
* Posts are stored as [[microformats2]] json
* Uses [https://rxdb.info RxDB] as an extendible database
* Supports real time replication, both to [[couchdb]] compatible servers and clientside databases

=== [[Micropub]] ===
* The <code>@postr/core</code> package provides a fully functional micropub endpoint, with support for: posting, media, updates, deletes, undeletes, queries and more

=== Clientside Support ===

Postr is built in an isomorphic fashion, meaning it can also be run clientside. A lot of functionality is not possible clientside (such as the micropub endpoint) but there the database containing your posts / content can be fully replicated to the client and the same api used to query the database on the frontend and backend.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* Plain text posts will be parsed for [[markdown]]
* Mf2 posts are automatically validated
* References to external media files are automatically copied locally
* Photos can be automatically resized for thumbnails etc.
* Slugs are automatically generated from the post name / content

=== Glitch support ===

Postr can run on [[Glitch]], although not everything may be supported due to the limited nature of glitch hosting.

A basic example site can be found and remixed at [http://postr.glitch.me/ postr.glitch.me]

== Plugins ==

Postr is highly extendible, plugins can be used to modify data in the database, provide express endpoints and pretty much whatever else you could want.

<code>@postr/plugin</code> is the base plugin class, plugins can extend this and then be dropped into any postr instance.

=== [[Webmention]] Endpoint ===

<code>@postr/plugin-webmention-endpoint</code> provides a webmention endpoint that plugs directly into the post storage and will update posts when they receive a webmention.

=== Syndication ===

<code>@postr/syndicator</code> is a base plugin, designed to be extended to create syndication plugins.


==== [[Instagram]] ====

<code>@postr/syndicator-instagram</code> supports syndicating photos, likes and reposts to instagram.

==== [[Superfeedr]] ====

<code>@postr/syndicator-superfeedr</code> notifies superfeedr of new posts

==== [[Twitter]] ====

<code>@postr/syndicator-twitter</code> supports syndicating to twitter

=== Feeds ===

There is a feeds plugin in development that will enable content to be automatically output in different feed formats.

=== Planned Plugins ===

There are a number of other planned plugins, with the goal of making postr a fully functional IndieWeb backend:

* Importer to import your content from somewhere else
* Backup to automatically backup your content
* Token endpoint
* Webhook plugin to send webhooks that could trigger site build or send notifications
* Auth endpoint
