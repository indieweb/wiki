'''<dfn>[https://www.pscp.tv/ Periscope]</dfn>''' is a live streaming [[video]] [[silo]] service and app that was purchased by [[Twitter]] on 2015-03-13.

Originally videos published to the platform disappeared 24 hours after they were posted. In [https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11595244/how-to-save-periscopes-live-streams May 2016] it became possible to save videos to the platform longer than the 24 hour period.

== Saving Video ==
According to the [https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-live Twitter Help page], recording directly within Twitter:
<blockquote>Your live videos will automatically be posted as a Tweet each time you go live. Additionally, you can save your live video right to your deviceâ€™s camera roll at the end of your live video by tapping Save to camera roll. If you would like to upload and share your video at a later time, read how to share and watch videos on Twitter.</blockquote>
