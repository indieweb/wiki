'''<dfn>Progressive Web App</dfn>''' (PWA) is a web site that a client can progressively enhance into a standalone app that's comparable with a native app. 

Built on the basis of good adherence to modern web standards and technologies; they are platform independent, can be accessed through a URL, accessible and indexed by search engines.

A typical PWA will usually have included a high proportion of the following features and capabilities:

* Load over [[HTTPS]]
* Load over offline/poor performing network conditions (typically with a [[service worker]] script)
* Prompt user to Add to Homescreen
* Have a design that's mobile friendly
* The web site is progressively enhanced
* Optimised assets and requests, sometimes including delivery over [[HTTP2]]
* Provide enhanced accessibility features such as using ARIA attributes
