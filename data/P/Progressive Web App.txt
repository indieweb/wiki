'''<dfn>Progressive Web App</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn><abbr>PWA</abbr></dfn>) is a [[web app]] or web site that supports a particular list of technologies; there are a couple of examples of personal sites that support these technologies.

Built on the basis of good adherence to modern web standards and technologies; they are platform independent, can be accessed through a URL, accessible and indexed by search engines.

A typical PWA will usually have included a high proportion of the following features and capabilities:

* Load over [[HTTPS]]
* Load over offline/poor performing network conditions (typically with a [[service worker]] script)
* Prompt user to Add to Homescreen
* Have a design that's mobile friendly
* The web site is progressively enhanced
* Optimised assets and requests, sometimes including delivery over [[HTTP2]]
* Provide enhanced accessibility features such as using ARIA attributes

== Why ==
"PWA" is a buzzword that has been heavily marketed by a couple of big tech companies.

== Why not ==
If your site has application-like features, then (just) make it a [[web app]].

Instead of jumping on the PWA bandwagon, assess what user features and benefits you want to add to your personal website one by one, and then use [[progressive enhancement]] techniques to do so instead of someone else's technology checklist.

== Quickstart ==

The below code is a quickstart for creating a PWA manifest for a social reader called Monocle:

<pre>
{
    "name": "Monocle",
    "short_name": "Monocle",
    "description": "An IndieWeb Reader",
    "icons": [
        {
            "src": "/icons/android-chrome-192x192.png",
            "sizes": "192x192",
            "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
            "src": "/icons/android-chrome-512x512.png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "type": "image/png"
        }
    ],
    "id": "/?source=pwa",
    "start_url": "/?source=pwa",
    "background_color": "#fff",
    "display": "standalone",
    "scope": "/",
    "theme_color": "#fff"
}
</pre>

Notes:

* <code>start_url</code> is the URL that will first open when someone creates the PWA.
* <code>"display": "standalone"</code> tells a device to display the PWA as a standalone application instead of being wrapped in the browser.
