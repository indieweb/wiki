{{stub}}

'''<dfn>POSER</dfn>''' is a completely made-up acronym for Post On Socials Essentially Rants, a tongue-in-cheek mockery of the unfortunately common practice of posting rants on social media [[silos]], often hand-wringing about [[social media]] itself or BigTech or others, without taking the time to setup and use a personal site instead.
