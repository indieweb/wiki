{{stub}}

'''<dfn>POSER</dfn>''' is a completely made-up acronym for Post On Socials Essentially Rants, a tongue-in-cheek mockery of the unfortunately common practice of posting rants on social media [[silos]], hand-wringing about centralization or [[social media]] itself, often claiming expertise in decentralization, without taking the time to setup and use an independent personal site instead.
