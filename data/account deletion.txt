    '''<dfn>account deletion</dfn>''' is a common feature on [[silos]] and other services that allows a user to request that their account and information on the service be deleted and closed. Sometimes these requests come from outside the service itself, like https://twitter.com/mdvfunes/status/793771622847176704.
