* [[User: Www.kryogenix.org|Stuart Langridge]] uses it for his blog, and wrote about [http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/11/29/enabling-webmentions/ enabling webmentions] for it.
* {{bear}} used it from [https://bear.im/bearlog/2013/303/moved-back-to-a-static-site 2013-10-30] before deciding to write [[Hakkan]] instead.
** [https://bear.im/bearlog/2014/354/2015-01-01-indieweb-commitment 2014-12-20]: "planning on [...] getting a micropub endpoint setup so I can post notes and articles to my site without having to go thru the 7 manual steps I have to do now."
** [https://bear.im/bearlog/2014/012/the-yak-needed-shaving Switched to his own code] 2014-01-12: "The generation is done by reading markdown files and using Jinja2 templates to build html pages. Yes, this is all just like what Pelican was doing, but I needed to do some custom processes for the IndieWeb work that is in place and being planned."
** [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-04-17#t1429333153104 2015-04-17]: "some of the assumptions pelican had were making me crazy [but] they have all been fixed now [...] it has a very structured feel to how things work - and within that structure the plugins and themes are very good"
* [[User:Rabbit.withknown.com|Bridget Harrison]] uses it for http://bridgetharrison.org with a modified theme providing basic [[h-card]] and [[rel-me]] markup, https://github.com/mlncn/Flex
