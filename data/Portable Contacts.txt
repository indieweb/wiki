{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://portablecontacts.net/ Portable Contacts]</dfn>''' (often abbreviated as <abbr>PoCo</abbr>) is a proposed 2008 specification for exchange of contact info that uses a one-off [[JSON]] format.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no known IndieWeb sites publishing or consuming PoCo.

IndieWeb sites are alternatively publishing [[h-card]] (and [[hCard]]). 

Using a [[microformats2]] parser, you can get a canonical [[JSON]] representation of [[h-card]] contact information.
