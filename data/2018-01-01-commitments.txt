'''<dfn>2018-01-01-commitments</dfn>''' are implementation and launch commitments publicly made by the IndieWeb community to ship on their personal sites by 2018-01-01 00:00 local time.

== Commitments ==
In order of public declaration:

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}}
* [http://boffosocko.com/2017/10/20/indieweb-the-book/ 2017-10-20] Write a ~60,000 word draft of a [[generations|Gen2+]] oriented (text)book tentatively entitled ''IndieWeb for Everyone''.

=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{martijnvdven}}
* Basically copying [[2017-01-01-commitments#Martijn_van_der_Ven|last yearâ€™s failed commitment]]: all posting to licit.li will be done through Micropub starting in the new year.
** '''Progress 2017-12-27.''' A demo Micropub endpoint that allows anyone to post to it got launched. This will be made into the licit.li blog, thus also enabling things like software posting from their own identities or even guest posts!
* ðŸ—™ Together with the above, there will also be a [[token-endpoint|token endpoint]] implementation for vanderven.se/martijn/ to enable Micropub.
** '''Cancelled 2017-12-27.''' I see no value in adding a token endpoint to vanderven.se. Tokens are important to Micropub servers to check access and give clients long-lasting access. A token endpoint will be rollwed into licit.li for posting instead.
* âœ… Update everything to run on PHP 7.2.
** '''Done.''' Everything on vanderven.se, zegnat.net, and licit.li is running on PHP 7.2.
* âœ… Enhance [[XRay]] to extract information from [[YouTube]].
** '''Done 2017-12-27.''' Announced [https://twitter.com/martijnvdven/status/945994098577739777 on Twitter] and published [https://github.com/Zegnat/XRay/tree/youtube on GitHub].

=== Mark Dain ===
{{ancarda}}

* <del>Publish the first version of the blog software (and thus be able to publish some blog posts) that I'm writing on my website, https://markdain.net/</del> (Done '''2017-12-26''')
* Create an initial WebMention endpoint (that logs/archives all received WebMentions for processing at a later date).

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}}
* 2017-11-26 [https://martymcgui.re/2017/11/26/162135/ 2018-01-01 commitments]
** Before 2018-01-01 - Finish a plumbing upgrade on his site to replace a slow [[Jekyll]] configuration reliant on heavy plugin logic with a [[Hugo]] configuration plus some micro-services that run asynchronously. The goal is to reduce posting friction by increasing speed, and to do more via micropub, work which others can potentially (re-)use.
** In 2018 - Plan and host the first [[2018/Baltimore|IndieWebCamp Baltimore]]!

=== Jonathan Prozzi ===

** Before 2018-01-01: Mixture of technical and non-technical goals for his site. For example, want to change WordPress development environment to include Git. Has goal of writing 3 articles as well.
