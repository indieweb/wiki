== Commitments ==
In order of public declaration:

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}}
* [http://boffosocko.com/2017/10/20/indieweb-the-book/ 2017-10-20] Write a ~60,000 word draft of a [[generations|Gen2+]] oriented (text)book tentatively entitled ''IndieWeb for Everyone''.

=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{martijnvdven}}
* ‚ùå Basically copying [[2017-01-01-commitments#Martijn_van_der_Ven|last year‚Äôs failed commitment]]: all posting to licit.li will be done through [[Micropub]] starting in the new year.
** '''Progress 2017-12-27.''' [[Sink]] launched, a demo Micropub endpoint that allows anyone to post to it. This will be made into the licit.li blog, thus also enabling things like software posting from their own identities or even guest posts!
** '''Failed 2018-01-01T00:00:00.001+01:00.''' Where [[Sink]] is cutting corners on [[IndieAuth]], I did not want to launch a possibly-not-completely-secure back-end to licit.li. Postponed. Let‚Äôs not make it [[2019-01-01-commitments|2019-01-01]] though.
* üóô Together with the above, there will also be a [[token-endpoint|token endpoint]] implementation for vanderven.se/martijn/ to enable Micropub.
** '''Cancelled 2017-12-27.''' I see no value in adding a token endpoint to vanderven.se. Tokens are important to Micropub servers to check access and give clients long-lasting access. A token endpoint will be rolled into licit.li for posting instead.
* ‚úÖ Update everything to run on PHP 7.2.
** '''Done.''' Everything on vanderven.se, zegnat.net, and licit.li is running on PHP 7.2.
* ‚úÖ Enhance [[XRay]] to extract information from [[YouTube]].
** '''Done 2017-12-27.''' Announced [https://twitter.com/martijnvdven/status/945994098577739777 on Twitter] and published [https://github.com/Zegnat/XRay/tree/youtube on GitHub].

=== Mark Dain ===
{{ancarda}}

* <del>Publish the first version of the blog software (and thus be able to publish some blog posts) that I'm writing on my website, https://markdain.net/</del> (Done '''2017-12-26''')
* Create an initial WebMention endpoint (that logs/archives all received WebMentions for processing at a later date).

* 2017-11-26 [https://martymcgui.re/2017/11/26/162135/ 2018-01-01 commitments]
** Before 2018-01-01 - Finish a plumbing upgrade on his site to replace a slow [[Jekyll]] configuration reliant on heavy plugin logic with a [[Hugo]] configuration plus some micro-services that run asynchronously. The goal is to reduce posting friction by increasing speed, and to do more via micropub, work which others can potentially (re-)use.
** In 2018 - Plan and host the first [[2018/Baltimore|IndieWebCamp Baltimore]]!

* 2017-12-31 https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieauth/pull/9 - Completely rewrote the WordPress IndieAuth plugin, which had only had maintenance changes since 2013, and added new functionality...allows setting any arbitrary IndieAuth server. Updates to compliant with current iteration of specification. Adds support for logging into a WordPress site using an IndieAuth authorization endpoint, but authenticating yourself to a WordPress site using an IndieAuth Bearer Token. 
* 2017-12-31 https://github.com/snarfed/wordpress-micropub/commit/21170938a851df7cae69ed7a20b9b1f4742ba5d3 - Contributed enough PRs to {{snarfed}} that he accepted to get a new version of the WordPress Micropub plugin out the door before 2018.
