<cite><b>Chapter 16</b> <blockquote>Amber smiles and laughs. “I love it. Even the employees of the Evil Empire are peeling away to join the Rebel Alliance.” She takes a bite, then continues. “IndieWeb is about returning the web to what it was before—a bunch of home-brew websites. People create content, they should own that content. Too many companies went out of business and lost all of their users’ data.”</blockquote></cite>
