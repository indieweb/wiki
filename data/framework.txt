A '''<dfn>framework</dfn>''' (in this context <dfn>software framework</dfn> or <dfn>web framework</dfn> in particular) is a software [[library]] and ways of using it that provides an alternative (often simplified) way of writing software, typically explicitly instead of how you would normally write that software.

If a [[library]] provides different (even simplified) ways of writing software, but explicitly adjacent to, complementary with, or even dependent on how you would normally write that software, then it is not typically considered a framework.
