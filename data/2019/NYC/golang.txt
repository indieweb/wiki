== Notes ==
* fairly consistent experience
* http server 
* golang.org to download and install 
* runs on linux,mac and windows (others as well)
* after installing need to use two more tools - terminal and text/code editor
* when in the terminal you can type in 'ls' to see the directories
* when you type 'pwd' you can see what directory you are currently in
* use mkdir 'some name' to create a new directory 
* type 'pwd' again to confirm that you are in your new directory 
* then type 'go version' to see if it is installed 
* go code will be done in text 
* create a new file in text editor and name it 'main.go'
* go file will always have the following 3 parts - a package (and its name) , import statements , your code 
* need to write a function called main - this is where everything will start
* to declare a function you need to write 'func' and the name ex : <code>func main' ( ) { }</code>
** code will go in the { }
* put spaces between the { } 
* go back to the terminal - need to come up with an import path 
* go supports custom import paths 
* in the terminal to create the import path you will need to type 'go mod init <website>/<project name>' e.g. <code>go mod init first.last.com/mygoproject</code>
* it should say ' creating new go module' 
* command <code>go run .</code>( this will run the command in the current working directory) 
* go to 'godoc.org/net/http' we will scroll down to look at an example for a web server
* put this into your code within the { } : <code>{ func main ( ) { http.HandleFunc("/bar", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {         fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %q", html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path)) })  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)) }</code>
* now we need to import --->  under package main put 'import "net/http" ', 'import "log"',   'import "fmt" ', ' import "html"'
