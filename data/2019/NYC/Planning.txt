Venues:
* Dead Rabbit (where we held the [[2018/NYC]] preparty)
** +0 {{t}} was ok last year, would prefer a new spot this year, though ok with this as a fallback
** {{addyourself}}
* Tom & Jerry's — has a back table which can be reserved and can informally bring in outside food (per [https://foursquare.com/v/tom--jerrys/3fd66200f964a52038eb1ee3 Foursquare tips])
** +1 {{t}} went here ages ago and it had a great atmosphere. Also a classic hangout during the Web 2.0 days so it may very well attract the crowd that remembers when blogging was more of a thing before social media. E.g. [https://twitter.com/LaurenGoode/status/1161015658110283776 @LaurenGoode August 12, 2019]:<blockquote>"This feels like news from an era when everyone would have gone to Tom & Jerry's to celebrate afterwards https://twitter.com/verge/status/1161013910964789250" <blockquote>"Verizon is selling Tumblr to WordPress’ owner https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802639/tumblr-verizon-sold-wordpress-blogging-yahoo-adult-content"</blockquote></blockquote>
