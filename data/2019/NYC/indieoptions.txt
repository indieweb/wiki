== Notes ==
There is a so much choice out there whether you use a CMS, Static Site Generator, roll your own
*Static Site Generator - you have to write the content and use a website; you're serving a flat file 

[[cms|CMS choices]]

* Options with open protocols and open APIs
* No code option
**Micro.blog --> it's a service
*** All building blocks work: specific tools that connect to each other (e.g., indieauth , webmentions) 
*** Hugo site - you can type in html or Markdown
*** $5/mo or $10/mo if you want a podcast
*** Good community
*** Connects to Tumblr, Medium, Wordpress, Mastodon
*** Do things with IG where you can own your gram 
*** One button install 
*** Not open source
*** Takes minutes to learn and years to master; it's not open-source but open garden

* Options that are ready-to-go platforms and services

** has an install tax - 

* Wordpress.org - 35-40% of the web 
** +/- So customizable but you can get lost with all of the plug-ins 
** +/- 
** Requires hosting -> need to pay for  shared host 

* GitHub pages
** below No and Wordpress.org because you're mainly just writing in html 
**- You have to touch code
**+ Free
