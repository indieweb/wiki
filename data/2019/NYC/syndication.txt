== Notes ==
Three ways of doing things: 
* [[POSSE]]: Community-wise, we beileve that we should post on our own website and then syndicate to others for more control; microblog can do this for you, you have microblog pulling your feed, it goes into twitter, fb pages; it's cross-posting
* [[PESOS]]: Or post elsewhere, and pull into your website: 
* Manual until it hurts

[[Bridgy]]: More DIY - when your post goes up, you have to tell them which to follow
Micro.blog: syndication is included if you're already paying for an account; but if you already have your website, then you can syndicate there for a different fee
