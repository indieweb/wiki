Session: Groups<br>

== Participants ==
* {{jacky}} (facilitator)
* {{eddiehinkle}}
* {{grantcodes}}
* {{aaronpk}}
* {{chrisaldrich}} - listening in and taking some notes

== Notes ==
* A group could be "public" or "private".

* Facebook Group conversin thoughts
** Group Members

* A way to send a private webmention to multiple people without having to remember who all is on the list.

Silo groups:
     * [[Facebook]]
     * [[Instagram]]
     * [[Telegram]]
     * [[Google+]] (circles) (R.I.P.)

Different definitions of a group:
    1. A simple list of people that you want to publish to / mention (one way interaction). Normally the publisher contols who is included. This sounds kind of similar to a mailing list.
    2. A forum / chat style with interaction between the members. Normally members can join and leave at will
    3. [[Twitter]] lists - via hashtags - impromptu groups using [[tags]]
** Has no concept of joining or leaving
** How to make a discoverable list of participants (if the group is private)?

* IndieNews is a public group, anyone can send a post to it and people can subscribe to it (it has an [[h-feed]])
** {{aaronpk}} I just updated IndieNews to list out members of the group https://news.indieweb.org/en/members
* A private group could be a private thing like IndieNews. If you have something like AutoAuth, you can be invited and added to a group that could then only accept posts from existing members.
* People can subscribe to posts on this group in their reader.

Technorati did large scale [[discovery]] via [[tags]].
