== Participants ==
* {{gRegor}} (session facilitator)
* {{chrisaldrich}}
* {{dougbeal}}
* {{jgmac1106}}
* {{eddiehinkle}}

== Notes ==
{{gRegor}} has opensourced [[indiebookclub]]

WorldCat or OpenLibrary for opensource book covers

At Austin discussion of micropub, he started thinking about an OwnYourReads type service

{{chrisaldrich}} is consuming the [[Goodreads]] RSS feed in his backend, occasionally posts to his own site
* RSS feed has title authors, tiny thumbnail

[[silo.pub]] has been down

{{dougbeal}} uses Kindle which pushes information into Goodreads
* star rating and review at finish reading, gives option to syndicate to Goodreads

Highlighted or annotated pieces in Kindle, Goodreads picks it up as a private [[annotation]], gives option to make it public.
* {{chrisaldrich}} has it on his list to check if there's an RSS / export for this

TODO for gregor: 
* âœ” add github / contact info to indiebookclub.biz
* check on micro.blog usage numbers

[[PESOS]] options for read posts?
* [[Bridgy]]
* [[silo.pub]]

* {{eddiehinkle}} uses Kindle a lot so Goodreads -> Micropub is an ideal use-case. The friction of typing a quote from a book is too great for me. lol.

Amazon Kindle app on Android lets you highlight text and share to any app source
