Can you choose what to display on Mastodon/ActiviyPub profiles?

Profile pages as a service:
* carrd.co
* about.me

https://whereisfelix.today

Passive / active updates:
* Depends on the data you show
* Something like current location / mood would update a lot, but your name is probably not going to change much

Different styles of profiles:
* long articles
* dashboard style with various statuses (current location, last watched, projects etc...)
* Single about me sentence
