=== Notes ===

Eddie has recently updated his homepage to include more of a profile.

Grant thinking of who.is.grant.codes

Canonical h-cards are a thing

https://github.com/github/personal-website is a github repo that can be forked to create a basic profile site (example: https://0sk4r.github.io/ )

Can you choose what to display on Mastodon/ActiviyPub profiles?

Profile pages as a service:
* carrd.co
* about.me

https://whereisfelix.today

Passive / active updates:
* Depends on the data you show
* Something like current location / mood would update a lot, but your name is probably not going to change much
    
https://vanderven.se/martijn/

Different styles of profiles:
* long articles
* dashboard style with various statuses (current location, last watched, projects etc...)
* Single about me sentence

== IndieWebCamp [[2019/Online|Online 2019]]: Session: Profile Pages Part 2 ==
When: 2019-03-09 16:00 UTC

=== Participants ===
* {{eddiehinkle}}
* {{jgmac1106}}
* {{martijnvdven}}
* {{rose}}

=== Notes ===
* What is the difference between profile and about me?
** Who you are and What you are doing are often two different use cases
** Eddie likes About pages but not in the palce of a profile page. I see them as two different thins
*** About history of you
*** Profile (I am married, but about me I was single)
*** Profile = currency and About Me = History

=== Examples ===
* {{jgmac1106}}
** https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/profile/jgmac1106
** https://jgregorymcverry.com/aboutme.html
* https://chriscoyier.net
** Choose the length of bio and the writing style
* https://adactio.com/about/myself/
** Do you have a program/speaker blurb or is the about page used for that?
* {{eddiehinkle}} is turning his homepage into a profile
* {{martijnvdven}} isn't sure how to add more "about" blurb text
* {{jacky}} has a seperate press page
* {{rose}} would like it to be her homepage
** https://jacky.wtf/press/
** http://kevo.glass/aboutme.html
*** Going to break up into details and summary
*** wonders if I can seperate them into different grid cells left and right and not just verticallly..
* Postmark App changes the profile photo every time you load the person's page
** https://postmarkapp.com/
* Based on the referrer
** If they come from a search engine introduce yourself
** If they come from a friend's website (say aaronpk.com), explain how you know that person (Aaron) and show some interesting posts that they might like if they liked Aaron's posts.
* Looking at Facebook Profiles they have some interesting things
** They have a stats area in the top left
** They have 9 recent photos
** 9 friends that might be in common
** 6 "did you know" questions that they have answered that you might find interesting.
