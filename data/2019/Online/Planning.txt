=== Goals / Ideas for Online Medium ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-08#t1541705550957900 posted a long winded speech] about various ideas for IWC Online. Here are some points:
* We were thinking about it being a melding of synchronous and asynchronous.
* Intros and Demos should be synchronous with everyone together in a single chat room.
* Instead of having a "time-block" of say 4 hours where all the sessions take place, propose sessions and then people who are interested in the session can suggest times during a 1 day window, then the time that works for the most people becomes when that session happens.
* 

{{eddiehinkle.com}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-11#t1541947045313100 suggested] that we could have different "digital rooms" via Google Hangouts or whatever other streaming platform we use. This would allow for more collaboration among peers than you can get when everyone is in a single digital room. This could especially be useful during the projects time.

{{jgmac1106}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-08#t1541706795743500 proposed the idea] of having the ability for there to be multiple versions of the same topic in different timezones.

=== Possible physical locations using HWCs ===
{{jgmac1106}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-11#t1541946834988600 pointed out] that we could coordinate with Homebrew Website Clubs and IndieWeb Meetups that don't have a local IndieWebCamp to meet together during IWC Online.
