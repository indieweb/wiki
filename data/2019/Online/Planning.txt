=== Goals / Ideas for Online Medium ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-08#t1541705550957900 posted a long winded speech] about various ideas for IWC Online. Here are some points:
* We were thinking about it being a melding of synchronous and asynchronous.
* Intros and Demos should be synchronous with everyone together in a single chat room.
* Instead of having a "time-block" of say 4 hours where all the sessions take place, propose sessions and then people who are interested in the session can suggest times during a 1 day window, then the time that works for the most people becomes when that session happens.
* 

{{eddiehinkle.com}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-11#t1541947045313100 suggested] that we could have different "digital rooms" via Google Hangouts or whatever other streaming platform we use. This would allow for more collaboration among peers than you can get when everyone is in a single digital room. This could especially be useful during the projects time.

{{jgmac1106}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-08#t1541706795743500 proposed the idea] of having the ability for there to be multiple versions of the same topic in different timezones.

{{jgmac1006}} we should offer a "naptime" session where parents can suggest a time when they will be available based on nap schedules and that actual start times might be a bit squishy

=== Possible physical locations using HWCs ===
{{jgmac1106}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-11-11#t1541946834988600 pointed out] that we could coordinate with Homebrew Website Clubs and IndieWeb Meetups that don't have a local IndieWebCamp to meet together during IWC Online.

=== One way and two-way sessions ===
We may want to include one-way sessions with a Q=A at the

=== Examples of other online conferences ===

* https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/
* https://www.edtechteam.com/summits/the-virtual/

=== Include Lightning Round Research Talks ===
* Blogcon 2003-2006 used to have academics present on blogging research. Thinking of doing somethign similar at online where research is submitted for peer review and accepted sessions can do a remote lightning round to present their work.

*Probably not ready for March, but leaving idea here for future Online..still like idea of lightning round talks.

=== Schedule Proposal ===
* Day One: Pre-Camp Session-Focus on tutorials for people who want to join but may not be on chat, the wiki, have a website, need directions on etherpad or mediawiki markup
* Day Two (March 19): 
**Keynotes and Intros live, then asynchronous session proposals. If interest see if Australian/Pacific/Asian want a live session in their time slot. 
**Offer session slots in two timezones, really a session is gran a friend and an etherpad.
**People propose their sessions. Instead of traditional grid just have a 24 hour calendar and session organizers block out their hour. Session organizer chooses either auido {{mumble}} or video (use IndieWeb account and YouTube live, can have six simultaneous streams_
* Day Three (March 20)
**Hack day, Participants sign up for 5 hours over a the 24 hour period. Each hour timeslot has an associated trackpad. Do checkins at 30 intervals
**Need an agreed upon time for live demos. Each YouTube Live event can have ten participants, may want to due a cue. Having multiple streams with multiple guests is a bandwidth hog.
