Session: Events in Wordpress<br>

== Notes ==
There could be a couple of modes of attack on this:
* Adding events to the Post Kinds Plugin for WordPress
** {{GWG}} didn't build it in initially because Post Kinds used h-entry as its top level mark up and events should use h-event
* Adding microformats into one or more larger events/calendar plugins
** https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/ accepts PR and we could potentially add microformats into that (has 700,000+ users)

{{GWG}} is adding some code so that Events from [[Quill]] will work for display on WordPress. This should be a quick stopgap method for posting events to WordPress.
