== Notes ==
* {{mblaney}} notes it a bit depressing, as he needs to ask a lot from people...there is a reason why Twitter/Facebook just work, as they control all of it.
** Follow Post is u-follow-of
** Looks up author of the post...are you relying that the author links to their feed...
** https://unicyclic.com/indieweb/directory
* This is every sort of feed.
* People do not give names to their feeds. (but they could with a title attribute--see below)
* People do not give summaries or authors in their h-feeds for the most part if they are there should be parsed.
* Sites do not say what the feeds are programmatically. Like 'default' feed.

Follow posts vs follow page full of follow entries...

{{cleverdevil}} is going to add titles, summaries, and a script to generate a following feed. 

* {{chrisaldrich}} provides a hanful of "useful" big feeds, but doesn't provide *all* of his feeds as he's got one for every category, tag, and post kind on his site.
Here's an example of one of my feeds for discovery: <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Chris Aldrich » Linkblog Feed" href="https://boffosocko.com/linkblog.xml">
Couldn't we have microsub servers/clients pull the title attribute to provide some additional information about feeds?

* We agreed that a key place to improve the follow/discovery experience is to have Microsub servers and clients read more metadata off of feeds that are specified as <link rel=“feed”>
** It appears that Yarns reads at minimum the “title” property and presents it back in Microsub clients like Together

* https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-link-element <- attributes allowed on LINK elements
* http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values <- rel values

* Should microsub servers automatically create a follow post (via micropub)? Should it be optional?
* if follow posts have tags, then one could search the site for follow posts intersected with tags to find other interesting people to follow
  
Following posts are in part for the outward facing social signals.
Cleverdevil doesn't think that follow posts are worthwhile because of [[DRY]] principle
Or someone else might follow because they see that someone they follow follows that person.
And how could we rearchitect following lists (a la Twitter, or OPML)?

link rel="follows"?? as an indicator

Follows seem important to me for building networks

Comments have always been a useful means of discovery... when on a post, you could search for h-cards and feeds from them. If a microsub server could do that...
