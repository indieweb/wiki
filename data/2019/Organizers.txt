Tasks not done from [[2019/Berlin/Organizers]]:
* ...

Tasks not done from [[2018/Organizers#Task_List]]
* Document: jf2 spec is on indieweb, so makes sense for the code to live in same org as the spec - so we don't move it.
* CoC contacts: Leaders willing to be points of contact should add themselves (including local timezone) to [[code-of-conduct#Resolving_an_Issue]]
** Make sure your wiki user page has contact information as well
* reduce chat noise: {{aaronpk}} will make an incremental improvement, de-duping notifications by having them only go to the "more specific" channel. e.g. a tweet w/ #indieweb and #webmention would go to #indieweb-dev, not #indieweb.
* Finalize dates and venue in January 2019 for the next IWS to leave time for travel assistance applications, time for applicants to also apply for visas and book flights.
* {{aaronpk}}: reflect on retention from Day 1 to Day 2 on Tuesday => Wednesday compared to past dropouts on Sat/Sun.

== Summit 2019 Final Tasks ==
Originally: https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Organizers&oldid=62915#Summit_2019_Final_Tasks
https://indieweb.org/2019/Planning#To-do

Final planning details for Summit [[2019]].
* Volunteer assignments for Saturday
** Check-in list on iPad for attendance. {{gRegor}} (not paperless)
** we have a box of t-shirts! {{anomalily}} has volunteered to hand them out.
*** generic and womens styles in slightly different grays
** Help with badges / lanyards. {{tmiller}}
*** aaronpk printed up stickers so people don't have to write names. if they want a different name let them write on the badge in sharpie.
*** 4 colors - black (regular attendee, photos okay); yellow (regular attendee, ask before photo); red (regular attendee, no photos), purple (organizers/CoC contacts, photos okay)
**** purple: {{t}}, {{aaronpk}}, {{tmiller}} (CoC contacts)
*** remind attendees of Code of Conduct. {{aaronpk}} will print out of CoC copies for badge table. (and sign for lobby).

* [ ] Question: do we need to have someone running people up the elevators, of will building security do it? If building security does, until what time?
** [ ] {{t}} will ask Katt.
** as far as we know elevator will be locked starting at 10am. people that need to come and go during the day will need to contact aaronpk to get up the elevator. aaronpk will dispatch a mozillian to let people up.
*** we may have 4 Mozillians (including {{t}}, dbryant, Darius) with elevator badges.
*** particularly important for lunch on our own Saturday. need a Mozillan with building badge in the lobby starting 15 minutes before lunch is over (1:15pm). {{aaronpk}} is indicating this on the schedule.

Attendance Discussion:

* If someone shows up and is not on the list, what is the policy?
** {{t}} thinks we should tell them we're at capacity. Policy should be clear enough so volunteer is comfortable saying it. And we have done this in the past, e.g. [[2017]]
** One exception: Mozilla employees with badge. Direct them to check in with Tantek.
** if someone says they did register but aren't on the list (iPad), get {{aaronpk}}. (He has access to the ti.to and knows how to use it, e.g. to check for incomplete signups.)
** {{tmiller}} suggests we point anyone we turn away at the remote participation, since that has no cap or requirement
** {{gwg}} asks what about future events? {{t}}, {{aaronpk}}, others say it depends on the event and the organizers.

* rooms and breakouts
** Moz remodeled and we now have 3 rooms total (main and 2 breakouts) instead of 4.
** each breakout "actual room" currently has 5 chairs. {{t}} asked and those chairs will have to come from the main room. we'll move some during lunch so each room has 7.
*** some folks may have to stand.
** ✅ {{t}} will be trained in how to close the partitions in alameda, making two more spaces (green and blue)
*** kitchen (green)
*** tall tables by the checkin area (blue)
** [ ] {{aaronpk}} will make room signs (colored paper with IWC logo per room)
** [ ] {{aaronpk}} will also print facilitation papers (content from /2018/Baltimore is at https://martymcgui.re/2018/01/23/iwc-baltimore-2018--session-planning-planning/ )

* Zoom room volunteers
** we have 3 zoom accounts
** the room equipment can't actually host the zoom stream.
** [ ] {{aaronpk}} will provide an ipad for each room to actually host the meeting.
*** also controls what remote participants can do, mute people, etc.
** ✅ {{aaronpk}} will train people to set them up.
*** ipad has a personalized zoom URL. URLs on the remote participation page on the wiki.
*** moz media setup needs to dial in with a long numeric room ID. (should always be visible on the ipad that's running the meeting.)
*** all ipads should have camera and mic muted
**** [ ] {{aaronpk}} will have to find plugs to stop the ipads from making noise.
*** recording is automatic so don't try.
*** if someone wants to screen share into the meeting they will need to download zoom and join the meeting by ID.
**** mute yourself and screen share.
**** use ipad control to turn off shares. or kick griefers. (there is an account setting that can prevent kicked people from rejoining. we disabled this so they can rejoin. accidentally banned dougbeal during testing!)
** will start each ipad at the beginning of the day. {{aaronpk}} will post-process the videos after.
** [ ] {{aaronpk}} will add link to download zoom to the welcome email that goes out today to all remote people (and local people?).
** concerns about screensharing being automatically allowed, so griefers could share awful things
*** if this actually happens, {{aaronpk}} can log into the admin and totally disable screen share on each account.
*** can also shut down the screen via the Mozilla media controls in the room as a failsafe for local participants. remotes will have to do their own disabling.

* [ ] power? {{aaronpk}} will get last year's power strips from his garage.

* Opening morning media/video during welcome and check-in.
** {{gRegor}} will plug into HDMI in alameda (main room) for some mood music and video during checkin time.
** videos
*** [ ] TSN trailer (needs cropping) https://youtu.be/lB95KLmpLR4?t=7,53
*** [ ] Squarespace parody
*** [ ] Keanu videos

* Closing Announcements:
** Upcoming IndieWebCamps at 2019.indieweb.org
** dates and location locked in for 2020-06-27...28!
