* We're starting with [[Meetup]], it has problems. It costs money, they planned to start charging even more which has generated a lot of meetup. 
* [[Eventbrite]] is another solution, but is also not without its problems. 
* [[Open Collective]]
* [[Tito]]

The hosted solutions offer:
* Central hub for attendees
* Discovery of new meetups
* Communication between the community, attendees
* Easy contact with the organisers
* Paid tickets
* Capacity limitations and waiting list
* Calendar integration
* Notify about events

What we don't have with the hosted solutions:
* Spam protection (spam bots comment on events and it sent emails to everyone)
* Privacy 
    
IndieWeb has the events page - not ideal from an admin perspective

[[Calagator]] (https://calagator.org/) exists

We can use:
* http://microformats.org/wiki/h-event
* Eventbrite?
* ...

Meetup is easier to search than Google - you can filter for events at specific times.
