== Notes ==
The history of photo posting from https://itp.nyu.edu/adjacent/issue-6/the-evolving-exhibition-of-us-a-decade-of-sharing-pictures-online/
 
Shows 'Selfmade', which takes people and turns them into brands....insists that having a company edit your photos makes them more 'authentic'.

Major cities have 'pop up' experiences so you can post Instagram worthy photos. like the Ice Cream Museum in San Francisco

Tantek's history of posting photos
* https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/ (see oldest photos from 2005 when he started posting on Flickr)
* Tantek posts publicly only about 1% of the photos he actually takes. He takes photos at location and stores them in Foursquare.
* https://tantek.com/ photos today
* cross-posts to Instagram: https://instagram.com/tantek

geotagged photos in Instagram allow you to see photos from a location from others

Brainstorming: Idea for an indieweb service where you submit your site, and it will show geotagged or tagged images combined with other site members.

Why post photos?
* Did we post photos of ourselves / selfies 20 years ago?
** e.g. 15 years ago Flickr mirrorproject: https://flickr.com/search/?sort=date-posted-desc&safe_search=1&text=mirrorproject&view_all=1&min_taken_date=1072944000&max_taken_date=1167724799
* When you buy new gear, there's a feeling of needing to use it to take a bunch more photos. Posting depends on context, e.g. at a conference, then more get posted publicly.
* Greg: Because you want to
* ... lots more not recorded

When post photos?
* David posts later so he doesn't have to stop what he's doing. E.g. on the bus going somewhere, or back at his place of residence, or back at the hotel
* Toni: Tweet about a photo of something he likes just in time
* Tantek: similar to David, night of, or often many days later
* Toni: multiple images like a set, maybe end of the week
* Greg: Whenever you want
* ... lots more not recorded

To/for whom?
* Toni: Event photography
* Leslye: protect posts for my parents to know where I and get a glance of what I'm doing
* ... lots more not recorded
