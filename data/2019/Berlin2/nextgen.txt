== Notes ==
would be great to give teens a way to use their own words and views about indie web

How would you convince your friends?

the privacy angle or the archiving aspects of the indie web is interesting.

how is instagram used? To talk to your school friends? No, most of the friends are from outside

How would we get started right now? Microblog.

Have there been issues with video censorship on tiktok? 
* Only in the case that the videos broke the rules, such as someone smoking.
* This seems a little excessive? 

There doesn't seem to be a solid argument for why teens would move to indieweb

If someone famous moved to indieweb then there might be a migration

a lot of people make money using social media platforms
* in the case of youtube, many people were adversly affected by decisions made by youtube around the amount of money content creators earned from ad revenue
* this resulted in lots of youtubers using patreon.

There isn't something specific that indieweb could do for teens right now.
