'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Amsterdam 2019</dfn>''' is 28-29 September 2019, the first IndieWebCamp in [[Amsterdam]]!

<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness every year. But there is still a lot of work to do to help people to understand what the IndieWeb is and “owning your data” actually means at all. Besides the growth, there is also the need to start building bridges to other areas of interest where the IndieWeb principles can be of importance. To start connecting, building bridges, find the others and to help people getting started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Amsterdam for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, collaborating, teaching, helping and much more.
