== Session Ideas ==
* {{JackyAlcine}} '''Ephemeral Profiles for the IndieWeb'''. #EphemeralHcards
** I'd like this session to be about providing authorization to people without an IndieWeb-friendly site to one's site. The primary objective is to allow for access to [[private posts]] for those on [[silo|silos]] or other platforms.
** '''Recommended Reading''': [[AutoAuth]], [[private posts]]
* {{JameySharp}} '''Taking syndication beyond news and microblogs'''. IndieWeb tools cover use-cases like microblogging very well. But with a shift in perspective, much of the same technology could work for other applications. One use case which I care about is webcomics.
