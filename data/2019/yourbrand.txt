== Notes ==
* personal branding guidelines created by us all

created a list of things to consider
* what are your personal branding goals?
* branding is more than just a visual thing
* what are things you love to do and people you associate with
* may take experimentation and realizing you don't like something 
* it's a growth process
* should try a lot of things in order to filter out what you like and don't like
* not to worry about people falling off

* who are you?
* what is your specialty?
* Your [[audience]] most of the time will be you. What are you passionate about and where is the market at the same time.
* you get to define who you are and if you don't people will just guess. You can do this with content marketing, blogs, taking pictures.

do meetup groups
* attend or create
* anything you put out into the world is apart of your brand

* Costs involved $20/month
* Sometimes they can be heavily white/cis gender without actively pushing them to be balanced (especially when using meetup.com)
* the level of quality needs to be high (and that's part of your brand)

Used adventure.bike as an example case.
* tomas wants it to be a blog sharing bikepacking adventures. site shows off some good photography
* suggestion to add a call-to-action to read about the adventures. also, maybe add a suggestions section under each adventure blog post to keep people reading.
* kudos on having an About page, important to have a "who am i"/"who are we" page to build trust

using seperate accounts for your content/ideas
* have a clear focus 
* talk about what you care about 
* might want to partition accounts on silos if you cover topics with very different audiences.

q: how much "personality" to show in what you post?
* as you gain an audience they respect you more (so you have more freedom)

your branding is not always just sharing what you do. can/should also be a resource
* things you are learning / takeaways, even if brief.
* things you want to teach

q: re: about pages. on a personal website, should it be first-person "welcome to my website i wrote this"? some advice says third-person is more authoritative
* can be a mix. andi's example is third-person so she can copy-paste it into speaker bios
* example: chris coyier's expanding bio with radio buttons for first- and third-person, options for length, etc.

another way to help build your brand is to help other people and sharing experiences with other people 

logo design:
* what kind of asthetic do you like?
* so you can be clear and descirbe to a designer what you want and so you are aware of things you like
    
use pinterest (or similar) to help with inspiration
* gather up examples of things that you love.

speak in a clear and concise way 
* write carefully, clearly. edit. edit. edit. test it out with people.

multiple streams of content
* video
* photos
* audio (make a podcast; make a video version of the podcast!)
