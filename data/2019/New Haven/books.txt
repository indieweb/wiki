== Overview ==
A few people have books of either their own or those of others available online. Some may even be building OER (open educational resource) systems for distributing books related to teaching.
What is the best way to own them, display them, use them on one's own site? 
Let's discuss examples, UI, tools, methods, and related tidbits to flesh out the /book page on the wiki to jumpstart additional research and work into the area.

== Notes ==
Author platforms - general term for author websites for promoting their books and writing

    * Most publishers want authors to have them for publicity

    * IndieWeb could be an excellent way to build such sites, particularly for cross-platform conversations expecially with [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]]

    ** Fewer places to check and maintain

    ** Makes posting and maintining content a lot more [[DRY]]



== Goals ==
There are a variety of goals one may have with relation to books and the IndieWeb:
* Displaying collections of books
* Authors publishing books
* Authors marketing books
* Authors playing books
* Authors selling books (see ecommerce / [[IndieWeb for business]])


Brainstorming session to get an overview of some of the process, workflow, and current tools

== Book writing/editing software ==
* [[Github]] - multiple users and version control
* [https://www.overleaf.com/ Overleaf] - an online LaTeX editor
** some features require a paid account
* [https://quip.com/ Quip]
* Google Docs 
** Example of Open Pedagogy book: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4bnEbX-nqloNUxoa0pGdnczR0U?usp=sharing
** comments
** tasks
** revision history
* [https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview Scrivener]
** does epub, mobi, 
* [[Wiki|Wikis]]
** [[MediaWiki]] - potential issue of plugins
* [[Calibre]] - like the iTunes of books for document management
** Will do file conversion from one format to another reasonably well
* [https://sigil-ebook.com/ Sigil - for ebook epub document editing
* [https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence Confluence] (from Atlassian the owners of Jira, Bitbucket, etc.)
* [https://pandoc.org/ Pandoc]- convert between document formats
* MediaCommons.org
* [https://pressbooks.com/pressbooks-open-source-plugin/ Pressbooks] - built on multi-site WordPress installation
** Pressbooks is a GPL-licensed plugin that transforms a WordPress Multi-Site install into a book production Content Management System, which exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready PDF*, and various XML flavours.

=== What we're looking for in an editor generally ===
editing
collaborating
spell check
grammar check
backup
[[accessibility]]

General advice
* Don't edit in your CMS so you don't loose work or it doesn't get backed up


== Distribution Sites/Silos ==
* [https://books.google.com/ Google books]
* [https://www.gutenberg.org/ Project Gutenberg]
* [https://archive.org/details/texts Archive.org books] - The Internet Archive offers over 15,000,000 freely downloadable books and texts. There is also a collection of 550,000 modern eBooks that may be borrowed by anyone with a free archive.org account.
* [https://www.createspace.com/ CreateSpace]
* Zombie book platform - notes TK
* [https://www.wattpad.com/ Wattpad]
* Fanfic sites
** ???


== Sales sites & silos ==
* Amazon
* Alibris
* Smashwords
* Others...

[[Woo Commerce]]
* payment gateways like Stripe/Paypall
* invoice ninja


Big problem: writing and distributing books in a [[DRY]] way from start to finish
* It would be nice to do all of these pieces on a single website in a simple way

NaNoWriMo

* dana boyd has pdfs on her website which are downloadable for free
* how does Corey Doctorow distribute books on his site
** He gives the product away and has indicated in the past that this actually helps with discovery as well as to drive longer term sales.

[[Patreon]] model of writing and using a subscription model of $x per month as the book is written
* Doug Belshaw is apparently using this sort of model


== Publicity sites / silos ==
* LibraryThing
* [[Goodreads]]
* NetGalley
* Edelweiss
