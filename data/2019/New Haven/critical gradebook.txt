https://haxtheweb.org/ - for headless posting (not too dissimilar to the micropub idea

* many of us use RSS readers as gradebooks
** set up filters ans encourage tagging
** learning how to tag is often "one more thing" and students in general are not great at tagging

* Can we use microformat parsers as a gradebook?
** How do you build dashboards to tabulate post from a feed

* Webmention feedback loop
** reflection drives learning
** {{jgmac1106}} uses webmentions for positive praise and native comments (students do not approve the comments) for sending growth statements.

* Can you use HTML Parsers
** {{jgmac1106}} idea score series of posts on some quality scale
*** see what frequency of HTML elements best predict quality
*** Develop smart tutorial chatbots around those areas
*** Develop growth curve models
