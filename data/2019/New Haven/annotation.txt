[[Hypothes.is]] can be used to create:
* [[reply|replies]]
* [[annotations]]
* [[highlights]]
* [[bookmark]]s - by creating "page notes" with [[tag|tags]]
* [[read]] posts - it's implicit for highlights or annotations that at least those portions were read, while the presumption with multiple highlights and annotations on a page indicates more than just a reading, but a close reading of a page.
* One could technically use it as a blogging platform, but the "blog" would live on other's websites while the Hypothes.is UI would still provide a reverse chronological presentation that also includes an RSS feed

Hypothes.is has two different canonical presentations with slightly varying URL patterns:
Examples:
* https://hyp.is/FJnGaEWxEemE0KeGm6_zwA - shows the highlight/annotation in situ on the original page
* https://hypothes.is/a/FJnGaEWxEemE0KeGm6_zwA - shows the highlight/annotation on its own free-standing page
** Ideally, this is the page that should have a link to the original URL for webmentions (it currently doesn't) as well as microformats markup to allow proper parsing.
** With proper mark up on these pages, one could manually force webmentions for sites that support them

There is a facet tool that will show all the highlights, annotations, and bookmarks that appear on a particular website from Hypothes.is:
* Example: https://jonudell.info/h/facet/?group=__world__&wildcard_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fboffosocko.com%2F*&max=50
This could be used for seeing how one's personal has or hasn't been marked up using the tool.

{{jgmac1106}} has used Hypothes.is tools to generate the HTML of his annotations for putting on his own website.
Examples:
