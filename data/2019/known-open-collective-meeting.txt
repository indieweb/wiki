== Agenda ==
* Intros
* Overview of the Open Collective
* Set the Agenda

== Notes ==
* {{mapkyca}} has been “keeping the lights on” and moving closer and closer to 1.0, which he thinks we’re almost there.
* After discussing with Ben, Marcus would like to see a “slicker” experience building on top of the IndieWeb experience.
* Platform-agnostic way to link to and share with friends.
* {{cleverdevil}} it will be valuable to share what they are working on next
** IndieAuth implementation has odd couple hiccups, and the storing of tokens
*** blindly decides to issue new tokens when you reatuth with same tool, save the token and new
*** Amen to that
* {{jgmac1106}} Full page builder for homepage, update to CSS Grid from CSS (willing to start)
** photo post needs an alt text
** Private family network 
** See [[private posts]]
** micropub endpoint
*** can my kids be members of each other site and then share webmentions privately back and forth
* {{jeremycherfas}} Easier access to templating machines
** even thinking a universal theme editor for just fonts and colors
* Talk about Known as a Service.
* Moving from Bootstrap 3 to something more modern.
* Splitting templating from the engine (a suggestion from {{mapkyca}}) to enable things like React frontend on top of Known as a backend.
* Plugin Triage and testing
** I can test plugins and mark those that are no longer supported
*** Question: Do we just remove those whose GitHub haven't been updated in ages
* {{jeremycherfas}} the backend is too complex
** Getting a working Known is too complex
** {{cleverdevil}} suggested working with web hosts to provide 1-click installs and potentially creating something for the AWS Marketplace or Digital Ocean One-Clicks as a community to make it easier.
** {{jeremycherfas}} pointed out his positive experience for “getting started” with Grav that enabled him to get started really quickly.
** {{mapkyca}} has been making positive progress on this front with leveraging Composer. It would be possible to leverage this work and the CLI for Known to smooth installation.
** {{jeremycherfas}} wanted guidance on the documentation and how to contribute there. Currently, the ReadTheDocs documentation is the right approach, and the appropriate place to contribute
* Paul’s priorities
** Long-term goal is to have Known be his central repository of all of his “stuff.”
** Migrating his TypePad and LiveJournal content, Google Plus exports, etc.
** Discussed leveraging Micropub for migrations to benefit the larger IndieWeb ecosystem
** As a user, Paul would love better posting tools – being able to do scheduled posting, changing the publish date, etc,
** Paul is also working on updates for dependencies and a docker-compose update as well, which includes the ability to pull in plugins.
** Could potentially leverage the docker work to provide automated integration testing for plugins. We have a CI pipeline, but its underutilized.
* At 1.0, we should potentially require plugins to be Composer based.

Davidmead asked in chat about importing to Known
* Marcus acknowledged that it is a difficult problem.
* There are documented successful cases in the docs, but that is for mysql to mysql.
* General feeling seems to be that going via Micropub would be a better solution.
