== Notes ==

Currently each silo has their own moderation team and reputation functionality

Moderation team = mods that filter spam and remove harmful content from the platform
Reputation = i.e. FB/Twitter/Reddit likes/dislikes that make the content more/less visible to the other users

Problems:

* each content platform needs to have their own moderation team (or they will be overflown with spam/harmful content)
* moderation very often is not transparent
* moderation often is done for the goods of a for-profit company, instead of end-users
* moderation is censorship
* a lot of web doesn't have moderation or doesn't have sufficient amount of it
* a lot of indie web protocols (i.e. webmentions) will need moderation as well

* {{jtompl}}: IMO instead censorship should never happen, instead, the end-user should decide what they want to read
* {{jtompl}}: users should have an option to decide which moderation service they use (= which moderators they will listen to)
* {{jtompl}}: there's almost no services now that do that, but that's not a problem; the problem is, there's no standard for it, no tools that would use any kind of standard, that would let the users choose the moderation team
* {{jtompl}}: p.s. moderation doesnt need to be manual only, AI can help it (not do 100% of it of course though), like http://www.poly-ai.com or https://akismet.com does
