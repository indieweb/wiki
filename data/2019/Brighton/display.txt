== Notes ==
* How should we track data, how to store, how to display?
* Should it be static?
** It's easier to do things client-side. Javascript libraries are very good in this these days. -> drawing images / lines.
* Downloading maps / tiles is often not allowed. This makes it harder to do stuff server-side (Caching is sometimes allowed)
* Javascript is pulled in at the client, and that's allowed.
** But it's a third party that you're loading in

* Martijn is using Javascript to draw his weight graph. The data itself is in the HTML, as a table. The Javascript is just looking in the table and rendering the map, so it's a progressive enhancement. https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/
* {{rose}} has use Chart.js before https://www.chartjs.org/

* gpx and kml are both XML... could they be transformed with XSLT on the fly to become dynamic maps?

* {{aaronpk}} also wants to talk about daily summaries of his data.
* All the data he has now, is bound to a post.
* This way he's never going to do steps, because he does not want a post per step, and he does not want the steps posted in batches, because there is no real batch-size.
* Should this data go to his day-overview-pages? 
** Is this a post, that is sticked on the top of the day-overview-page?
** Or is this an element on that page, that just lists data?
* Extra complication: he travels a lot between timezones, so some days are much longer or shorter than usual.

* {{adactio}} shows four different summaries of his archives:
** List of posts on the month
** Circles on a graph
** graph of posts as a line
** even audio!

WordPress has day/month archives, but the data isn't aggregated by anything right now.  WordPress stores data in key/value pairs based on the WordPress geodata format.  https://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata Simple Location, written by {{gwg}} stores in this format on all WordPress objects and displays them.

{{petermolnar}} shows https://logstalgia.io/ for getting visuals out of an apache access log - just as potential inspiration for, say, end of the year video summaries

* {{rose}} is thinking about throwing data into Grafana (https://grafana.com/)

* how do you combine data of different sources? e.g. from Compass or other tracking devices.
** {{aaronpk}} has logic in his micropub endpoint to get location data from Compass into his posts.

* {{petermolnar}} stores metadata about photo's in the photo files itself (using EXIF metadata).

* {{aaronpk}}'s monthly overview has all the location data in microformats, so it would be possible to parse those into GeoJSON and then make a map out of it.

* {{aaronpk}} is thinking about using his new unlisted posts feature to store listening history from last.fm, so as not to clutter his timelines

* {{sknebel}} brought up the ideaof moving "tag-cloud" (treemap) visualisation for music data to show how listening to artists/albums/songs change through time
