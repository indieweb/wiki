== Notes ==

Paul feels that people are encouraged to travel to Indie Web Camps, which feels irresponsible.

The "travel" section of Indie Web Camp pages (e.g. Brighton) shows air travel options.

Let's get some data on where people have travelled from for this Indie Web Camp. Maybe it could be part of every Indie Web Camp, like taking a group photo.

Reproduce Rosemary's "IWC in a box"

Homebrew Website Club feels like it "offsets" the carbon footprint of events like Indie Web Camp.

Having Indie Web Camp off the back of a local conference seems good, but is it encouraging people to travel to attend a conference they might not have otherwise attended?

Maybe a bit more editorialising in the travel section of the wiki page for IWCsâ€”encourage trains over planes.

Can we make remote participation better? Paul has tried to join in remotely in the past but it's been a bit iffy,

Switching gears, let's discuss the carbon footprints of our websites.

Netlify can't guarantee a low carbon footprint because they use so many third party services.

The more people write to providers like Digital Ocean, the better.

* [[green computing]]

What if Lighthouse/dev tools had an indication of energy use? Tantek says that Firefox might publicly expose power usage of websites in the UI.

With both Indie Web Camps and websites, we think that exposing carbon footprint data is good for behaviour change: it should make people smug or ashamed depending on the data exposed.

Homebrew Website Clubs grow over time until they reach Indie Web Camp size. Ultimately a wholly-local Indie Web Camp is the ideal.

What is the impact of different payment methods? cash vs credit vs bitcoin

IndieWebCamps have been preferring default vegetarian / vegan meals

Not being present might cause cross-chatter or lag (lcowles) 

Would already traveling to a location (for work or holiday) mitigate, or is this a stance against air travel? 

Could better collaboration tools be a way to increase viability?
