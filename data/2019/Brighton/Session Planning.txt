= Session Planning =

# If you have not proposed a session before, you can propose first
# Intro to how BarCamp sessions are scheduled
#* Sessions are created by the participants in the room
#* You decide a topic you would like to facilitate
#* You don't need to be an expert, being able to ask good questions is sufficient
#* No slide presentations, no product pitches
#* If there is a session similar to yours, see if it makes sense to combine sessions
# write THREE THINGS on a notecard:
## session name
## your name
## session #hashtag - used for archiving the session
# Note: Some rooms will be recorded
# Session scheduling!
# Instructions for session organizers
#* During sessions, appoint at least one person to take notes in etherpad
#* Make sure to wrap up the session five minutes before the next starts to allow a break

Notes for faciliator
* Let session proposers put the sticky note on the board themselves
* Encourage new folks to propose first
* Let people propose their session, then ask how many people are interested, use that to gauge interest to determine room size
