'''<dfn>Private/Protected Posts</dfn>''' was a session at [[2019/Brighton|IndieWebCamp Brighton 2019]].
* Session: Private/Protected Posts
* When: 2019-10-19 15:30

== Participants ==
* {{t}}
* {{rose}}
* {{sebsel}}
* {{aaronpk}}
* Jack Tomaszewski
* {{LCowles}} (remote)
* {{gwg}} (remotely lurking)

== Notes ==
Is private or protected a better term?

Silos have turned the term "private" to mean "friends-only" 
* "private messages" are misleading
* Discourse calls it "private message"
* Slack/Twitter calls it "direct message"

"cryptographically secure" is sufficient for "private" posts

"protected posts" mean other people can see the posts somehow

* {{LCowles}} Aaronpk shared a great example earlier, which I was able to find a browser addon / extension to work with. It wasn't ideal experience, but it did cut out a lot of the L33t user only effect I've seen from other platforms
* {{LCowles}} Fallback is perhaps a nice thing to consider with this.
* {{LCowles}} Token splitting seems to be a way this is approached, but it's difficult compared to having a dedicated structured envelope which is not susceptible/ is less susceptible to user-error (apologies on spelling)
* {{LCowles}} A search appliance may leak if private information is shareable, however it would be possible to inform the query based on the state of logged-in / has key / part of the permitted

{{sebsel}} has two protected post mechanisms currently
* anyone can log in to his site and see all of his checkins, which are not visible publicly
* posts can be restricted to be visible by specific people after they log in

Uses for unlisted posts?
* {{t}} mentions a reply to a specific post that is not syndicated anywhere and is not in any lists, that is visible only in the context of the post being commented on
* {{LCowles}} question for Tantek. If there were a mechanism to reference / embed the post being commented on (optionally within an encrypted envelope), would that meet the need?
** [[publics]] are the combined set of people who make up the readership or audience of a post https://indieweb.org/publics
* {{LCowles}} so not simplistic enough for me to be reductive

Quill (should) support:
* Public
* Unlisted
* Protected (requires some form of authentication)
* Private: Only author can see this
    
Another option could be Encrypted: where it is encrypted with PGP keys, we concluded that this should be a separate option "beyond" private.

Tantek mentioned [[Keybase]]: https://github.com/keybase  e.g. keybase.io/aaronpk (profiles)
