== Notes ==
* context:
** [[2018/Berlin/ethics]]
** https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/09/28/microformats-licensing/

* re multiple licences within a document:
** html sections as headings - didn't work
** has accessibility value
** images can't be sections on their own
** rel-bookmark - can rel-licence be similar?
** {{zegnat}} section can be referenced as rel-bookmark, if it has a rel-licence in it does it work?

* SPDX is de-facto standard for licence indication

* news outlet images/media companies at max only show creator of photographs, no licence information

{{adactio}} fragment is part of the url, can it also be used to detect licence?

* rel licence -> real url or SPDX url-like string

{{zegnat}} if https://spdx.org/licenses/ has a Y on Free -> you can reproduce; if not, go with absolute mininum data (eg. link, maybe headline)
 
{{petermolnar}} was confused about ShareAlike vs Non-Derivatives

{{zegnat}} section licences can be transferred, eg use the whole block as it is on another site

* should systems look into EXIF/XMP/etc metadata as well? (attribution within and EXIF/XMP tag is a bit nasty)

<figure> is self-contained (single unit), not independent

scoping: use link-rel inside a block, then it applies to the block (block being <figure>, <section>, etc)
maybe scope it to a microformat "block", eg. h-entry
