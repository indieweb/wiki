* Twitter without silos
* find a way to pull content from different sources (web, Twitter)
* UI to list, categorize content
* a way to associate 'tweets' with each other on a base of subject
* a way to split them into 'arguments' and 'counterarguments'
* There is a website kialo.com
** Each claim has pros and cons; each of those has a claim and counterclaim too.
** How can that be indie?
** Not a way to change people's minds, but a way to get closer to the truth.
** Depends on people being rational and logical to get a clear view of the truth.
** snopes.com ; fact-checking organizations
* One of many that are checking "truthiness".
* Some of which are very well funded.
* Verifiable claims; in future, could you verify that somebody said something, e.g. In an interview
* Make the claims machine readable.

Problems:
* Twitter is ONLY tweets, so excludes other sources
TWitter's mtivation (as a company) is unknown and not transparent.
* moderation is not transparent, Twitter is in power of the discussion
Everybody should be able to say anything, and it is up to us to decide whether to listen to them or not.
** But they can say what they want on their own site, just not on Twitter.
* recommendation algorithm is not transparent; it might be in favour of the Twitter profit model, insted of the end-user
** Twitter has a monopoly, and competition cant do a tool that would give a better value to the users (i.e. with better recommendation algorithm)
** users cant leave their filter buble
* @Jeremy: Twitter is poisonous, why would you use that?
* algorithm is hidden. It's up to Twitter whether it works ok for us or not.
* If alternative content readers could be created; we would have bigger competition (and transparency?) for recommendation algorithms
* @Juan: Twitter is good to just have content to listen to; but... (?)
    
UI:
* Content 
* Aggregation
* Moderation

@Juan: I want to have a better way to see content

What about citation and references to viewpoints

Is non scientific / mathematic (verifiable / quantifiable) content bound for entropy? Is poor online discourse evidence of this?
