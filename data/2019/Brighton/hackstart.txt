'''<dfn>Hack Start</dfn>''' was a session at [[2019/Brighton|IndieWebCamp Brighton 2019]].

The Hack Start session is a way to get started with ideas gained during the first day, keeping the momentum going. It is also a good chance to grab someone to help you with setup that you would like to get done before Day 2!

Some tips:

* If you want to set up a domain, start as soon as possible. Also bring the TTL on everything down as far as it can go, so you can make changes more easily.
* Do you need to get hosting? This may be something you want to have in place before starting tomorrow!
* Maybe you want to try a certain service, like [[Micro.blog]], this is a good time to get registered.
* Questions about something that came up today? See if you can pair up with someone who has experience to share.
