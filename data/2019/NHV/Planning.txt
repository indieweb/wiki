Subject: Ensuring New Haven's Tech Future

Dear {Company}

New Haven has quickly grown into a tech leader in Connecticut but we worry this revolution will skip the people of the city. As a tech leader will you help ensure a future for all by donating to IndieWebCamp New Haven?

IndieWebCamp New Haven is the first in Elm City. Participants of all abilities learn to hack on personal websites and begin to write themselves a future in tech.

This event is 100% free and organized by all volunteers. We are seeking $100, $200, or $300 donations. We will promote your business online and on our wiki.

Please sign up for a donation spot

Dear {campus club},

We wanted to invite you to IndieWebCamp New Haven.

IndieWebCamp New Haven is an all-levels EdCamp-like collaboration in New Haven for two days of keynotes, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping gain more control over our data and lives online!

Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and – maybe more importantly – encourage all users to own their own content and identities.

Bring your laptop and mobile devices, we’ll help you get set up to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!
