== Notes ==

What's new in iOS 13?

The [https://www.relay.fm/automators/32 Automators Podcast Episode 32] has a lot of info.

* installed by default!
* less dependence on variables
* lots of new triggers like arrive/leave locations, connect to certain wifi network

What does this have to do with IndieWeb?

* [[Shortcuts]] can act as a Micropub client
* Example: share an image on your phone. in the share targets, a "Post a Photo" shortcut appears. choosing it prompts you for e.g. text to include in the post. it sends the micropub post to your site and gets back a URL.

Challenges:
* Micropub requests must be authenticated, so you'll need to store your authorization token and the URL of your micropub endpoint
** a shortcut can be constructed to walk through the IndieAuth steps, but It's Complicated. Easier to create a "Micropub Config" shortcut which outputs a dictionary.
* you make the actual Micropub request with the "Get Contents of URL" action.
** Form-Encoded posts are the easiest, here, but JSON posts can be done. The difficulty is that JSON-encoded posts require all values to be wrapped in an array.

This is hard for us to take notes on because we're all poking at our phones.
