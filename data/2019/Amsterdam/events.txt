== Notes ==
* {{gwg}} posted his first event to his site this month(September 2019). There were no attendees or RSVPs ** https://david.shanske.com/2019/08/29/disneyland-and-california-adventure/
* {{sebsel}} has posted one event to his site, and many RSVPs
* {{jamietanna}} runs Homebrew Website Club in Nottingham and posts all the events for that on his site (https://www.jvt.me/events/homebrew-website-club-nottingham/) but also has a space for other events as they're created https://www.jvt.me/events/
* {{jamietanna}} RSVPs to many events in https://www.jvt.me/kind/rsvps/
{{jamietanna}} generates a iCal + Google Calendar entry for each individual event page (https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/09/02/calendar-single-event/) and a feed for all events (https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/05/22/ical-events-hugo/)
* {{sonniesedge}} has just now posted one event!
* {{martymcguire}} ran HWC in Baltimore and posted many events for that. Also posts events for his improv shows. Also RSVPs to other events. Includes a feed on his homepage in ics format for folks to "Subscribe to Calendar"
** https://martymcgui.re/#events feed of events + RSVPs
** HWC Baltimore event example: https://martymcgui.re/2018/10/16/homebrew-website-club-baltimore/
** Often POSSEs events to Facebook. Used to get RSVPs backfed from FB with bridgy, but that no longer works since FB closed APIs.
* {{t}} posts events and RSVPs

{{sonniesedge}} - what is an event vs an RSVP post?
* {{sebsel}} - event is e.g. for hosting an event - a post about the event. RSVP is a post that you are attending (or not) an event.
** used (used to use? h2vx.com) to turn a list of mf2 h-events into ICS format.

An event is something you organize whereas an RSVP is to say that you're attending an event
- Note that this is true for some definitions of "event" but not all of them (including standards like iCalendar (RFC5545, etc.))

Taras wants to show a calendar on his site so people can see when he is busy, schedule time to meet.

Katrin: alternative to Meetup.com. Logging in to RSVP is not desirable.
* {{jamietanna}} has been working on bridging for Meetup.com, which has an API (https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/). Has a Meetup.com to parsed Microformats2 JSON bridge (https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/08/31/microformats-meetup/). May work on a brid.gy integration to post RSVPs back to Meetup.com.

{{t}}: If you use an hCalendar (mf1 not mf2) then it'll render in Google search event
{{jamietanna}} is interested in this, and whether this could be used for MF2, as all his events are using MF2 h-event markup
* original event from the screenshot at /event is here: https://tantek.com/2019/163/e1/homebrew-website-club-sf
* {{t}} is using http://h2vx.com/ to convert microformats to ICS
{{jamietanna}} recently did this by hand-crafting the ICS, which means it's generated as part of his static Hugo site build, which means it doesn't require any external service

{{t}} shows {{schmarty}}'s Add to Calendar example

{{sonniesedge}} asks about the difference between RSVP and Event feeds, to which {{jamietanna}} shares his RSVP feed for "events he's attending" and that others may want to know, whereas events is for folks who want to know when the next i.e. Homebrew Website Club Nottingham

Anna: great use case for publishing RSVPs is to provide safety and welcoming for people who are attending events. Currently, for Tech Nottingham / Women in Tech, some folks meet up earlier so they can chat / it's not as scary as you know others / you can help find the venue. As part of this, it'd be nice to have some publicly available calendar feed for who (on the Tech Nottingham / WIT Notts community) will be attending which events and who will be available to meet up.

Conversations around private RSVPs and that no one in the group currently does them
Some folks would like to be able to have at least free/busy times, so others can see that

@_die: can we please go back to how to RSVP, and how that then is then received? 

We look at /rsvp on the wiki and what the markup looks like
{{jamietanna}} wrote a howto guide on https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/08/21/rsvp-from-your-website/

How do we manage i.e. limits for attendees? {{schmarty}} says it doesn't look like anyone is currently managing this with Indie events

RSVP "no" is recommended to let organisers know not to expect you, but also to show others that there's an awesome event they may like

{{sonniesedge}} would like to treat events the same way she treats Bookmarks. She would like to publish interesting Events publicly, even if she is not attending. 

{{gregorlove}} generates an ICS file as part of the build of their site
