== Notes ==
The question is: how do we use the 'big tech' to reach people, without being evil?
* when you pay companies like Facebook, even if you have a good cause you need to reach people for, you are still funding these big tech companies to do other more evil things.

Ton gives an example of a local business, who's website was hacked. But they did not care: they had Facebook. (Their website is still spamming others, but they don't fix it.)

* companies want to make the most money, and the most eyeballs are on Facebook right now.
* there was a moment (?) where an organisation wanted to collectively buy Twitter, so that it worked for it's users, not it's stakeholders. (?)

in the specific context of this university:
* the budgets used to reach new students (young people) is no match for the budgets used by other organisations to reach that target audience. A large budget of the univserity is lost this way.
* what is the way you make a persona of these people? maybe you cast to wide a net?

* students are used to have things simplified for them. if there was one platform that says all the different programmes, it would be nice to have that.
** there is already a thing like this, funded by the Dutch government, but how do you get people to use that?

* align your advertizements only with platforms that align with your values.
** are our tools expressing the values we have?

* is there ethical marketing? is that a topic at all?
