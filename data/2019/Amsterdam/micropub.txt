Will [[Micropub]] always work?
* Works great for creating stuff, it needs improvements. Like autocompleting Twitter users on your own site to POSSE to Twitter from your own site. How would that work? Aaron uses a personal addresbook to mention people from Twitter. Not scalable for now. 

* I like to be able to publish to multiple places, from blog to a local site. But when I authorize it's just to one client. 

The app could be better to sign in to multiple accounts. This could work in the current Micropub spec, it's truly a client issue.

Another way to approach this is for instance to favorite an article in Monocle to a specific account (blog, Twitter etc). 

Micropub clients don't do full editing of existing posts yet but it's in the spec.

Micropub clients that are emerging
* [[Indigenous]]
* [[Quill]]
* [[Shortcuts]] on iOS open up a lot of new possibilities
* [[Monocle]]
* [[micro.blog]] iOS app
* [[Together]]
* Micropublish.net

Might be more on the wiki: [[Micropub/Clients]]

Does Micropub give structured data for search engines
* What Micropub actually does is send specific types of information to your server. A title, a text, tags, an image. It's up to your server and CMS/website to actually present this data in the right structured form. It's not up to the micropub client to do this. 

[[micropub.rocks]] is a great tool to test your local implementation of the possibilities of micropub.

There are problems with [[WordPress]] and micropub, especially on the issue of themes and plugins all might be doing something with the post Micropub created. [[WordPress/Themes]] documents a lot of these issues.
