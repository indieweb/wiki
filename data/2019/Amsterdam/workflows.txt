== Notes ==
* How do we share and process information that occurs in real life?
* Mia does it via single person Whatsapp groups.
* Too many tabs is a recurring issue. 
* Where does personal organisation end, and public Indieweb begin?
* Tonz has a script that scrapes Twitter for interesting links.
* Tonz and {{sonniesedge}} using personal sites as journalling and recording tools. {{Sonniesedge}} uses her site directly as an information recording tool. 
* Mia is fearful about putting too much personal information online. What if she wanted to work in a Gov agency at some point - would it bite her?
* {{sonniesedge}} points out how she is radically open online.
* Tonz collects information and daily tries to publish it daily online. 
* {{sonniesedge}} talks about parallels between Journalling and running on own site.
* Tonz follows feeds (RSS and JSON). He consumes them each morning. He organises feeds by social distance of people. Family closes, then friends, then assocaites, then people he knows impersonally. https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/feed-reading-by-social-distance/
* Deliberately makes time to go search for new and related feeds. 
* Marks as read things that have not been read in the last 24 hours.
*  blogs as commonplace book
* Frank sometimes publishes semi-secret posts only via RSS. 

tonz: I've blogged more in the past two years than the previous 15. He feels that by publishing in volume he will produce a few gems. 

How do you form the habits?
