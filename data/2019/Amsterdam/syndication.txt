== Notes ==
What do people on the IndieWeb syndicate and why?

{{t}} I syndicate to Twitter so I don't have to post to Twitter myself. I use the Twitter API for notes, articles. When I added photo support, I used Bridgy.

What is [[Bridgy]]? https://brid.gy/

How do I use Bridgy to publish? (the About link on the home page didn't go to anything that explained how it works, had to scroll to the top)

What platforms can Bridgy publish to? https://brid.gy/ lists Twitter, Instagram, Flickr and GItHub

See issues for new platforms: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+silo%22

How can static site generators work with syndication?

* One POST to Brid.gy, then some logic to Micropub the syndicated URLs back to the site?
* One POST to Brid.gy then stored in some API that can be rendered client-side from the site?

What about duplication of content? We spoke about rel=canonical and the way that you can define who the original owner / author of a post is, so it doesn't impact search engines.
If you don't care about it, duplicate content away, but be aware that it will impact the domain long-term
