== Notes ==
- Discussion question

How to syndicate from a website to Instragram, Flickr, etc.

Who does it?

* {{sonniesedge}} does to Twitter, sometimes. ({{aaronpk}}, {{schmarty}}, too)
** hosts files on DigitalOcean. built own site on CMS into static site, links to assets on CMS server.
* Tonz - posts to Flickr and embeds in his posts on WordPress, doesn't like posting to wordpress first a) because rarely posts singuar photos, b) because it eats into hosting space allowance
* Taras used to use Flickr. They changed their API and/or business model and he stopped.
* {{sebsel}} posts to his own site and after that to Instagram
* {{t}} posts to his own site. Automatic to Twitter/Flickr. Manual second step to post on Instagram.
** (secretly hosts his photos on Swarm/Foursquare, hotlinks to Swarm images. only posts photos when checking in. private checkins.)
* {{schmarty}} hosts his photos on his server, using micropub and a media endpoint, and has an image proxy to serve smaller versions
** uses https://cloudinary.com Cloudinary to resize images etc for use in pages / postings.
* {{aaronpk}} my photos are served by my webhost. I post them directly or they come from Instagram (via OwnYourGram) and then my site saves a copy of it so I'm not dependent on Instagram.
* {{aaronpk}} treats photos as "visual tweets". In the moment. He's looking for ways to do albums of experiences. How to curate the IA of this is hard. How to keep images out of his URL unique to each day is hard.
* {{aaronpk}} cloned his Flickr account to his own domain, in order to preserve photos. 
* {{aaronpk}} and {{sonniesedge}} keep collections of photos and other content types.
* {{t}} uses Flickr because they have such good API support.
* The concept of a Collection is still very loose. A collection can be a collection of photos, or other things.

Is this, here's the sandwich I had for lunch, or here's the trip I went on to Amsterdam and a nice album of photos you should check out?
