== Notes == 

=== Getting [[webmentions]] to work for [[email]] ===
* One of the strategies is similar to what salesforce does for "Email to Salesforce"
* On the contact form, indicate if communication is private or can be syndicated.
* Websites can have associated maildrops that they check for syndicated content.
* When an email is sent, it gets copied to a drop box that the site checks to syndicate the content to the website.
* Perhaps the checkbox adds a header that the website respects when deciding whether to forward the content to the drop 

=== Sending out newsletters ===
Solutions:
* [https://www.campaignmonitor.com/ CampaignMonitor]
* [[MailChimp]]

You can publish an issue as a simple HTML template on your own website. and then use a script or something to send that URL to a service like MailChimp.
That way your email newsletter content isnt stuck in a silo (MailChimp, etc.)
* Example: https://jaredwhite.com/newsletters/


The future... don't use AMP for Gmail :-)

* Cheryl: Put your most important content at the top of the email issue, people won't scroll through a long message
