== Notes ==
A discussion led by Julia about the ideas behind her project The Attention Fair theattentionfair.com
Major goal is to show people how the information they supply actively and passivey, intentionally and unintentionally has a value.

She has devised a series of "games" in which people can gain value for sharing things; most of them can be seen from her site.

Discussion then focused on to what extent people are aware of the value of their behaviour. The conclusion is that the vast majority of people are not aware of these things. Julia said that these people often responded by saying, "What a cool science fiction project". Rather like Black Mirror. Others, who are already at least partially aware, agree that it is a fair and accurate picture of what is going on, even though it is an "art" project.

Julia made it her mission to talk about algorithms at every party she went to. Nobody wanted to engage. They just thought she was nuts.

She also pointed out that often algorithms are not very smart; she is allergic to dairy and has not consumed milk or yoghurt for years. Nevertheless, most of the "personalised" coupons she gets from Albert Hijn are for milk or yoghurt.
