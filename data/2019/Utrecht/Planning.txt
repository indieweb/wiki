==Things to check== 

===Checked with venue===

* Access through gates on the weekends > There will be a pedestrian/bicycle gateway open for both days. Access with a car and parking will be done by phone. This number will be communicated on signage
* WiFi and/or LAN > Available and ready to use
* Use of kitchen area > We can use the kitchen area. There is a microwave, there are enough cups and glasses for approx 20 people. We'll bring paper cups as well. Just in case.
* Use of beamer and TV > There is a beamer + screen and a TV we can use for demo's. We would have to see how to setup for intro's on Saturday.
* Number of seats > There are approx 20 chairs and a few comfy couches. 
* How to divide the space for breakout sessions > No need for the space to divide. We also have an extra small space available (3-4 people max) for small breakouts
* What's the latest we can use the space (for Eurovision viewing) - Unfortunately we have to leave the offices around 7-8PM. It's adviced to check somewhere in town. We can figure out how to combine this with group dinner?
