== Notes ==
* how do we make this the year of discovery?
* how do we build an indieweb version of [[Nuzzel]]?
* Discovery: micro.blog has hand curated feed - just 1 person, community manager of micro.blog
** some downsides - 1 person, 1 timezone, can mostly serve on US times
** but lots of positives - potentially avoid negativity, nsfw content

* new are the emoji-feeds: feeds that work based on emoji people use. These tagmoji are restricted; the decision to have a tagmoji lies with micro.blog
* also a photos feed at /discover/photo; does not include photos that have come in from a non-hosted site via a feed.
* muted people are filtered out
* aaron has a page - aaronpk.com/emoji - profile pic changes based on emoji in the post
* seb also has this on his site - seblog.nl/emoji

* stream.indieweb.org - public indieweb feed - comes from aaron's aperture, curated by aaron
** similar to micro.blog in that it is curated - except aaron curates who goes in to the feed, and only for #indieweb hashtag (or link to indieweb.org)

* indiewebring is another way of discovering people - clicking on the links in the webring takes you to a new person in the ring

* belong.io - an example that needs adding to the discovery page (andy baio of xoxo festival)
** links from people that he follows that are talked about or interacted with a lot 

*({{tonz}}: I have a Twitter harvester running for hashtags of interest, get the links from them  rank them by usage today / last week, and resolve shortened links to indicate types (video, presentation, pdf, blog etc.)
** similar to Nuzzel approach

* would you rather be addicated to facebook/twitter or the indieweb?
** on facebook you know you are being played with

* another example: bulletin.p3k.io/indieweb
** similar to belong.io - links mentioned in the indieweb channel - sorted by recency and how many people are talking about it

* discovery vs discoverability - how you want to be discovered
* can you follow a particular hashtag?

* indieweb.xyz
** people can submit based on a particular topic
** it could be combined with curation

* kickscondor.com/hrefhunt
** personal websites that he thinks are cool and worth sharing

* automationorchard.com
** python scripts pulling from rss feeds
** manually built list of websites to be included

* https://seblog.nl/2018/10/22/13/three-things-about-readers
** graph db - neo4j
** looks at feeds and pulls the likes from it
** captures who likes different posts
** both aaron and seb like a particular tweet
** the db can be queried to pull out posts with greater number of tweets
** seb discovered joschi through seeing a like from someone else
** you can see likes from the feeds that you follow
** could also work on links, bookmarks, etc - doesn't have to just be likes
** would like to let you 'choose your own algorithm'
** github.com/sebsel/leesmap
** one in laravel and one in elixir

* aaron: separating readers in to smaller projects helped build it
** same could be done for discovery
** split the problem into smaller projects
*** algorithm is one of the hard parts
** could existing building blocks help?
*** maybe websub - could be used as part of building a crawler

*{{tonz}} publishes an opml list of the feeds I follow, so others can explore that. 
** {{chrisaldrich}} does the same, I believe.
