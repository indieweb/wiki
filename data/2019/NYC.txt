<div class="h-event">
'''<dfn class="p-name">IndieWebCamp NYC 2019</dfn>''' is a two-day maker event for creating and/or improving your personal website. All levels welcome! One of several [[Planning|2019]] IndieWebCamps and the seventh IndieWebCamp in NYC!

It will be held 2019-10-05 and 2019-10-06 at Pace University in Manhattan, New York City.

<div class="e-content">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. Yet we need to build both the technical and societal systems to ensure a free and open web for the future. We invite computer engineers, hackers, activists, teachers, students and journalist to this two day event.

For two days computer science students, hackers, designers, engineers, and everyone interested in the web come together to help build tools that will allow everyone to take control of their data and own their own domain. The top engineers in the world attend IndieWebCamps.

IndieWebCamp will also draw many educators who have taken interest in "Domain of One's Own" for students. Many university faculty will attend both locally and remotely to discuss how we bring the #IndieWeb to K12 and higher education.

For journalists at the event we want to rethink how local news can support the local news. No one took a greater hit from the silos than journalists. It is clear truth soon followed.

Regardless of your studies or what you do for a living #IndieWebCamp is for everyone. If you just want to launch your first blog and have never been online before...well then you are the guest of honor. Come down and take control of your digital identity.
