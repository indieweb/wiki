== Notes ==
*How do we own everything on our personal site? 
**product reviews, transaction history, health records, single shopping cart, terms and conditions for site visitors, 

A discussion around building healthy relationships online and in the real world

"Build technology that empowers people in real life.  Code has to be on our side. "

*Unified a support experience
**Go on own site, issue support cases, start the use case from your individual site

*Unified history across all retailers you do business with
**Instead of Amazon.com, look at the retailers inside of Amazon and do business with them directly

**Goal:  You are the data broker of your own information**

*Setting terms and conditions with everyone you interact with online
**Open transparency, share what you are doing with their data, clear plain language
 
***Closest experience is Metamask using blockchain technology

Product reviews on your own site. 

Update information in a single place only...

Unified support experiences 

Automation and integration..unified information.

{{tantek]] wants to broaden it...what is a business in an Indieweb system? 

This is yet another problem....there is interest in how the Indieweb would solve these problems.

Concern re ethics and UI...

Possible Goals

* Start a 'reboot' new blog...
* Own your reviews
