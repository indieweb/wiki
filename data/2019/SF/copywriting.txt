== Notes ==
Writing interface copy for the Indieweb

[[OAuth]] - scope / permissions, like a key card
* description of scope
* miscommunication of impact of scope
* remove complexities
** simplifying it as a dev
** make it obvious
** don't make me think
** Feynman technique

8 seconds to understand something or people give up

Billboard technique, less than 7 words

Eliminating the single point of person(SPOA, SPOS, etc)

Write it in text (microcopy) first, then do visuals

Idea to add a wiki page for all the community services...Micropub services like OYS, webmention services like Bridgy.

Write like you're speaking to a human. We are after all a "people first" centered group.

{{gwg}} is scared about the idea of us growing too fast without being able to handle it. {{tantek}} is not if we get Vouch handled to avoid the negativity migrating there without tools.

{{jacky}} accepted he is a content farm. 

"Institute of the Future of the Book" = updatable books? 

As an example of this, why don't we simply use the phrase @mention instead of calling them webmentions? People already know what the functionality is, they don't need to know what the spec is called. Our real innovation is simply making @mentions work across platforms.

[[Micro.blog]] will be even more powerful when it has a large competitor and both it and the competition allow easy import/export of data and interoperability.

'Sane defaults' - decisions not options.

[[indiewebify.me]] as a copywriting example

Adopt an old wiki page today!

Talk like a human

Use plain language

Would be great to have a glossary!
