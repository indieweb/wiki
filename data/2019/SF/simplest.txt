== Notes ==
*How do we setup and build a site with ease? 
*There are many academics who want to host and hack their own stuff.  We need to target them and make it easier for them upload content.  
** In a portion of academia there is the A Domain of One's Own aka [[DoOO]] which is broadly run by Reclaim Hosting, who tested it out of University of Mary Washington
* What is considered an indie web site?
** depends on your use-case
** Starts with a domain and ownership/control of one's URLs

== Solutions ==

*Webflow
*Wordpress
*Known
*Micro blog
*Gitlab 
* https://i.haza.website/

== Steps to setup a site ==
Minimum set of requirements so you can connect with others in the indie web community.

*Register domain
*Hosting
*Authentication
**Twitter
**Github
*Add Content

== Persuasive reasons to setup your own site ==
*Own your own content independently of third party silos
*Aggregate content from multiple sites to draw traffic to personal site
*Keep all of your content in one location

== Two ways to use the indie web == 
*Post on your site and then publish on third party sites
*Publish somewhere else first, then use third party APIs to pull into your own personal site

*Negatives
** If you're not on their site they will shut down 
** There is GDPR 

*Microblogging 
Wants something as simple as Github pages to sign up and create content 

== Is Indie Web at scale a thing?  Do we want to grow the indie web?  ==
*The core of the indie web community is building things for themselves, but how do we create a user-friendly experience for a big audience
* The number of people who have indie web sites who are non-technical is small
* Interested to see how we can grow the indie web beyond technical people
** Greg  {{jgmac1106}} will be using Known sites and Glitch with middle school and high school students
** Teach  the non technical to be technical 
http://buildyourfirstwebsitelessonplans.glitch.me/] 
* Come up with a simple way to set people up without reading the instructions, create a guided tutorial
** Ben tried to do this with KNOWN

== Ideas == 
* Host photographs on your own personal site, take a small slice of the indie web, post your pics in a way that you have a full record in everything you ever took
** people at the lego league challenge were blown away by ability to post videos and pics... Good idea
* Connect with local art organizations. Many artists sick of Etsy/Instagram...Teach them to build their own
