Setup
* Step 1: Start wifi hotspot
* Step 2: Connect all devices to the hotspot
* Step 3: Turn off mobile data on all mobile devices
* Step 4: Turn on Bluetooth on all devices

You're now all connected to the same wifi network, but without access to the internet.

How to connect and collaborate?

Test: Load an address of some kind in a web browser, that results in renderable web content

HTTP over TCP on local network
* Connectivity: LAN
* Steps: Type IP address int a web browser
* Results: Mixed - some network configurations can prevent this from working
* Notes
** Android phone hotspot worked fine for loading local network webservers.
** But Mozilla's guest network does IP isolation, so it didn't work at all.
** Challenge: lack of human readable names like DNS provides.
** Challenge: no network discovery of available websites
** Challenge: no HTTPS for local DNS-less websites

Airdrop
* Connectivity: Bluetooth
* Steps: Open Airdrop, and drop a file on a person listed there
* Results: Failure - no way to do anything web
* Notes
** Mac OS X laptop computers were able to share files. That's not the web.
** One laptop couldn't see the iOS device but the other one could.
** Mac OS X prompted for Bluetooth, which seems odd - not clear what was used to transfer

Secure Scuttlebutt
* Connectivity: LAN, Bluetooth
* Steps: Open SSB client, and try to connect to the other person in the room
* Results: Failure - no way to do anything web
* Notes
** We tried Patchwork on Mac OS X, Manyverse on Android, Planetary on iOS
** We connected Patchwork and Manyverse, but not Planetary

TODO
* Test Beaker Browser ([[Dat]])
* Test IPFS - embedded node in Brave, IPFS Desktop + IPFS Companion browser extension
