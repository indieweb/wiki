Session: Reputation & Subjective Web<br>
When: 2019-12-07 13:45

== Participants ==
* Eril GÃ¼n Ezerel (session facilitator)
* Johnny (twitter: @generativist)
* {{gRegor}} (remote)
* {{chrisaldrich}} (remote/partiial)
* {{addyourself}}

== Notes ==
* There's a distrust on the web.
* Why are you sharing what you're sharing? Are those real followers? Is it fake news?
* It's extremely noisy online now
* It would be nice to mark something as "out of band" e.g. if you're shitposting or just being silly.
** example: Chris Aldrich has [[chicken]] posts which are goofy/silly and just can't be taken seriously. How could this be expanded upon? Snark-mark posts?
*** chicken is v srs bizness in 2019 #chickfila -- gRegor remote shitposting in the notes
* On Twitter you can either be super professional and share one type of thing or...
** You get this "ambient intimacy" following people online

Subjective Web
* Think of the web as a world with mountains, rivers, forests
* Now it feels like there's all this industrial pollution
* There are people who learn how to work in this toxic place. You may not know if something is toxic before tasting it.
* How can we create a subweb for people who are experienced in filtering this toxic world to bring good things?
** Kind of like a closed subweb, modular. You can interact with a lot of subwebs.
* There needs to be a way to "break out" and not be implicitly in these algorithmic feeds
