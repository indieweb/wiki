== Bradley Allen ==
* http://bradleyallen.info/
* was going through the wiki, partially to see if he could follow it, anything he's stuck with
* has beginning of an [[h-card]]
* section for latest posts
* has a question about p-summary
* {{t}}: "everything is optional" (with microformats)
* needs to template-ize, could be [[Eleventy]] or something else
* some live code feedback from the room

== Jen Simmons ==
* https://jensimmons.com/
* showing a [[CSS Grid]] demo
* problem with this demo right now is that it's not [[accessible]]
* if you look the HTML, you'll see each letter wrapped in a span
* feels ikcy, feels wrong
* vague memory from a decade ago
* shows Firefox Accessibility inspector
* you have to turn it on
* you can inspect accessibility properties
* this heading is no longer the word "graphic design" but rather the individual letter g r a p h etc.
* experimented with fixing this with ARIA roles
* got a recommendation from Marco at Mozilla
* put aria role="none" on each of the individual spans
* it has the effect of removing those span letters
* all those span containers are gone, now its just text leafs of the letters
* not sure if a screenreader will do the right thing here
* best way to do it would be rewrite the HTML
* put aria-hidden = true on the individual letters
* and aria-label on the heading itself
* Accessibility inspector helps you see what's going on with ARIA etc.
* it is off by default, you have to turn it on which activates the whole accessibility engine
* you can also check color contrast, color blindness etc.
