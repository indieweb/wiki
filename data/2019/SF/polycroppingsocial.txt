== Notes ==
Anchor Points on Social Media:
* People - we know how to do that: follow, not follow, ban
* Topics -- we don't know how to do that (well)
* Economy -- how many "likes" can somebody issue
    
Different types of Likes
    
Thesis: "If we had the ability to locally innovate in algortihms (e.g. on your own IndieWeb site) we'd not see a lot of the problems that (centralized) social media has today"
    
* If people had a variety of tools for implenting algorithms on their own site, they'd likely have a number of options and could change the freely at will so that they could find what suits them at the time. 
** I'm in line at the grocery store and want to catch up on some quick photos
** I've got an hour or two to sit and actively read longer pieces
** I want to spend 30 minutes scanning bookmarks to find something to read later in the day.
** What has my family been up to this week
** What is happening with regard to my hobbies x,y,z
