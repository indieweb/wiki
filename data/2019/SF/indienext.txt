== Notes ==
* Indienext
* Beyond HTTP
* how to bridge some of these
* what can we learn from [[Secure Scuttlebutt]], and projects like that
* people can just start by installing an app
* that's what it boils down to
* install, and you're already in
* next, where do you go to find people
* in SSB, the first people you meet are your bias
* how do we do heterogenous discovery
* how not to only be a giant recommendation engine
* SSB focus is not on heavy social interactions
* but more about bringing it into places where it doesn't work
* people could connect in the same room even without internet
* the network replicated
* concern: if i can't see what i'm replicating, what if i'm replicating bad stuff?
* storage - i'm storing other people's stuff
* indieweb assumes an online-ness
* ssb assumes no-internet at the start
* which means you're in control
* how to fold that into indieweb context
* how to find and follow people
* goal - how to interface w/ ssb while still on the indieweb
* eg: hub that pulls news from wikipedia and posts to ssb so the conversation can happen there
* darius kazemi
* bot that takes rss and pushes to activitypub
* that's an angle
* [[microsub]] - would love to see active news in the way it's on twitter
* want to see reactions from that platform
* be able to see traction/activity/statistics
* [[ActivityPub]] space - people building bridges
* twitter, instagram, newsletter
* gRegor's goal - get off facebook by new year
* been archiving posts
* want to give family a way
* they're not going to set up a [[reader]]
* one-time password
* roll my own [[newsletter]]
* i have things everywhere
* want to just have one firehose feed
* fb groups are the hardest
* fb groups for events and activism
* ease of joining
* i just want things to work
* easy for the racists to organize too
* whatsapp groups
* subscriptions
* can be passive or active
* subscription vs follow
* follow is a publicly broadcasted event
* subscription is a private event between you and author (sometimes)
* agenda here - how to begin to make actual groups
* ssb  - [[hashtag]] as channel
* propagates further that way
* activitypub - can use hashtags
* that's how i use mastodon
* follow hashtag, eg new york
* sex workers moved to mastodon from twitter, use that for location
* how to make groups
* how are they defined
* how to discover groups
* indiewebonline
* can see who's a member of a group
* if you webmention to a page, it shows you
* it's not a group per se
* groups have baggage - moderation, etc
* that's not the case here
* do i have to have it on my site?
* can we have indiegroups - some external service?
* groups are incentive to come back
* hey look what i made
* i can't throw it out to the ether and that's cool
* but with a group i know i'll get more directed feedback/interaction
* biggest takeaway: need to make groups work on indieweb
* bridging dat to indieweb
* super hard
* wrote something that pushes out to dat
* shows replies
* needs to work without http
* boom you just crossed the line
* lots of challenges for interoping http with non-http systems
* archive.org
* with [[Dat]], have local copy
* sidenote: trust, where does it come from
* icann video - alternatives to dns
* replace gltds
* ens
* the b word
* groups
* friendlier than hashtags
* food to me isn't food to another
* people in interested like minded topics
* meta: in this conversation, a broad topic (beyond http) narrowed the fov to a single use-case (fb groups replacement)
* rel=[[payment]]
* this is how they got ninja over to mixer
* game streamer with huge following
* ms bought him out to get him to mixer
* wordpress guy is shutting us down for group photo
* This meeting has been terminated by host
