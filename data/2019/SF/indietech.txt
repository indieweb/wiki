== Notes ==
Main question: If we were to rebuild this all over again from the start, what would we do?

=== Requirements ===
* ease of use
* reduce harm
* easy to adopt

=== Basic Choices Made ===
==== DNS ====
* Everyone has a [[DNS]] resolvable domain name
** How does Secure Scuttlebut do this? (there was some discussion about this in a session earlier this morning)
** Alternatives being public PHP keys
** Tor to aoid DNS, location independence
     
==== Domain names ====
     
==== HTTP/HTML ==== 
* Alternatives, [[IPFS]], [[Dat]] NNTP, Gopher, etc
* Primary probems: sniffability, security, speed
* Markdown, JSON, RSS/Atom/Jsonfeed - none are as expressive as HTML
* What should the user see versus what does the computer see?
JSON - poor internationalization support, (a11y), also poor it8n 
*Adactio has noted and uptake of RSS recently
Is anything more expressive than HTML?
      
==== A website representing you/your identity ==== 

====  [[Microformats]]  ====
* Alternatives, vcard, RSS, ActivitiyStream, etc
* Issues with multiple formats in the same HTML page
* Own all the parsers! ;) 
* DRY violations?

==== Webmention ====
* Outdated but still useful.  What can we use instead of Webmention?  
* Find something to flag abuse .  We could use a tool to moderate content at a prototocol level.  
* Let's explore solutions to replace Webmention and reduce harassment online
* Someone mentioned economics this morning, so could one need to earn some sort of value store and then spend it as time goes by to post, like, webmentions, etc.?

==== Rel-me and rel-me auth ====
* OpenID as an alternate provider
* PGP? rel-PGP key 
** Have a site with a limited amount of user access plus have a public site with a broader user base

==== IndieAuth ====

==== Micropub ====
* Micropub is for publishing
* XML-RPC (still used by Micro.blog, WordPress), client tools, 
* Could be bend old chat protocols to work for this use case?
* Negatives:  Security: Pre O-AUTH, forces users to give their usernames and passwords to untrusted applications  ??????!!!!!!!!!!???? <- what does this negative refer to?  i missed some of the context, but @t should know. 
* Post what you want to your server, easy to post
* Someone proposed Markdown as a global solution inside of Micropub
* Difficult to use for newbies.  Want to make it easier to use.  
* Extensible vocabulary

==== Websub ====

==== Microsub ====
* Microsub allows one to read and subscribe

* Not Required
** javascript

=== What if we had decided differently? ===
* How would using alternatives allow better security, privacy, reduction of abuse, safety, mitigating harms?
* Pick one you would have done differently?
** Could it still work/dovetail with what already exists?
