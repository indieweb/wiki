Session: Bringing Vouch Forward<br>
When: 2019-12-07 15:20

== Participants ==
* {{jacky}} (session facilitator)
* {{chrisaldrich}} (remote)
* {{tantek}}
* {{andigalpern}}
* {{gRegor}} (remote)
* {{addyourself}}

== Notes ==
* {{jacky}} is considering an idea that others have also considered...generating a follow list that can be used as a [[Vouch]] list.
* Works on the [[FOAF]] principle...you trust them to leave comments
* The [[chat-names]] page on the wiki could be used as a Vouch, but a weak one.
* {{tantek}} is suggesting you could allow people on weaker vouch, but you could always remove the mention afterwar

Sources of vouches:
* Twitter lists
* Blogrolls (or Webmention directories/blogrolls like Colin Walker's https://colinwalker.blog/directory/
* Indieweb [[chat-names]]
* urls in Follow posts

Things to consider
*What is trust?
*What is reputation?
*How do you determine trust and reputation?

More questions
* How do we approve new comments and new users? 
* Do we trust people to post a comment where we are okay with cleaning it up later.? 
* Should we automatically trust people? 

* Goals:  Wants to post on personal site and receive comments
* Wants to hide comments that are irrelevant
* Wants this to be as low-touch as possible and occur in the protocol level

Ideas
* Implement a system to pull in contacts and vouch for them
* Blocklist, allowlists, and social rating system
* Add a tag to label different types of users 

github.com/indieweb/vouch

* {{gRegor}}: My vouch implementation periodically pulls in a list of links from a following/blogroll page (https://gregorlove.com/following/) and whitelists those domains for incoming webmentions
** The webmention plugin supports requiring the vouch parameter on incoming webmentions, though I don't have that option enabled since Vouch isn't widely implemented.
** For outgoing webmentions, I follow the same algorithm Ben Roberts documented. tl;dr: process referer links, validate they actually link to me, filter out some domains (google, twitter, etc.), then store as potential vouches
*** This is mostly just running behind the scenes, I haven't checked on it in a while. DId run into an issue where a webmention to {{Zegnat}} sent a github voucher URL, which he did not allow bc anyone could set up a github profile.

The difference between censorship and moderation has to do with who puts them in place. 

Each person can decide what they do with their vouches or non-vouched mentions. 

Some sites allow comments, some don't. Some allow flagging of comments...

Ben Roberts and {{gregor}} are the only people noted as having implemented sending of Vouches, and only 4 people actively note accepting/receiving Vouches. 

Vouch is subjective, there is no objective trust... 

One could also use values of h-cards for vouch-type thresholds. Example: If I don't indicate publicly that I'm a vegetarian, then I can't post on another site/forum/etc. Similarly if common rel="me" not cross-linking/matching.
* What if they post [[chicken]]s? - definitley ban them!!

If Carol does not have an h-card with an avatar, or other parameters like that, as a vouch value.
