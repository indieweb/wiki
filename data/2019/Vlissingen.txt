We're meeting for a '''Hackweek right before FOSDEM 2019''' !

<div class="e-content">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness.
<br>
We have invited <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/SocialCG/" class="p-name p-org" target="_blank">W3C Social CG</a> people and <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/meet-the-inrupters/" class="p-name p-org" target="_blank">Inrupters</a> to create sustainable FLOSS communities and raise awareness in politics and media.
Let's create awesome OpenSource stuff around the federated- and indieweb. 
We will tinker in a water tower, the base for the event.


Join us for '''five days''' of brainstorming, working, helping.
