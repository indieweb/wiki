== Aaron Parecki ==

== Rayna Harris ==
* http://raynamharris.com
* accomplished a bunch of tiny things on her site
* no longer a github.io URL, got a domain: raynamharris.com
* added a photo and an [[h-card]]
* the footer was only working on one page, fixed so it works across all pages
* played with some CSS themes, fixed the heading sizes
* the blog she did the most work on. Wrote a post yesterday about using asciinema
* text-based screenshare so you can copy/paste command line stuff
* used the IWC wiki to find other [[Jekyll]] people with a share section, added a "post on twitter" link, a "reply on twitter", "copy the permalink", and [[disqus]] comments

== gRegor Morrill ==
* {{gRegor}}, https://gregorlove.com
* first project was to write stuff. Did that, about this very demo [https://gregorlove.com/2019/02/my-two-projects-for-todays/]
* then made a [[gallery]] view that is responsive with [[CSS Grid]]

== David Millar ==
* {{dgtd}}, http://davegoesthedistance.com
* added product [[microformats]]
* started adding list of friends at the bottom of the page and [[XFN]]
* started upgrading mf1 to mf2 on http://thegriddle.net and fixing some bugs, hopes to have it ready to in next week or so

== Stephen Bowling ==
* http://stephenbowling.com
* started a plugin to authorize through his own website, using a local copy of [[micropub.rocks]] as a demo

== Isaiah ==
* https://isaiah.micro.blog
* @Isaiah on Twitter, Instagram, [[micro.blog]]
* blogs about his development
* working on a client for micro.blog
* shows signin mechanism with Kiwi
* client has a nice narrow view for micro.blog, similar to oldschool twitter client
* sometimes some big pictures and they don't fit well in the timeline
* slurping up HTML, parsing images so he can output it anyway he wants... made some progress on that today, doesn't have a demo of it
* hopefully available for download soon!

== Manton Reece ==
* {{manton}}, https://manton.org
* yesterday's [[2019/Austin/webio|session on linkrot]] reminded him he wanted to work on [[micro.blog]] import/export
* worked on a format called [[blog archive format]]
* exports in this format, uploads to S3
* it's a zip file with two files: index.html, jsonfeed, and a photos folder
* HTML has plain layout, but mf2
* all posts have relative paths for the folder
* idea is there is a usable format (you can look at it) but it's also machine readable
* second thing he worked on is adding [[microsub]] support to micro.blog as a server
* sign into [[Monocle]] account with micro.blog
* timeline, mentions, and favorites show up in Monocle
* only supports new posts now, not old posts, so you can't scroll back far
* added [[in-reply-to]] functionality, so can reply directly from mb

== Collin ==
* made a rough video recap of this event, played it for us
* got a logo animation, intends to have some voiceover

== Tom Brown ==
* {{tbbrown}}, http://herestomwiththeweather.com
* started documenting an easy way to get set up with WordPress and a reader
* ran into some issues with Dreamhost, went back to Reclaim Hosting
* hoping to have something to recommend to get set up with a reader quickly

== Cornelius Toole ==
* http://micro.corntoole.com
* his easy task today was connecting [[micro.blog]] to his domain
* working on blog archive format
* starting point was whatever the host gives you, since you don't usually have a choice
* found a feed-into-json project and forked it
* grabs an RSS feed from Micro Mondays
* and it will spit out index.html, index.json
* showed the resulting HTML
* showed the template he's using for the HTML markup. Posted a link in chat and would welcome feedback.
* with audio and even images, you can get into some big filesizes. Might need to export HTML first then addon tools to incrementally download assets

== David Shanske ==
* {{GWG}}, https://david.shanske.com
* shows logging in to [[Quill]]
* much to his disappointment, there's no picture of the logged-in user on Quill
* submitted a PR that adds it on the Quill homepage when you're logged in
* the [[IndieAuth]] endpoint returns the name and photo of the user
* also added [[geofencing]], within the fenced area won't show the precise location, just a name like "home"
* made a bunch of fixes to code used by [[Yarns]] and [[Post Kinds Plugin]]

== Constantine Murenin ==
* http://constantine.su/
* Set up http://idk.su, a landing page for his email address
* may be DNS issues. "It works on my phone"
