Check the IndieWeb wiki for platforms, projects, CMS, or even programming language to find pre-existing examples and methods. This can make getting up and running much faster and simpler and even provide design examples of how these things are commonly done or have been done in the past.

== Pain points or barriers to entry ==
* public by default if privacy is a concern
* fragility if you integrate with a service you rely on that service
* lack of guanunteed support
* apis versus scrapping
* need your own website. little of this stuff is free
* nerdy and technical 

if you have a index.html page is this a way to start? yes

What is micropub?

* once implemented and working, lots of clients you can use to post things to your site. very powerful once implemented
* Aaron's Quill lets you post notes and longer articles. reference implementation. 

Search the indie web wiki for a project for keywords (language, hosting application) to view some examples that you can use those open source versions to create what you need
