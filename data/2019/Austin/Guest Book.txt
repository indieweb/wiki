=== Remote Participants ===
As with past IndieWebCamps, we'll setup [[remote participation]] for folks who can't be there in person but can still participate during the camp over [[discuss|chat]] and hopefully live video.

=== Regrets ===
Folks that can't make it (but hopefully can participate before/after remotely!)

=== Missed ===
Sorry to miss you! Hope you can attend a future IndieWebCamp!
