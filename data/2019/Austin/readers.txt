== Notes ==
Aaron shows [[Monocle]] and sign in process.

View source on his site shows the authorization_endpoint, token endpoint (these tell "how to log in") and the microsub endpoint (this tells "where to get the data")

these are the three key pieces, one points to homepage one points to aperture

<code>
<link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://aaronparecki.com/auth">  
<link rel="microsub" href="https://aperture.p3k.io/microsub/1">
<link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://aaronparecki.com/auth/token">
</code>

After logging in, everything you see in Monocle is fetched from the microsub endpoint.

Demos an MVP site, sets up simple Hello Austin page.
* Tries to log into [[Quill]], shows error messages for not finding authorization endpoint, gives you code you can copy
* After adding the authorizatoin endpoint and trying again, Quill gives a similar error about the token endpoint, along with code you can copy.
* Updates the HTML to link to his github with [[rel-me]] so he can sign in with [[IndieAuth]]

Back in Monocle, he can sign in now but the MVP site doesn't have a microsub endpoint. Aaron happens to know of one: [[Aperture]]!
* Signs in to Aperture and is given another HTML snippet to copy/paste

The point of all this is: you don't need a fancy site to use a social reader, you can delegate out to other services.

Since Monocle uses your own site to find the microsub endpoint, you can change that (the source of your subscriptions) on your site and it will work in Microsub readers.

Monocle doesn't tell you the instructions for how to set up an account, but Quill does
