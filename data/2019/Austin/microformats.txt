== Notes ==
* https://microformats.org
* microformats.io is a great intro. 
* [[Tagline]]: "Microformats, we do it with class"

Each piece of information has a property identified in the class attribute 

With these classes, a parser can extract that information.

Syntax is documented on microformats.org

Microformats 2 is prefixed.
* h - Root object
* p - plaintext value
* u - URL value
* dt - date value
* e - html value (element tree properties where entire element is the value)

=== Questions from attendees ===    
Q: Should we add microformats on the front of our list of pre-existing classes or the end? 
* A: Append microformats to the end of the list of other classes (which are typically used for CSS styling)

Q: Are they order dependent?
* A: Parsers and other things don't care, so it shouldn't matter

Q: What is Webmention?
* A: See [[Webmention]] as well as [https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet Webmentions: Enabling Better Communication on the Internet]

Services for webmention: [[webmention.io]]

Idea: 
* additional representative photos that are marked up with mood, so that one could attach a mood to a post to specify a preference for which photo to be picked up by receiving sites (for webmentions).
