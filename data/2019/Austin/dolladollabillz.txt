* {{aaronpk}}
* {{jackjamieson}}
* {{addyourself}}

== Payment Methods ==
* [[indiepay.me]]
** Requires trust/a small community
** Exchanges (e.g. blockchain) requires more trust than is typically warranted
* Patreon and XOXO
** Requires trust of Patreon as payment provider
** Helps complicated reconciliation, such as A owes $5 to B, B owes $5 to C, therefore A should pay $5 to C and B requires no action
* Kickstarter
* PayPal/Venmo
* Bitcoin/Litecoin/whatevercoin/etc
* Brave Browser & BAT

=== Paying for Existing Content ===

** Brave/BAT set up but not actively used

=== Pledging for New Content ===

=== General Sponsorship/Donations ===
* ?
** PayPal donation button
** Amazon wishlist
* {{aaronpk}}
** https://aaronparecki.com/tip/ - accepts donations via a few payment methods

=== Shared Debt Ledger ===
* {{aaronpk}}
** created a website to track debt between roommates in college
** if A owes B, and B owes C, then that can transfer to A owes C
** only works because everyone trusts each other to reconcile at the end of the month

=== How do you decide what to charge for or accept donations ===
* {{aaronpk}}
** because I have a full time job, I don't *need* to make money from the other efforts like indieweb apps, so I am happy to just accept donations for them
** if I didn't have a job, I would look for ways to actually charge for some of them in some way

=== Web Payments ===
* API to collect credit card information
* https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/
* https://indieweb.org/payment
