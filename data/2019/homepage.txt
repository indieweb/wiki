'''<dfn>2019/homepage</dfn>''' is a project to update the IndieWeb community homepage in 2019, in particular with a three column layout designed for onboarding three common sets of visitors and new IndieWeb community members.

== Goals ==
* Make the onboarding flow a bit more direct and action oriented
* Reduce the number of alternatives and the cognitive load that goes with them
** <blockquote>And even for me the getting started guide was kind of mind blowing. The reason is: along the reading I was overwhelmed with alternatives.&mdash;[https://dem.cx/2020/02/01_we-need-the-no-brainer-indieweb/ Amani Mena] on 2020-02-01</blockquote>
* ...

== Steps ==
Start collecting various key / informative steps to design & implement a three column onboarding design:
* Copy and expand from [[2018/NYC/Organizers#Homepage_Updates_.28Three_Paths.29]]
* list micro.blog as a get started now option
* ...

=== Three Main Options ===
* All Users - turnkey setup, Get Started with micro.blog
* Existing [[CMS]] users - WordPress, Drupal
* Developers - [[SSG]], setting up a new CMS (Known, Drupal, WordPress), DIY

Sample three column starting approach:

{|border="1" cellpadding="5" class="remote-links" width="100%" style="max-width:100%;text-align:center;border-collapse: collapse;"

* Example of a minimal 3 column layout from a stylistic perspective (more than a semantic one) that may have CSS that can be re-used but with IndieWeb colors: https://rebellion.earth/
* Example onboarding path for two different audiences: https://arduboy.com/quick-start/, quick tutorial on getting set up https://arduboy.com/download-and-learn-arduino/,  at the bottom, three options: "How did it go"? "Not so great" "I’m ready to start coding!" "I’m ready to download some games!"

* Another 3-ish column design of options to choose from, some aspects which overlap with IndieWeb choices: https://www.netlify.com/pricing/
