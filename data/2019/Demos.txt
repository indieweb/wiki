== Flaki ==
* https://flak.is
* conversation yesterday about [[static site generators]] and how they send webmentions
* it's nice that we have {{aaronpk}} (and not selling our data?)
* dug into webmention.io saw it was mysql, wanted to see what could be done for storage
* want to make sure webmention / stored data is private
* how can you store state on the internet that is free as in beer, but also private?
* ended up at [[IPFS]]
* lets you store data in the swarm
* as long as you're the only one with the private key, your data can be stored on others computers and only you can access it
* how about using Indie Box to host your site, but as a peer in IPFS to help out the community
* things to ponder and discuss

== Jack Jamieson ==
* {{jackjamieson}}, https://jackjamieson.net/
* [[Yarns]] will try to find all feeds on a site
* shows split screen. Left side is old code, right side is newer.
* clicks search on left side, going slowly; clicking search on right side and it's already found the feeds
* finally the left side catches up
* new one is faster and finds more feeds (tantek.com has multiple h-feeds)
* worked with David Bryant on webmentions, found an issue with his site. The reply-context was coming through in post content. edited theme to fix it.

== Mime Cuvalo ==
* https://nite-lite.net/
* Worked on interop with [[Mastodon]], [[Friendica]], [[gnusocial]], [[webzilla]], [[pleroma]] 
* Started with Mastodon, got a [[like]] and [[reply]] to work
* Other sites were more difficult, especially Friendica

== Aaron Parecki ==
* {{aaronpk}} https://aaronpk.com
* at {{cleverdevil}}'s request, made small change to [[Aperture]]
* can now name your feeds
* nameless feeds now shortened to their domain name, e.g. long [[granary]] URLs
* live demo posting from [[Quill]]
* colorful backgrounds based on hex color as hashtag

== Tantek Ã‡elik ==
* {{t}} https://tantek.com
* thought he'd be working on reply contexts but went down a rabbit hole, needed to re-think UX
* currently shows a very minimal reply context "reply to a tweet"
* no icon for person or idea what they said
* github reply context shows issue number and title (documented on github)
* RSVP to gRegor's event doesn't know it's an event so just says "gregorlove.com's post"
* planned to use [[XRay]] at post time to preview reply-context
* where should the reply-context be stored? Marty suggested sidefile, since it's not your content
* decided to document issues with reply-context. Person's name could be "wrong", their URL, location, or some phrase
* opened an Xray issue to do original post discovery

== Jordan ==
* https://mjordan.codes
* worked on some design systems on her Storyboard
