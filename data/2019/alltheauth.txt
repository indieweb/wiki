== Notes ==
{{GWG}} narration: First, there were private webmentions, and they were good. Then came Server Indieauth, and it was also good....then came AutoAuth...and it is here now.

* This has been a long ongoing discussion proposal for a while. 
* [[private webmention]] worked well for individual posts but not for an entire feed
* [[AutoAuth]] is the latest iteration. It's been built and demo-ed at IWCs by a few people.
** Let some other thing act as you while fetching content, so would work for private feeds and private webmentions
* AutoAuth:
