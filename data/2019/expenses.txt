== Summary ==
Summarizing some of the sources of expenses, especially those specific to Summit:
* captioning
* ...

== Sponsored Expenses ==
Some "expenses" were fully covered directly by sponsors (in paranthese) and thus weren't actual expenses that the organizers had to account for:
* pre-party social snack&drink tickets at Pine Street Market (Name.com)
* day 1 coffee & breakfast, day 2 coffee & breakfast & lunch (Mozilla)
* afterparty at Voicebox (Okta)
* ...

Direct sponsorship of [[IndieWebCamp]] meals is something we have done historically and how we have afforded to do so. 

See [[how-to-sponsor]] for how to help out with future IndieWebCamps!
