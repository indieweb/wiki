== Notes ==
* does putting data publiclly mean that it should be mine-able by Facebook-esque companies?
* we seem to draw the line at the analyzing of your data to show you things, to influence your behavior/consumption (the collection has to be accepted if you want to participate in online culture)
* is the indieweb deliberately making data available to surveillance capitalism? distributed data mining?
* does making data available to all make it less valuable to data miners? data is valuable when it belongs to only facebook?
* Example: a person would like a CV online (it's very necessary in this world). But it can be consumed by data brokerage systems. 
* Indieweb is about what you've CHOSEN to share with others. It is a deliberate act. But some of that data will be usable by data miners. Less effective perhaps, but still minable.Inv
* Invisble Inc. (game recommendation): represents a future where corporations have become the de-facto source of power, which looks like where we're headed if we can't use policy and population awareness to take some control back of our data
* Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson (oh my god everyone read this book IT IS AMAZING).
* We should be encouraging the slow web. Low technology solutions. 
* We shoulda all be supporting privacy organisations like Mozilla. 
* The indieweb should be political and should take a stance on the broader issues e.g. we should be advocating to nation states to restrict the power of Facebook and co. 
* We should put these political views on our webpages. 
* Book: Who Owns The Future, by Jaron Lanier (and also You're Not A Gadget from him)
* Creative Commons-like granular control over individual pieces of data (i.e. “Here's my gender and sexual preference, which you cannot use for commercial purposes“)
* In some countries, there are components of your personal data that can't be stored or analyzed (e.g. in France you're not allowed to store or process the political views of users of a system)
