Session: Storing + Sharing Bookmarks<br>

== Notes ==
Session suggested by Mark, key points:
* What is bookmarking in relation to the indieweb?
* How can IndieWeb help with bookmarking?
* What are the long term plans for bookmarks?
* Never used Delicious, Pinboard is too minimalistic. Would like to keep bookmarks on a server (rather than a specific device in his possession)
* Wants to know: 
** How do you deal with bookrmarks
** Annotaions?
** Metadata around the bookmarks?

See:
* [[Shaarli]],
* [[projects#Shaarli]]
* [[bookmark]]

Possible solutions: 
* Sharrli: https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli - has a REST API and browser extensions
* Urlist: https://github.com/urlist/urlist → a now defunct service for bookmarking, creating lists/groups of bookmarks, and then sharing them with others (and they can “remix” and “follow” the list)
* Wallabag - Peter Molnar's post on moving to Wallabag(https://petermolnar.net/making-things-private/)
* https://www.ghacks.net/2018/01/11/mozilla-starts-to-publish-pocket-code/ ?
* probably some wordpress plugin?
    
Interesting overlap between:
* saving links
* https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/shaarli/
* read it later
* [[Indiepaper]]
* https://www.wallabag.org/en
* sharing links
    
Other services:
* https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/bookmarks (Not IndieWeb friendly, but "own your own data" friendly)
    
== Ideas ==
* A IndieWeb bookmarking service which queries your site (via MicroPub).
** Problem: MicroPub doesn't support a query for post type yet. 
** Need to support querying for post kinds, to be able to retrieve this information.

Like vs Heart vs Love vs Favourite?

Annotations
* [[fragmention]] - mentioned as a option

I suggested that we have a session tomorrow to add minimal IndieWeb support to Shaarli, either as a plugin or core feature https://shaarli.readthedocs.io/en/master/Plugins/

I think it makes more sense as a core feature but if they reject it plugin might be an alternative.

* http://curatorscode.org/ = symbols for via / hat tip / attribution. Yes, but the site is dead.
As detailed at my post https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/rip-the-curators-code
