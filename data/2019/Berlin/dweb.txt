* We can publish okay, but we still end up relying on twitter for reading content, because RSS was effectively killed off
* Indieweb is essentially based on governance at the DNS level then?

=== Difference Between DAT and DNS Approaches ===
* One of the motivations behind the distributed web is security: having your identity tied to a key instead of the DNS system or an account on someone else's server.
* Some of the people building these alternative tools to the internet, seem to assume it won't be there in 20 years. However, notice that a lot of people are in it, in very remote regions.
* The indie web is built on top of existing technology. dat:// websites need a specific app to access, and other distributed solutions have  the same condition.

Tor is an even lower level transport, like ssb for sample - you can run an indie web site without a domain name.

So like the web, things like Dat were designed for academic sharing, so governance - does the same thing of a
