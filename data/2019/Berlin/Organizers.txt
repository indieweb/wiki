== Etherpad Notes ==
* https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2019-Berlin-Organizers

== What ==
Renewed from [[2018/Berlin]]:

* {{t}} suggestion reading/viewing BEFORE the meetup:
** everything linked from this section "[http://microformats.org/wiki/mailing-lists#Why_to_avoid_negative_behaviors Why to avoid negative behaviors]" from the microformats wiki
*** especially Kathy Sierra article and Google Videos about dealing with poisonous people

* {{t}} consider BEFORE meetup, discuss at meetup:
** should IWCs have red and yellow lanyards for no photo, or ask before taking photo?
*** this might result in that interesting scenario that while the meeting itself was quite diverse, the photos will not reflect it, should people exclude themselves from the pictures, and I remember this being a trouble point with indieweb when it popped up on Twitter as a topic. I definitely don't like random photos taken about me, but I'd very much encourage participating in at least a group picture - {{petermolnar}}

* {{t}} consider IWC Organizer kits with:
** stickers (IWC, mf, webmention, etc.)
** pins (IWC, mf, pronoun)
** nametags (ideally HELLO MY URL IS)
** red / yellow lanyards for no photo or ask before taking
** ... if this is a good idea, create a separate page for it (linked from [[Organizers]]) and make a checklist, and/or way to order (some/most) these things as a set)

* {{t}}
** What did we think we did right / better / worse compared to last year?
** What did we leave open / unresolved from [[2018/Berlin/Organizers]]?
** What new community challenges have we encountered since?
** What are the most important things we can do to improve the community in the coming uyear?
** Which of those are the easiest / most scalable?
* Remaining/ongoing tasks from [[2018/Berlin/Organizers#Task_List]]
* ...

* {{t}} 
**  we should re-evaluate the [[generations]] page (again) at the Organizers meetup
** It's becoming increasingly imprecise, inaccurate, misleading, and perhaps even alienating and we need to fix that ASAP
