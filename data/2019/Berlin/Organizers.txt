== Etherpad Notes ==
* https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2019-Berlin-Organizers

== What ==
Renewed from [[2018/Berlin]]:

* {{t}} suggestion reading/viewing BEFORE the meetup:
** everything linked from this section "[http://microformats.org/wiki/mailing-lists#Why_to_avoid_negative_behaviors Why to avoid negative behaviors]" from the microformats wiki
*** especially Kathy Sierra article and Google Videos about dealing with poisonous people

* {{t}} consider BEFORE meetup, discuss at meetup:
** should IWCs have red and yellow lanyards for no photo, or ask before taking photo?
*** this might result in that interesting scenario that while the meeting itself was quite diverse, the photos will not reflect it, should people exclude themselves from the pictures, and I remember this being a trouble point with indieweb when it popped up on Twitter as a topic. I definitely don't like random photos taken about me, but I'd very much encourage participating in at least a group picture - {{petermolnar}}

* {{t}} consider IWC Organizer kits with:
** stickers (IWC, mf, webmention, etc.)
** pins (IWC, mf, pronoun)
** nametags (ideally HELLO MY URL IS)
** red / yellow lanyards for no photo or ask before taking
** ... if this is a good idea, create a separate page for it (linked from [[Organizers]]) and make a checklist, and/or way to order (some/most) these things as a set)

* {{t}}
** What did we think we did right / better / worse compared to last year?
** What did we leave open / unresolved from [[2018/Berlin/Organizers]]?
** What new community challenges have we encountered since?
** What are the most important things we can do to improve the community in the coming uyear?
** Which of those are the easiest / most scalable?
* Remaining/ongoing tasks from [[2018/Berlin/Organizers#Task_List]]
* ...

* {{t}} 
**  we should re-evaluate the [[generations]] page (again) at the Organizers meetup
** It's becoming increasingly imprecise, inaccurate, misleading, and perhaps even alienating and we need to fix that ASAP

== Etherpad ==
* [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2019-05-03 IRC notes]
* https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2019-Berlin-Organizers

Ideas from this page and from [[Organizers#Issues]] were listed in the etherpad and then sessions were put in a rough priority, or given an explicit time slot.

== Participants ==
* {{calumryan}}
* {{jgmac1106}}
* {{tantek}}
* {{gwg}}
* {{yulia}}

== Discussion ==
=== Photo Policy ===
* Need a clear photo policy - {{tantek}}
* previous IWCs / years:
** https://indieweb.org/2018/Berlin/Organizers#Lanyards_for_Photo_Preference

== Notes ==
* [https://2018.xoxofest.com/inclusion xoxo inclusion policy]

What went well this year compared to last year

=== What we can do better ===
* we still need
** better name tags (re-usable / My URL is)
** photo permission lanyards (or large red & yellow stickers as a backup)
** pronoun pins (supply for each city's local organizer to hold onto)
** more IndieWebCamp and microformats stickers (need supply for local organizer ahead of time)
** large postits in advance (~30 large stickies should be fine)
* [[IndieWebCamp Organizing]] should clarify "local organizer" requirements - so they know they have to get / order things in advance

== Tasks ==
* ✅ Technical set up with a tutorial from our host's IT person Ricardo
* ✅ badges(yulia - badges will be created by security)
* ✅ stickers (yulia)
* ✅ Lanyards for photo preference disclosure - No Lanyrds for this camp. Discussed but unable to address in time. Should work on for Summit. In lieu, using the 2018/Berlin system of red outline drawn on badge. Please add to: https://indieweb.org/2019/Organizers#What accordingly
* ✅ Did not bring collection of pronoun pins. Preferred pronouns to be written on badges by participants.
* ✅ Confirm photographers {{t}} and {{yulia}}
* ✅ Start /2019/Berlin/Introductions with template and conclusions from ^^^ previous tasks (tantek)

* ✅ Signage for helping people find the place (Calum) >> emailed to Yulia
* ✅ Add lunches to the schedule place (Yulia)
* ✅ Pick up office supplies

** Use hangouts and air to record --> David is responsible for his room

== Next Tasks ==
* ✅ Organizers meetup photo!
* ✅ Accessibility statement. Applicable to all events there should be an accessibility statement for both IWC and HWCs - for example see BTConf https://beyondtellerrand.com/accessibility - and link to it from /accessibility (Calum) Creating example specific to Berlin 2019 venue https://indieweb.org/2019/Berlin#Accessiblity
* ✅ Draft inclusivity statement for review - e.g. explicitly noting that IWC event itself does not serve/provide alcohol. See also https://2018.xoxofest.com/inclusion  How about that we are also family and child friendly? https://indieweb.org/inclusivity_statement (noted that it needs review)
** some folks will not attend an event if there is any availability of alcohol because of the increased possibility of harrassment
** should we rename "Homebrew" Website Club because of possible beer/alcohol-related connotations that may be discouraging folks?
*** [ ] needs (more and better) tito instructions {{Zegnat}}
* ✅Photo and video/live streaming  permissions wiki page draft - link to it from [[CoC]] and https://indieweb.org/photography_policy
