== Notes ==
[[IndieAuth]] is written on top of oAuth 2 so we didn't have to reinvent everything. It's mostly an extension on how to find endpoints. Your website will advertise your authorization endpoint. Using an http header or a "rel" in your website.
Core problem: I have a website, I want to use that website as my identity. And I want to use my website for authorization.

[[selfauth]] is an indieauth implementation https://github.com/Inklings-io/selfauth

similar space as [[OpenID]] but openid only does authentication, not authorization

Open question, Why not [[Webfinger]]?
* webfinger doesn't allow resources on subpages example.com/sonny (only top level domain or subdomain)
See https://indieweb.org/WebFinger (makes sense, I had similar concerns)
