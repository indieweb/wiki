== Notes ==
* Business Options for POSSE and PESOS, not just individual ones to introduce syndication to all types of users
** every ninth post on Instagram is an ad
** you can mute stories from advertisers
* Chat Bots, SMS, etc
* Moving from Posts to 'Stories' time limited posts
* Instagram issues with aspect ratio
* Swarm doesn't adjust the aspect ratio
* POSSE and PESOS
* Why not Archive everything digital if there is no space constraint?

=== Places we want to syndicate to ===
* Facebook Pages (which is still possible)
* Google - My Business
* Whatsapp (https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-gowhatsapp) - https://indieweb.org/WhatsApp#How_to_POSSE
* Pinterest (maybe has an API for this)
* Pinboard
** How do we build the alternatives to the service and just syndicate to those?

=== Features People Want ===
* [[on this day]] (reminding people of stuff)
* [[Google Photos]] can use AI and group photos by people

=== Why keep long term archives and syndications ===

He wrote down when and where he found them and how much he paid.</blockquote>
