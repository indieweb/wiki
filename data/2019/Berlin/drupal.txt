== Notes ==
in the same way that wordpress was a blogging tool, and django was a framework

[[Drupal]] started as a more general CMS. It had content types, between the two 

WP biased towards individuals

Drupal much more common in larger orgs

Infamous for it's learning curve 

Drupal - historically been easy to start with, until you're invested before you realise how much you're in

One module by a this guy Chris Dehaer - https://twitter.com/swentel

The drupal modules rely on quite a lot of developer expertise - the indieweb module by Kristof
* see [[Drupal#IndieWeb_Tools]]

it's a collection of smaller modules

Build in webmention coverage (webmentions are bit like) - push AND pull

endpoint to receive pings at /webmention

also pushes to the appropriate service for you, like twitter, fediverse, etc.

Is represented internally in the drupal db, rather than 

https://webmention.io/

You can set it up so webmentions, from other sites get automatically converted into content, and you get to 

https://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/building-your-wordpress-community/trackbacks-and-pingbacks/

Things to love
* Lots of flexibility, authoring experience allows for a decent amount of embedding semantics in.

Thing to not love
* Theming in drupal is still not much fun
