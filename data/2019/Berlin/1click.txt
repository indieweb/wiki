== Notes ==
David demos starting with a completely new WP install, and getting started indieweb
1. Install IndieWeb plugin -> gives you an IndieWeb menu item (left hand menu, other IndieWeb plugins usually put their settings pages in here)
2. IndieWeb settings
** Author settings, default author (WP doesn't set a default author)
** Setting up your social profiles
** IndieWeb Widgets
*** Rel Me
*** Author Profile H-card Widget
** Install IndieAuth and MicroPub plugins - can then post through Quill (quill.p3k.io)
** WordPress (IndieWeb Wiki): https://indieweb.org/WordPress
** MicroPub Clients (IndieWeb Wiki): https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients

** Webmentions lets your WP site accept webmentions, semantic linkbacks does the parsing and formatting (makes it look pretty)

** IndieWeb plugins do not (yet) support Gutenberg, Post Kinds does not support it at all, other plugins such as Simple Location do. 
*** So do we add install Classic Press to the directions?
*** Also should note not installing the mincroformats2 plugin?

=== Post Kinds ===
Lets you post all the different kinds of posts, without making you do all the markup by hand.

=== Syndication ===
Plugin: syndication links

Let's you add links to each post to where you have posted the same content elsewhere

Can also syndicate to other places (e.g. Twitter) using brid.gy

=== Simple Location ===
Shows your location, if the plugin was not installed/activated at the time of the post it only shows the co-ordinates. Editing the post will look up the name.
Privacy: Can set a zone, which will show a custom name for a radius around co-ordinates.
Can use a variety of providers for weather, location name and map data.

=== Integrating with Social Networks ===
Bridgy can send things elsewhere and get replies to that back.
OwnYourGram and OwnYourSwam allow you to get things posted on Instagram and Swarm - these sites don't let you support posting via an API
