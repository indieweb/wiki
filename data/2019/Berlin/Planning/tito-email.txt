<pre>Hi {{ first_name }}!

We’re looking forward to seeing you soon at [IndieWebCamp Berlin 2019](https://indieweb.org/2019/Berlin)! Here’s what you can look forward to for the next few days.

## Spring is on a break…

The forecast this weekend predicts it will reach a max of 8 to 12 degrees Celsius (46–54 Fahrenheit). Be sure to pack a sweater!

## Impromptu Friday socialising

Those who arrive early often try and coordinate something for Friday night. We expect this to be no different this time around! Have a look at [the event schedule](https://indieweb.org/2019/Berlin/Schedule#Friday) later today to see if any specific plans have already formed. Otherwise it is usually easy to find someone [through our discussion channels](https://indieweb.org/discuss).

## Saturday

The doors open at 9:30am on Saturday! Please arrive promptly so we can get you checked in and ready to start the day!

* Time: Saturday at 9:30am
* Location: [Mozilla Berlin](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/berlin/). GSG-Hof Schlesische Straße, Building 3, 3rd Floor, Schlesische Straße 27, 10997 Berlin, Germany

Feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions, or reach out through the previous mentioned [discussion channels](https://indieweb.org/discuss). See you soon!
