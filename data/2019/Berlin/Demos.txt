* Rose added icons to her site, added a permalink, and went grey
* Martijn has a lot of info in his profile.

== Sonny ==
* no website yet
* Spent the day thinking about a domain. And finally decided to code the site without having a domain
* Wrote a very simple WIP [[IndieAuth]] implementation being tested with [[Omnibear]] (web extension for Firefox)
* Then nothing happens as website not online

== Chris Adams ==
* http://blog.chrisadams.me.uk
* Shows how he has created an issue against a WP plugin for greenness checking – to see if they can come up with a good automated scheme
* Now showing code that takes a domain name and will show whether it is known to be green
* Also worked on a tool that does a trace on the domain, following all the hops. Giving people a better idea of infrastructure
* “Most of the internet runs on coal right now”
* His projects are on GitHub for people to help with

== Ian Forrester ==
* https://cubicgarden.com
* Came in late today, and went on to try IndieAuth
* Showing the IndieAuth flow starting at indieauth.com, but it ends in an error when approving access
* Also added the Green Web Foundation badge to his site

== Calum Ryan ==
* {{calumryan}}, https://calumryan.com
* did not do “anything inovative” this time
* Added an exra field for alt attribute on photos, and it should also go out to Twitter through bridgy
* Implemented part of the map for his events page
* Should have both upcoming and previous events, possible option to add coverage of said events
* Relaunched indiewebguides.org

* Another Green Web Foundation badge! And a big “yes” from Chris!
* Build a new Python implementation from scratch to do IndieAuth, because he couldn’t find another Python implementationg
* Shows how he can sign in to the wiki

== Caspar ==
* http://glueckpress.com
* He “installed all the things”
* Worked on including the author h-card on his site, got it added to his footer
* Then worked on a PR to an IndieWeb WordPress plugin to get the plugin to use an actual template file
* Which means you can now overwrite the default from the plugin from your own theme, where the HTML should probably live anyway
* Got his photo to show on the indie [[RSVP]] on 2019.indieweb.org/berlin
* Custom WP plugin he used, from #indieweb-wordpress: https://gist.github.com/glueckpress/23549f9d381f16c1114c7887de77f063

== Sebastian Greger ==
* {{sgreger}}, https://sebastiangreger.net/
* Showing his site, running on WordPress, but he is in the process of moving to [[Kirby]]
* The problem is missing out on the indieweb plugins’ functionality
* There was [[webmention]] code for the previous version of Kirby, but nothing for the new version 3
* He has been working on a new webmention flow
* Decided to split into two separate plugins: sending webmentions, and incoming webmentions (and comments)
* Live test of creatng a post with a link to a [[webmention.rocks]] test page
* It showed up on Webmention Rocks! Success!
* The Kirby backend will also show URLs it has sent mentions to
* Build a comment form for the posts as well, which is not something Kirby offers
* Has a comment moderation feed behind that, where he will need to manually approve comments first
* Incoming webmentions (should be the same as people leaving comments on the page) but were trickier
* Incoming webmentions are made to be processed asynchronously
* Shows how a webmention has now shown up in the same moderation queue!
* (Aside: it also pings archive.org)
* Just an hour ago it worked for the first time after weeks of work

== Jan Dinter ==
* http://jandinter.net - now has an h-card
* he also played with the styling to get a little easter egg going!

== David Shanske ==
* {{GWG}}, https://david.shanske.com
* Has been working on the IndieAuth WP plugin to give a better experiences
* You can now create tokens in the WP back-end with any arbitrary scopes you may want to add
* Also added bulk actions, which lets you expire tokens en masse
* Worked on including the authorization header checking script as a more native part of WP
* Showing what happens when the Authorization header is missing: which includes the lines you may need for htaccess

== Tantek Çelik ==
* {{t}}, https://tantek.com
* showing how his website is no longer matrix style (as during intros)
* but back to normal. But there is now a quick icon you can click if you want to get it back
* this is using a class and css variables
* This makes it easy to add new styling over time
* Now looking into how the style can keep being applied to all permalinks within the site

== Peter Molnar ==
* {{petermolnar}}, https://petermolnar.net/
* showed Flickr syndication links
* showed the dark/light theme support (that will follow along with your OS settings)
