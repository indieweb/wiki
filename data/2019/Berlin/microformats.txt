== Notes ==
* Easy way to make information you are already publishing (in HTML) machine readable / parse to a standardised JSON output
* Micro is for the minimal amount of effort required to add it. And the minimal vocabulary, for the 80/20 support. (It is good enough for 80% of the cases.)
* Parsers for many languages: https://microformats.io/
* Vocabularies have their own specs. http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry
** Vocabs are evolving constantly, see also http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#change_control
* Showing https://vanderven.se/martijn/ as an example of lots of different types of properties, including draft properties, and completely made up properties
* Examples of microformats consumers: readers, comments
