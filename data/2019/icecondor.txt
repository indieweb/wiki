Use Case:

FWIW, Micah and others had difficulty getting things working with PhoneTrack. Micah was able to get it all working with the [[Owntracks]] app following the directions here: https://github.com/icecondor/api/wiki/Rest-API#owntracks-android

PhoneTrack fix: in Settings, turn on Gps and Network. (it was gps only and no gps reception in the room)
