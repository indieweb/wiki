== Notes ==
# Think about “emerging signals of change” in our groups. Exploring possible futures for IndieWeb. Using those possible futures to reflect on the present.
#* STEEPV (Social, Technological, Environmental, Economic, Political, Values) 
# cluster these signals as they seem related. pick 3 of these signals from the various clusters.
# Assign your team one of these “Four Futures”:
#* Growth (status quo basQAQically continues)
#* Collapse (good or bad!)
#* Discpline (chosen vs imposed)
#* Transformation (profound historical change as occurred)
# Looking at the three signals of change chosen in #2, applied to these different types of futures, brainstorm 5-7 primary implications of that future and then pick 2 or 3 of those and generate 5-7 secondary implications (of the implications).

Headlines from the Future

Discipline:
* Surveillance capitalism runs rampant as big tech becomes pseudo governments
* Facebook police capture public enemy number 1, notorious indie web hacker; huge trove of illegal cash confiscated
* Indie Web made illegal, facebook cites unprofitability

Collapse:
* Collapse of capitalism leads to hyperlocal smaller collaborative societies
* The long now clock finally unveiled
* Sally's cat pooped on your roof

Growth: arc of history bends toward justice
* Gazion: send money to performers in real time just by looking at them: buionic contact lenses allow you to visually send money with your own eyes
* Wealth gap eliminated thanks to government anti-bias program
* heads of equifax and axiom jailed for flagrant violations of data sovereignty act

Transformation: protecting against abuse
* median life expectancy hits record high
* local economies support mental health

Reflections
