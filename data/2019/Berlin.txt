IndieWebCamp Berlin 2019 is the '''fifth in Berlin''', happening the weekend before the [https://indieweb.org/2019/Düsseldorf Düsseldorf IndieWebCamp 2019] and [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2019 beyond tellerrand // BERLIN 2019]. One of many [[IndieWebCamps]]!

<div class="e-content">
IndieWebCamp Berlin is an '''all-levels''' BarCamp-like collaboration in Berlin for '''two days''' of keynotes, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping '''gain more control over our data and lives online'''!

Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and – maybe more importantly – encourage all users to own their own content and identities.

Bring your laptop and mobile devices, we’ll help you get setup to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!

* 2019-05-06…08 [https://19.re-publica.com/en re:publica19] in Berlin! <blockquote>Once again and IRL3 we will bring together a diverse group of people from all over the world: the digital society. We will talk, we will debate, we may argue; but more than ever, we will go IN DEPTH. Because things are complicated. Things are complex. Things need to be thought through, discussed and looked at from different angles. This is why we are dedicating the next re:publica to the long read, the small print, the footnotes; to the power of research, the power of controversy and the urgency not to simplify the issues that divide (or unite!) us.</blockquote>
