IndieWebCamp Berlin is an '''all-levels''' BarCamp-like collaboration in Berlin for '''two days''' of keynotes, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping '''gain more control over our data and lives online'''!

Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and â€“ maybe more importantly â€“ encourage all users to own their own content and identities.

Bring your laptop and mobile devices, weâ€™ll help you get setup to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!
