<code><b><nowiki>Subject: IndieWeb Summit is just around the corner!</nowiki></b></code>

<pre><nowiki>
Hello {{ first_name }}! Only a few days before we all come together for IndieWeb Summit! I am very much looking forward to the week, and hope you all have a fantastic time while you're in Portland.

We are about to sell out! If you know someone who was thinking about participating, tell them to register quickly to grab one of the few remaining tickets!

If you can't make it, please click the "View Ticket" link at the bottom of this email and cancel your ticket. This will ensure your spot is opened up for someone else who wants to attend!

Here are a few details before we meet. You'll probably want to save this update so you can refer to it as you make your way to Portland for the festivities.

## Code of Conduct

As a reminder, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct) that applies to IndieWeb spaces both online & in-person, and our events hosted by Mozilla Portland also have [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.

## Join the Chat

If you haven't already, join our [Slack](https://chat.indieweb.org/slack) or [IRC channel](https://indieweb.org/discuss) (they're connected) and introduce yourself! We'll be using the chat during the event to take notes, share links, and communicate with the remote participants.

## Weather 

It looks like we'll have some pretty great weather, much less hot than last year! The [forecast](https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/or/portland?cm_ven=localwx_10day) is showing a high of 79 and low of 54, with a chance of rain Wednesday and Thursday but dry the rest of the week.

## Breakfast and Lunch

We will be providing vegan breakfast with vegetarian options on Saturday and Sunday mornings thanks to Mozilla. Coffee will be available all day as well!

Lunch on Sunday will be provided at the venue thanks to Mozilla, with vegan and vegetarian options. Saturday lunch will be on your own at any of the [nearby food carts](https://foursquare.com/aaronpk/list/alder-food-carts).

## Friday Pre-Party

On Friday evening, we'll be hosting a pre-party at [Pine Street Market](http://www.pinestreetpdx.com/) in downtown Portland starting at 5:30pm.

We'll have food and drink tickets available thanks to Name.com, and anyone is welcome to come to the pre-party!

Pine Street Market has a variety of food and drink options, including [burgers and veggie burgers](https://www.byhpdx.com/burgers/), [ramen](http://www.marukinramen.com/), [Korean street food](http://www.kimjongsmokehouse.com/), [pizzas](https://www.checkerboardpdx.com/), [tacos and arepas](http://www.teotepdx.com/), as well as [Salt & Straw ice cream](https://www.saltandstraw.com/wizbangbar).

## Getting Around

IndieWeb Summit will be hosted at Mozilla Portland at [1120 NW Couch St #320](https://goo.gl/maps/pK4YsfTooEoWjWpk6). The doors open at 9:00am on Saturday and Sunday ([complete schedule on the wiki](https://indieweb.org/2019/Schedule)). Once you enter the building, go up to the third floor, and you'll see the door for Mozilla.

### Public Transit

From the airport to downtown and getting around:

[TriMet](http://trimet.org/) runs the buses and light rail here. The cheapest way to get into town from the airport is to take the [MAX red line](https://goo.gl/maps/QrKGJs8qwVUsXkw99) which picks up at the airport and drops off at "Galleria/SW 10th" downtown. It's $2.50 for a 2.5 hour ticket or $5 for an all-day ticket.

There is a streetcar that runs [North/South along 10th and 11th Avenues](https://portlandstreetcar.org/schedules) that will drop off a couple blocks from Mozilla.

If your phone supports Apple Pay or Google Pay, you can just tap your phone to buy a Tri-Met or Streetcar ticket using the "Hop" readers at every stop! It's by far the easiest option. Make sure you tap your phone at the stop *before* boarding. You don't need to tap out when you get off. Otherwise, you can use a credit card or cash to buy a ticket at most MAX and Streetcar stops.

## Remote Participation

We will be providing remote participation facilities for people who couldn't join us in Portland this year. The main room will be set up for remote participation with cameras and screen sharing, and all the sessions will be recorded. The two breakout rooms will have a camera setup for remote participation as well. More information and the relevant links are [on the wiki](https://indieweb.org/2019#Remote_Participation).

## Related Events
