<pre><nowiki>
Hello {{ first_name }}! Only a couple more days before we all come together for IndieWeb Summit! I am very much looking forward to the week, and I hope you all have a fantastic time while you're in Portland.

Here are a few last details before we meet. You'll probably want to save this update so you can refer to it as you make your way to Portland for the festivities.

## Weather 

It looks like we'll have some pretty great weather, much less hot than last year! The [forecast](https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/or/portland?cm_ven=localwx_10day) is showing a high of 75 and low of 50, with a chance of rain Monday morning and dry the rest of the week. I'm looking forward to sharing Portland's nice weather with you in contrast to last year's 100+ degree days!

## Breakfast and Lunch

We will be providing bagels, fruit, and protein bars on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings thanks to Mozilla. Coffee will be available all day as well!

Lunch on Sunday will be provided at the venue thanks to Mozilla. We'll have a taco bar with gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options! Saturday lunch will be on your own at any of the [nearby food carts](https://foursquare.com/aaronpk/list/alder-food-carts).

## Friday Pre-Party

On Friday evening, we'll be hosting a pre-party at [Pine Street Market](http://www.pinestreetpdx.com/) in downtown Portland starting at 5:30pm. 

We'll have food and drink tickets available thanks to Name.com, and anyone is welcome to come to the pre-party!

Pine Street Market has a variety of food and drink options, including [burgers and veggie burgers](https://www.byhpdx.com/burgers/), [ramen](http://www.marukinramen.com/), [pizzas](https://www.checkerboardpdx.com/), ______________ as well as [Salt & Straw ice cream](https://www.saltandstraw.com/wizbangbar), [excellent coffee](http://www.baristapdx.com/brassbar/) and [fantastic cocktails](http://www.pollobravopdx.com/bar-pine/).

## Getting Around

IndieWeb Summit will be hosted at Mozilla Portland at [1126 SW Salmon St](https://goo.gl/maps/5Q7ubC5rGuR2). The doors open at 9:00am on Saturday and Sunday.

### Public Transit

There is a streetcar that runs [North/South along 10th and 11th Avenues](https://portlandstreetcar.org/schedules) that will drop off a couple blocks from the venue.

[TriMet](http://trimet.org/) runs the buses and light rail here. The cheapest way to get into town from the airport is to take the [MAX red line](https://goo.gl/maps/hKu7qZZinfz) which picks up at the airport and drops off at ______ downtown. It's $2.50 for a 2.5 hour ticket or $5 for an all-day ticket.

If your phone supports Apple Pay or Google Pay, you can just tap your phone to buy a Tri-Met or Streetcar ticket using the "Hop" readers at every stop! It's by far the easiest option. Make sure you tap your phone at the stop *before* boarding. You don't need to tap out when you get off. Otherwise, you can use a credit card or cash to buy a ticket at most MAX and Streetcar stops.

## Remote Participation

We will have people participating remotely who couldn't come to Portland this year! The main room will be set up for remote participation with cameras and screen sharing, and all the sessions will be recorded. The two breakout rooms will have a camera setup for remote participation as well. More information and the relevant links are [on the wiki](https://indieweb.org/2019#Remote_Participation).

## Related Events

### Donut.js

On Tuesday night, [Donut.js](https://donutjs.club/) is having their monthly meetup featuring a fun collection of talks! Despite the name, only one of this month's talks is actually about JavaScript.
