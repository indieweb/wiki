If you're not sure, ask an [[2019#Organizers|organizer]].

== Notes from previous years ==
See [[2018/Planning#Notes_from_previous_years]]
Notes from after 2017 IndieWeb Summit to keep in mind for this year

== Remote Viewing Party ==
Some people are thinking of meeting up in Europe to join remotely all from the same location. A bit like the previous [[2018#Berlin_Remote_Event|Berlin Remote Event]].

{{martijnvdven}} is able to run an event in Åmål in colaboration with [https://www.sv.se/avdelningar/sv-vast/ Studieförbundet Vuxenskola Väst]. SV is able to provide several rooms, internet connectivity, projector for remote viewing of [[2019|the main event]], and coffee and tea. The venue should be available to us all throughout the night, if desired.

'''Help wanted''' for planning and finalising an actual schedule!

(Possible trip to [http://dalslandsmooseranch.se/english/ the Moose Ranch] for guaranteed Moose petting!)

* {{rose}} would love to attend

=== Schedule ===

Suggestions for the schedule are welcome:
* {{rose}} suggests starting at lunchtime with local sessions/intros, and then progressing into the evening with remote viewing/participation in Portland.

== Archived Planning ==
Planning dates and venue possibilities for IndieWebSummit [[2019]] in Portland!

=== On-site Considerations ===
* food - vegetarian default
** we can order food in for day 2 if we want

=== Archived Todo ===
==== Todos moved to GitHub ====
* {{t}} URGENT: confirm whether there is ethernet available at Mozilla that the captionist can use. Need to confirm this in order to know whether they can broadcast the captions to a URL or only to a TV in the room.
** Have asked. May need to better understand what is the exact setup that the Ethernet is needed for? Is it being plugged into a laptop? Mirrored display? Something else?
** we will need somewhere the captionist can plug her laptop in to Ethernet as well as HDMI to one of the TVs. She also needs an audio feed from the main audio board, so probably somewhere near that is best, or maybe even inside the video control room. <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://aaronparecki.com/photo.jpg}} [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 07:19, 17 June 2019 (PDT)
* {{t}}: update [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp/lists/indieweb-summit-2019/members Twitter list of participants] from https://2019.indieweb.org/summit
* {{aaronpk}} Figure out and document [[remote participation]] so a volunteer can help with it!
* Figure out necessary RSVP fixes (to parsers, WordPress plugins, wiki pages, documentation) 
** e.g. https://myravery.me/2019/06/06/indieweb-summit-portland/
* update and send [[2019/Planning/update-email]] to registered attendees
* {{t}} Create and stub all redlinked wiki pages!
* document [[2019/expenses|expenses]]
* execute outreach plan focused on [[inclusivity]]

==== Done ====
* {{aaronpk}} Create "Remote Participation" section on [[2019]], starting with [[2018/#Participating]] and adding enough description/links to folks can sign-up, prepare their setups in advance (any software/testing needed etc.)
** Perhaps you can copy and past a bit from here: https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attendance#Technology
* Order lanyards and name badges
** we have red, yellow and black lanyards
** we have branded hanging nametags that we used for the previous two summits
* {{aaronpk}} T-shirts are ordered and will arrive in time for Summit
* {{t}} send out emails for travel scholarships
* {{t}},{{aaronpk}}: pick keynote speaker(s)
** 3 invited keynotes confirmed (+2 by {{t}}, {{aaronpk}}
