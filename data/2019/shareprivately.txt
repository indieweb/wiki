== Notes ==

Useful prior art:
* https://indieweb.org/private_posts

{{aaronpk}} has this feature in his CMS, and he implements it by having a post be flagged as private to specified domain names, which represent IndieWeb identities that can see the post if they IndieAuth. Problems with this approach:
* How to handle feeds?
* How to get the original URL of the private post?
* It requires the consumer to use IndieAuth, which they may not be able to
* {{sebsel}} supports this as well https://seblog.nl/2019/06/28/8/surf-the-web-at-lightning-speed with a very similar feature set.

[[group|Groups]] are another topic of interest, rather than having to specify a list of domains, you could theoretically create a group that could be reused, like “Family” or “Friends.”

How to share access to the content? Links could be emailed that allow access directly. A site could offer usernames and passwords for folks that cannot (currently) use [[IndieAuth]].

Notifications are a big challenge as well. How do you notify someone that content has been shared to them? {{beesbuzz.biz}} views this as the biggest challenge. 

* https://indieweb.org/private-webmention describes a method for notifying a site that there's a post that mentions them, and how to authenticate to get access to it site-to-site.

{{martymcguire}}: Seems to be all of these features are very tied to any given CMS, other than perhaps the concepts of a "Person" (with possible methods to automatically notify them of new posts they can see), and allowlists (for a given post to determine who can see it).

{{jackjamieson}}: Important to note what the attack vectors are that could compromise a private system - designing without those in mind likely to lead to problems

{{cleverdevil}}: For non-IndieWeb identities, email with magic links might be the best option. (Or other notification mechanisms such as Twitter DMs or whatever.)
* {{beesbuzz.biz}}: This still doesn't handle the use case of backfilling/archived content, though, or handling the follow vs subscribe dichotomy - [http://beesbuzz.biz/5709 post]

{{snarfed}} suggested “secret” links as an option as well. Not totally secure, but much simpler than alternatives.
