== Transcript ==
First, thank you, all, for giving me the opportunity
to speak up here with all of these other great
keynotes. Thanks for taking a chance on this.
And, thanks, in advance, for going on a journey
that's probably going to be a little bit weird
and intimate. 

Like, you're coming into how
I use the internet and I do that as much as
I can through building blocks that the IndieWeb
community has made, that in my -- I guess
three or four years of digging into IndieWeb
trying to understand it, trying to
build tools and things for myself, that I've
been able to sort of cobble together and I
think in some sense, Tantek is right. These
tools exist and once you've kind of plugged
the right things together, it works.

But in another sense, this is a very organic
thing that I have slowly accrued over time
and it has sharp edges. It has bruises. It
has bleeding edges.

Okay.

Welcome to my phone. Oh, gosh. All right.

I would like to start things off with some
posting. So, this is an app called Indigenous.
It's built by Eddie Hinkle. Like most of the things I use,
this is someone else's work. So Eddie, I hope
I'm not doing you wrong by showcasing this
here and how I happen to have learned how to use it.

I'm going to start with a photo post.
I want to thank Jacky for posing with me earlier.
Let's see, I'm excited to have an IndieWeb
Summit day. We'll get that sent off. And,
what this is doing, in the background, is
doing two uploads. One, it's sending that
photo off to a service I've built, that stores
media for me and just serves it back and the
other is actually making a post on my website.
So, we're going to let that post. It takes
about a minute. Meanwhile, I'm going to show
you the more interesting parts of Indigenous.

Indigenous is what we're calling an indie reader.

Nice, Jacky blowing it up over there.

A lot of folks, myself
included, like to say we miss Google Reader. You could
follow all the things you care about and nothing
else. Seeing it in a reverse chronological
timeline and one of the things that was missing
is the actual social aspects, being able to
do something with that. So, this is how Indigenous
shows my feeds.

I have a group called IndieWeb that are basically just people that I have learned of through events like this.

I think I like Jacky's post here. These are
being pulled from the feeds on peoples' sites.

I really thought there would be a photo there.

>> [Away from mic].

>> It's cool. You don't need to apologize.
I don't know why I called you out. This is
a nice mobile experience. This is an app,
it's native. You can see, at the bottom of
the screen, we have some options. These all
will actually create new posts on my site.

There's -- I will call Eddie out for this
a little bit. If you click the button, there's
very little feedback that anything happened.
In theory, a like is being made on my site
right now and will show up for Jacky later.
Let's see, I skipped a step here. So, posting
a photo. One thing we talk about on the IndieWeb
is POSSE. You post stuff on your site, but
most people don't read your site. I want to
take that photo that I just posted and also
put it on Twitter so we get some reach. So,
we're going to make a photo post. So excited
for an IndieWeb Summit Day. And this is one
of the kind of uglier parts of my personal site flow.

Other folks have automated this. I haven't. So I post to my site, I post to Twitter. If I want to
experience some of the cooler parts of the
IndieWeb, where things on -- oh, no. Oh,
y'all. My site might be broken now. This is
going to be very awkward. Cool. Here's what

I can do, we can go to some pre-cooked example
posts.

One of the most important things you can do
is post places where your community still
is. If that happens to be Twitter, you know,
also post things to Twitter and through tools
like Bridgy, which Tantek mentioned, you can
have responses come back. So, here's an example
of a post I put on my site. And if I click through the see also link,

It's also got a tweet. A lot of folks have asked questions
on Twitter, retweeted it and replied. Because
I have set up my site with Bridgy, I actually
get those back. So, we can see, a lot of these
are Twitter likes, reposts and then the actual
questions, themselves, come in as mentions.

If my website was working right now, we'd
be doing a live version of this. Trust me,
it sometimes works.

Since we're off the rails, let me check my
notes here. Um, right. The -- this reader
is great for following IndieWeb folks, but
I also use if for a lot of other stuff. I
don't use Instagram, but I have an Instagram.
I have a lot of friends that I follow on there
and through another tool, build by Ryan Barrett, called Granary, I'm able to take my Instagram feeds, pull them in through my reader and check them out
here and if there's something that I like,

I can like it on my site. If there's something
I want to reply to, I can do that on my site.

And if I want to do that on Instagram, as
well -- oh, yeah, let's see. It's one of
my pirate friends in Baltimore. I can look
at all this stuff without having to load up
Instagram. Without having to have Facebook
cook as tracking me around and it feels like
a little step more free. And, you know, it
takes some effort, but I think it's worth it.

Okay. With my site broken, I can't do these
things. But, I can get into some of the other
weirder stuff. One thing that is still very
bleeding edge is more exotic ways of posting.
There are wonderful tools. We'll look at Monocle
here. This is another piece of Aaron's work.
It's an indie reader that runs in the browser.

So I can use this instead of or in addition to a native app. It also has -- do we
have posting tools here? Oh, I like this very
much. I do like this very much.

[Laughter].

That one. That one gets a like. Maybe these
will show up some day. Gosh, what did I want
to do? It's really tough when you break your
website while you're trying to do a live demo.

Oh, that was it.

Right. I did -- I did myself a good thing
here. So, one thing I want to do, I was on
Good Reads and I wanted to stop. I built a
thing to post reads on my site and a lot of
this was inspired by Gregor, who built indiebookclub.biz.

But I thought it would be even faster if I could basically like post something I want to read from my phone. And this is where the work of Sebastiaan Andeweg and Rosemary Orchard came in handy.

If you have an iOS device, especially once iOS 13 comes out, you're going to want to play with shortcuts because this is where IndieWeb building blocks actually
come into your hands. You kind of have to
be the IndieWeb building block in order to
move things around. But, through some of their
work, I was able to create shortcuts that
can use the same IndieWeb building blocks --

Micropub -- to post to my site. I have shared
a GoodReads URL to my shortcut. It's asking
me whether I want to mark this as something I want to read, am reading, or finished reading.

I want to say it's to read. It's going to
create a Micropub post and off it went to
my site. The next time I get my site compiling,
it'll be up there and we can see -- /reads --
sorry. /tag/books. We can see, like, these
are things that I used to post to GoodReads,
but now I can track them all on my site. Other
folks on the IndieWeb can book club it up.
See what other folks are reading, try to read
things together.

One last thing I will show before I hop out
of here. That photo that Jacky and I took
is a live photo and this is where you get
into the kind of stuff that you can only build
when it's your website, like, this -- this
kind of thing is, like, new and hot on Boomerang
and apps you send to people and it disappears.

I like this little bouncy loop, so --

[Laughter].

I'm going to share it to my website. And,
I do that through another shortcut I made
called Live Photo to Micropub Video. It takes
that loop, let's you -- this is all part
of iOS so far. That was weird. Uploads it,
put a caption -- we're going to call this
the IndieWeb Dance, that's official now.

[Laughter].

And, it will post that to my site and I do have -- I have a pre-baked --

>> Can you make that face?

>> Make that same face?

[Laughter].

[Away from mic].

>> In a moment, yes. I can do this one.

[Laughter].

Oh, my hand. All right. So, to wrap this up
and not take too much of y'all's time --
dang, where did my notes go? I've lost them.
That's okay. We will -- going to my pre-baked demo.

Um, this is an example of what these look
like on my site. So, they -- they're little
looping videos that play silently. They animate
for one second. This is the kind of thing
that's pretty hard to put out and I find there's
a lot of creativity where if you're willing
to dig in and get your hands dirty and understand
these building blocks, which get easier months
by month, year by year, you can start to really
own your own experience. There are things
I can do now with my phone, with my website,
on the social web, that I would have never
imagined a few years ago and, if I lost
this, I'd be very sad.

We'll leave this there. Thanks very much.
