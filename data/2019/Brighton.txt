== Travel and Lodging ==
=== Airport ===
* ‚úàÔ∏è '''LGW Airport.''' London Gatwick is the better airport to fly into as it has a quick direct train connection to Brighton. Especially good for European visits.
* ‚úàÔ∏è '''LHR Airport.''' London Heathrow has more international connections and may be more convenient to fly into from overseas (like the U.S.).

=== Trains ===
* üöÉ '''From LGW airport''': Go to the South Terminal which is connected to the train station where you can buy a ticket to Brighton. The train will drop you off in downtown Brighton about a 15 minute walk from the venue. It costs ¬£10-20 for a ticket. [https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ National Rail] has all the timetables and costs. Advance tickets are cheaper, but require you to take a specific train.

* üöÑüöàüöÉ '''From the LHR airport''': There are a couple of options
** üöÑ Heathrow Express to London Paddington Station (faster ~15-20min, has wifi, pricier), OR
** üöà London Underground [https://tfl.gov.uk/tube/route/piccadilly/ Piccadilly line] to London Hammersmith (slower ~80-90min, cheaper)
** Then:
** üöà London Underground to Victoria, THEN
