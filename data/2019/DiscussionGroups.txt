== Notes ==

The original idea was for totally open discussion groups. Johannes Suggested Using whitelisting As An Option:

K: Want to get the level of conversation from the USENET era

Want to be able to have very open discussions, robust to threats like DDoS

DISCUSSION CONTINUED AROUND METHODS OF PREVENTION AGAINST ATTACKS, INCLUDING DOMAIN REDIRECING DOMSIN TO PROXY, ETC.

Jo: If I want to start a discussion, maybe I have an idea of the people I want to have participate, so I could whitelist them

Capture discussions from anywhere they happened (Twitter, whatever) to record what led up to a decision

What's the basic structure required to have a discussion?

What kind of user interface works for distilling conversations into summaries/conclusions that are traceable back to original messages?

UPDATE 7/1/2019:  Kevin Ferguson:
* Created new domain/site: complexmath.rocks with discussion board complexmath.rocks/discussion and installed Vanilla BB for discussion, which includes flood control for that type of DOS mitigation.
