* succeeded at first step: quietly successful & empowering & getting stuff done
* may not be perfect or optimal but we're making it work
* pioneers out in the woods: thriving, happy
* we're getting out of it the things we want out of it. (are we?)
* could live like that a long time
* should we eventually get to be in revolutionary mode
* a lot of people try to change the world, and they don't get the first step.
* indieweb has gotten a great first step which is noteworthy and extraordinary, that's good, but what's the next step in the journey, and how do we invest more in whatever it is going to take to get that next step happening.
* It's possible, but not necessarily easy, not pretty, but it works

* what are people looking forward to at summit?
* how to post on one's website in a more efficient, committed way, get over inertia of not fully expressing voice on the web
   
* Some hate twitter, some just don't tweet any more, but it's easy to tweet, just type a bunch of text and hit button on my mobile phone, and need to figure out a way to do that in an indieweb way.

* logging into an WP console and typing a bunch of stuff, and checking a bunch of boxes is just enough friction to keep many from doing it as often as they'd like, as often as they may have tweeted before twitter turned into a cesspool.
