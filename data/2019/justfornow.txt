== Notes ==
* Participate in the IndieWeb without defining your identity by having a site?
* GPDR- right to be forgotten - how do you get forgotten when your posts all got syndicated out all over the place?
* Maintaining multiple identities, like "fandom trash" versus "less trash"
* What do you do when you need to move your identity somewhere else? How do you move your identity from place to place. rel=me's can be flakey.
* IndieWiki requires a domain name. It used to allow OpenID but it switched to IndieAuth.

* Creators need to own their content. Can IndieWeb provide support or an easier way to begin to start making it easier for Creators to get started?
* Posts that are more ephemeral that exist on Patreon. If Patreon disappears, what happens to their content.
* A need to move content onto your own site.
* What is needed to own the space for your community?
* OAuth / Membership List (Patrons) = Patreon
* Community = Discourse
* Content/Distribution = i.e Podcast, Images

Solutions:
* Expiry dates in the protocol.
* Redirects from former domain to new domain
