== Transcript ==

This is something I've kind of toyed around
a little bit personally and it's one of the
core tenets of bringing the things we use
every day -- like, bring it to other people.

So, a little bit about me.

I'm a guy who lives in someplace people call
Nor Cal. I like to make things to help people, websites.

There's three things I want to touch on today.
It took me time to get these words together.
The first idea was around inspiration.
How do we take the things that
make us passionate and share them with people?

As shown before of Marty, there's things we
do that we find that's enjoying, that's liberating,
things that we can share with others, quirky, exciting.

There's a way to kind of encourage people
to come do the same. To do the same with our sites.

Not just to keep the door open, but
so we don't burn ourselves out trying to bring
every person in.

We can start reflecting and investigating
on the things that we know that are difficult
and reduce the barrier to entry, thus making
that doorstop something we copy and paste
and put in other places

Starting off with inspiration -- hold on,
I actually can't see my notes.
That's funny, because I know what I'm talking about.

Inspiration is organic.
It's something we come into.
We enjoy and expand on.

I guess, like, one thing to -- my personal --
I used to run a static site.

I enjoyed it, it gave me a chance to tinker and mold.
My site was clay, I could take it and mold
it and record it and share it with other people.

When it came to things I did on my site, I saw people doing more in-depth things.
They were capturing where they traveled to,
things they consumed -- I mean, if it can
be recorded, it can be captured and that led
to prove that this is something that can be
done not only all the time but also very simply.

And definitely, in this age, if it's a low-effort
and, like, a high return thing, we're going to jump
into it every single time.

So, there's a few ideas and things that I
will try to propose today and hopefully you
can lead to other conversations in our breakout sessions today.

One thing's always worked out is kind of giving
people a chance to manipulate data and see
how it's presented in realtime.

I'll going to start with Bonnie and Clyde.
So let's say Bonnie and Clyde were on the same social network
and they happen to be across the country.

Clyde sees a post about Bonnie breaking into Cay's Jewelers, we can manipulate and show
how the blocks can tie into other things.

This is a way of demonstrating a post that Clyde would make on his own site.
Each part proves that Clyde goes into there,
tying into how one person's identity on their
own site -- it could be something you post
somewhere else.

Each step can be demonstrated up and down here.
This is something I'm trying to work on, I'm pretty sure somebody has a better idea.
How do we show how content kind of moves around.
On some platforms you can see Clark liked Lewis' posts.

It could be one person who starts their site
and they invite two other people.
They start talking to each other and a person who is outside the network
then pulls another friend in and they start communicating.

The thing is, right now, for you to do this,
you have to click the post. If there is a way to easily
demonstrate how these things are shared, it would encourage people my content can travel.

I don't have to worry that it's trapped on my site, there's other places it can go to.

Visualizing how interactions spread across the web through the internet.

Yes, this is going to be a fun one.
You might see your self on here.
Also demonstrating how we present our own content on our own sites.

One thing we have the amazing luxury of
is not getting stuck in cookie-cutter presentations.

We're not some blue text on a random site.
We can demonstrate things how we want.
I can show you how people tend to reply to my site or how someone else may want to
check in at a place. Or short notes that people have on other sites.
And so on and so forth.

And it can be also you up here.
Each person is not constrained by whatever platform they have because the platform's
on their own definition.

In order to -- not only let people in, but
make them feel they can stay in the space
when they work on things.
We have to put tape on the floor.
Like this is the easy way but from here you can do other things.

One thing I try to personally point on other sites is to ensure it's always explained.
If you want to talk back, this is something
you can lead into.

Lead into other venues for anonymous identities and making it easier for people to kind of get into places, which is tying into invitations.

This is something I know, as somebody who
runs -- or used to run monthly dinners.
Inviting people to a place is always difficult.

And, trying to make it something that's easy
to automate, easy to copy, easy to run
it's always going to be hard.

If they tell you, I can't make it today or
when it comes to Homebrew Website Clubs, it's usually
oh I can't RSVP to the site because of X Y and Q
It's usually because of something that either we haven't
fully provided yet or a barrier.

We reach halfway, are we on the same kind
of road? Are we communicating from different paths?

This ties into -- the IndieWeb has a list of 12
principles --

>> [Away from mic].

>> Got you.

This is one that I've read over and over.

Whenever I try to do things, I do it for me,
but the most immediate people to my circle.

And working and building those two things together
are always kind of difficult for me.
Juggling how I can make something I can share with somebody and also pull in other people.
It's something I grew up with -- I'm the oldest of five.
So whenever I think of something it's how can I make sure it's me, and Christopher and Rebecca,
my siblings all can work together and [inaudible] all the time?

It's usually something I had to focus on it myself.

But it's not only me.
It's how we work together and get these things done.

The easiest way to go about this is advocacy.
We're advocating for a group of people to
help share these ideas and notions.

There is more anthropological approaches to get things done.

It can be as simple as writing documentation
that helps people understand what microformats
are or giving more -- I want to say, adjacent
tools and, like, templates for the things
that we need.

That's -- this is not a linear slide show.
Okay.

Which ties into understanding where people
are, we can then start working on the kind
of things that they run into.

So, sorry.
I'm going to fix that.

So, that things to tend to trip people up.

This is something I've run into personally, I had to fix my search history.
There is something called microdata, we don't necessarily use that.
You can if you want, but it won't work on most peoples' sites here.
This is one thing that comes up which is
people feel like there's nothing they can
pick up and work with.

There are solutions out there.
It's just not what they're looking for, which
is a chicken and egg situation.

We don't know what we can provide you with
if you don't tell us.
It's like, try this out so we can find some
kind of middle ground.

There is always this notion -- and it's well-founded
that the IndieWeb is tilted for people who like to look at 80 by 24 console screens
which is not entirely true.

There's a lot of people out there who do art who do music who put content in a platform like micro.blog
This is the magic slide.

Yes.

Oh, so, showstopper -- I use showstopper
here in quotations to highlight these are
things that if they can't find immediately,
they are like, this is not something I can use.

They don't have things that work for me.

Audience control is a very obscure way of saying
I want to have content on the web that's meant for you, you and you but noone else can access.
It's a very active topic in the IndieWeb right now terms of private posts and it's something that's --
there's no one-size-fits-all situations.

What might work for me, password-protected
posts may not work for somebody else.
Cause now you have to share this password so what does that actually mean in terms of security.

Are these together? Gosh. All right.
That's fine.

Ephemeral identities. Basically
Having the ability to kind of dispose information or how you present yourself in the world,
given that we are associative with DNS, it's hard to disappear because we also archive everything.

That's fine.

There was a middle slide about how kind of
things can be compartmentalized and we have
to look into a Bento Box solution for things.

Not necessarily to give everybody what they need.
We have to encourage that there are blocks
people can use to build themselves.
That ties into that idea of having not tightly-coupled
solutions, but things that you can just click,
click, click and just kind of get going.

So, you can RSVP to events like this or post
from your site and keep moving from there.
With this, these extensions can kind of encourage
people to start building their own sites.
The thing is, as kind of champions, we don't want to control how you do your stuff because
then we're in no better way than Facebook or Twitter.
They start to control how you interact with people.

What's going on? Okay.

So, this is the -- this slide's different.

That's fine.
This is the part where we have to understand --
and we have actually a good understanding
of the wiki documents things we notice people tend to get tripped on and where we go.

We have to understand where
we can encourage people to keep pulling things
and also, how can we kind of get out there

and say it's not as hard as it was five years ago.

It's got a lot better, it's a lot easier and there's ways we can get things done.

It's what we *can* do to pull people in. It's going to be hard.

It's not going to be easy.

Most good things that don't come easily.

They always come with a little strife, a little struggle.

That's where the third principle -- building for us
We have to build for us, but also the person
we're going to see in the room.

How can we ensure that whoever comes on after us
can easily get something that inspires them to invite other people.
We have lots of itches.

My wiki page, there's 14 specific things.
I'm trying to send posts to my site to write to my newsletter
so I can do it from one place vs 17.
We have to -- I'm going to avoid saying "we" or rather "have to"
We should encourage more people to take five
things off their list and hammer at it.

It creates a record of how we go about things.
How people can just think of something and
kind of make it happen.

And this is something I struggle with myself.

We have to hear what people are saying what
are the hardest things.

People will say anything.

But once we hear things that surface to the top, like
I can't see your posts.
I can't write to your site.

Kind of have to, like, hone on those ideas
and see where we can go from there.

That's where I close.
