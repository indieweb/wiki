== Notes ==
* [[PESOS]] vs [[POSSE]]
frustration with [[Instagram]] which downscales your images before it goes to your profile, and thus [[OwnYourGram]]

[[Bridgy]] and syndication / backfeed as essential

[[Twitter]] data export recently improved a lot! - https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1121610739133734912

Jeremy is talking about {{t}} being locked/banned on Twitter.
He could see what {{t}} had recently posted - what was the reason for being banned? A running post?

Remy is considering syndicating to Twitter, and then deleting it after a certain period of time.

People are doing that.

Rose knows someone with a 7 day example.

Use-case for deleting tweets after a certain time:
* there are trolls harrassing (especially women) for very old posts, trying to get them fired (e.g. Christina Warren - @film_girl)
* news sites embedding your tweets without permission
   
Right to delete yourself online vs right to forgotten

{{adactio}}: posting to twitter from you own site, is a healthier relationship, you are more in control

You can fix spelling mistakes on your site, even after you've POSSEd to Twitter.

Twitter has no archive navigation, or filter

[[Facebook]] coping strategies
* Rose setup a page and uses Jetpack in WordPress to POSSE to it.
* Jeremy used to have a simple [[IFTTT]] to cross-post to FB, considering setting up a new page

[[Medium]] coping strategies, *if* you have an existing following:
* caveat: no [[backfeed]] from Medium

If you don't, why bother?

If you don't already have a following on Medium, do you want to encourage people to follow you there?

"You should stop feeding those machines."

Problem of [[Mastodon]] users still posting separately on Twitter, Facebook etc.

You want to not miss out on conversations

Your website can be you, all of you. You can syndicate as fine-grained as you want. Send only some subset of stuff.

Jeremy has his primary @adactio that he's had since 2006 which is now all original posts (except for replies).
Now has separate twitter accounts for @adactioLinks etc for those parts of his site
