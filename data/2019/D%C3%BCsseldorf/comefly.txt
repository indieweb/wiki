== Notes ==

* {{rose}}: I currently use Tripit which lets me collect trip information. I would like a way to share that data with people without them having to have a tripit account to view it. https://www.tripit.com/developer
* Trips on {{aaronpk}}’s site are collections of other posts: he creates an event (already exists) and adds other posts he had already made (like flight posts) to it as a collection.
* aaronpk: is considering some sort of summary map view of all the posts in a trip collection
* Would not want everything between two points in time to turn up in the same collection automatically because a blog post written/published may not be about the trip.
* '''Dopplr'''
** after a trip, Dopplr would look at your Flickr and match timestamps of photos with a place from your Dopplr plans
* '''Nested events?'''
** one encompassing "Europe" trip that has multiple trip posts inside that post
** IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf, btconf, etc
** then each of those could be event/trips too with further nested posts
* Trips are like archive views, except the date range is arbitrary instead of based on the calendar dates
* '''Monthly summary views'''
** https://seblog.nl/2019/04
** https://aaronparecki.com/2019/04
** things to show: calendar with icons, "popular" posts, map with pins for posts/checkins
