== Notes ==
* {{aaronpk}} has been tracking GPS from his phone for 11 years.
* Locations are part of his posts. Venues, cities, etc are listed.
* Bike rides get their own posts with maps.
* Wants to be able to show a live map of where he is that he could share, e.g. when he is running late to somewhere.
** Had an app where he could share such a map, e.g. for “20 minutes”.
** There are still apps for things like this, e.g. [[Glympse]].
* Showing [[Compass]]. The phone app sends there.
** Some poeple in the room have their own set-up, but are uninterested in managing and having other peopls live GPS data.
* How much of this should be on your website?
* {{aaronpk}} would want to make a “normal” post on his site, where the post looks like it has a map, except the map is live updating (iframe to Compass?).
** Easiest way to do because the website needs to do as little work itself as possible.
** Should these posts be ephemeral? 
* Find my friends model: permanent access? Also allows sharing location for a set amount of time.
** Apps like these may also allow other people to initiate the location viewing, while the own website model would always need the website owner/data owner to initiate it.
* {{rose}} would like to be able to embed a map of her live location for a set amount of time.
** New location share (new time span) should always have a new URL again, do not make old embeds work again.
* Dirkdoering.de uses [[Strava]] and would like to bring the data to himself, and also to let e.g. his wife check his current location.
* If you support Micropub, Compass can already post tracks to your website.
* Should this also be build on top of private posts? May not always want to share with everyone?
* {{aaronpk}} showing post about how to setup your own live streaming.
** When you starting streaming video, it would Micropub to your website with a post that contained an iframe.
** Afterwards it would do a Micropub update removing the iframe and replacing it with the video file.
* flak.is How much of this topic is Quantified Self, and how much would be to help other people?
** For {{aaronpk}} it is 95% for himself (qs).
* Seems like Micropub create, then update, then delete, mode would be a good place to start.
* Would people want to share Compass views directly? Or would they always want it to go on their site?
** Compass being able to do everything by itself will make for an easier point of entry.
*** Problem with that may be login, which is IndieAuth only.
* [[Overland]] is used to push to Compass.
** shuttle.xoxofest.com was getting live GPS streaming from phones running Overland to show people where the shuttlebusses were.
* https://david.shanske.com/2019/03/31/setting-up-compass-with-gps-logger-for-android/
OwnTracks for Android was not being developed, however, it has a new developer and is back.
* Should Compass be able to tell Overland when it needs to do quicker updates for live watching?
