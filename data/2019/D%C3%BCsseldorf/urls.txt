Session: URLs How?
When: 2019-05-11 11:30

Structuring URLs, future proof, aggregation, 

== Participants ==
* Sonniesedge.net
* Webgefrickel.de
* Seblog.nl
* Rosemaryorchard.com
* {{adactio}}
* {{t}}
* DanielPietzsch.com
* {{martijnvdven}} – remote
* {{jgmac1106}} remote
* ... add names

== Background ==
https://indieweb.org/URL_design

== Notes ==
* Charlie shows her current URL design:
** /notes
** /notes/123
** /posts
** /posts/some-pretty-url
** Should /note/123 go to /notes/123? What should load on /bookmarks/123 when 123 is only an ID for a note?
* Has different content types for different concepts.
* wants a page to show different things together in one place. How do you call that?
* ... add notes

=== Examples ===
GitHub's blog post URLs are human readable, but not memorable, e.g.
* (Charlie showed one that she had bookmarked)

=== Hackability ===
* /things
* /things/ID
* /things/ID/otherthings
* /things/ID/otherthings/ID

E.g.
* Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tollwerk/45698290631/in/album-72157703142292825/
** shows whos photos, photo ID, but also in which album the view is

=== more notes ===
* feels like there is a difference between elements in a path and things in the query string
** things in the path feel like you have to keep available always
** things in the query string could be temporal / ephemeral

<!-- ** {{martijnvdven}}: path are directories, does it feel good to order resources in folders? Maybe order by path! (I don’t know how to best communicate with the room :P) Hi Seb! -->

uppercase vs lowercase
* {{martijnvdven}}’s URL is case-sensitive, because it uses a path.
* Charlie’s URLs are case-insensitive. /Bookmarks will rewrite to /bookmarks.

=== URLs as part of the UI ===
* How much control does a CMS give you over the URLs?
* We are all designers of the experience, we should be designing URLs.

=== How people use URLs ===
* People put URLs in the Google Search field, and expect the first hit to be the thing they want to visit.
* So do people actually “hack” URLs? Do they understand them?
* Do people even see URLs? Mobile browsers will only show the domain, some browsers (Safari) have started doing this on the desktop.
* Omnibar may have made a difference here too: previously browsers had separate fields for URLs and search. Writing a search term in the URL bar would not have worked, automatically informing people more about URLs.

=== Migrating URLs ===
* Charlie kept all the URLs when going from Craft CMS to Drupal
* If IDs are in the URL, and the IDs can stay the same, it is often easy to change non-ID parts of the URL (e.g. categories) and still have the CMS redirect automatically.
* On {{seblog}} the slug is not part of the unique URL for a post, so the slug can changed or removed.
** His URLs are also hackable, drop parts from the end and you go back to posts that day, month, year.
** Posts are stored as YEAR/ORDINAL/ID.
** 5eb.nl/4zt2 – number of days since epoch, encoded in newbase60: 4zt, and the ID of the post that day: 2.
