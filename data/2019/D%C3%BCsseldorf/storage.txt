Session: Storage is Hard (and Backups too)
When: 2019-05-11 15:00

== Notes ==
* we are arguing about text files vs databases.
* text files more searchable, exportable. Databases can do more complex data manipulation.
* why not databases / SQLite?
** story of WebSQL deprecation
** inspectability, scriptability of file system vs Sqlite file being versioned

* hybrid approach
** files as single source of truth
** database generated for index, searchability, can be deleted, and rebuilt

* evolution
** people start as flat files for ease of backup, simplicity of maintenance, longevity
** maybe they have a use-case for searching (e.g. how many times checked into Düsseldorf?) and write code
** eventually maybe add a database for caching / performance

* file structures
** one per post (many people), variants: folder per post (sebsel, webstefrickel), file per post plus folder (aaronpk)
** many posts per file - only {{t}} is doing in [[Falcon]] - for performance reasons, minimize file I/O for home page viewing, and permalink viewing. future: XHR for offline caching of posts
