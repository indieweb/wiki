'''<dfn>IndieWebCamp Düsseldorf 2019</dfn>''', the '''fifth IndieWebCamp in Düsseldorf''', will be 11-12 May 2019, right before the [https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2019 beyond tellerrand conference in Düsseldorf].

<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness every year. But there is still a lot of work to do to help people to understand what the IndieWeb is and “owning your data” actually means at all. To achieve this, to grow it and to help people getting started, we're meeting for a BarCamp style collaboration in Düsseldorf for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, collaborating, teaching, helping and much more.
