'''<dfn>[http://peach.cool Peach]</dfn>''' is a social network app that allows you to share [[notes]], [[photos]], [[gif]]s, [[chat]] with friends, and several other things by way of magic words [http://peach.cool/support]. It is only available via the iOS and Android apps, without a web interface, but people have reverse-engineered API access.[https://gist.github.com/ummjackson/4db1da44c509576c1d1b]
