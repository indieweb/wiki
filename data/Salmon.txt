{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://www.salmon-protocol.org/ Salmon]</dfn>''' is a 2010-era [[feed]]-based protocol part of the [[OStatus]] stack for sending [[comment]] notifications and has been superseded by the use of [[webmention]], [[h-entry]], and [[in-reply-to]] building blocks.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no known examples of indieweb sites supporting or using the Salmon Protocol.

Instead, indieweb sites are using the much simpler [[webmention]] protocol to send notifications about [[comments]] to the item that is being replied-to.

== Past Examples ==
=== Statusnet ===
In the past, [[StatusNet]] supported Salmon at least somewhat, as it was part of the OStatus stack supported by StatusNet.

== Criticism ==
=== Too Difficult To Implement ===
* {{t}} personally I tried to read and understand all the pieces necessary for Salmon back in 2010 and it seemed like far too much work so I refocused on implementing smaller, more incremental building blocks that gave me immediate results on my own site.
* {{barnabywalters}} tried to implement salmon to integrate with StatusNet in 2012 but eventually gave up due to complexity and lack of community support: <blockquote>Now I have my improved indieweb site on my identity domain, I want to have a crack at getting salmon working. First for mentions/replies, then for private messaging. I *could* test the entire process on my own, but it'll be much more fun to actually exchange messages with another site. I can test with StatusNet for webfinger-enabled discovery, any volunteers to help test HTML based discovery?</blockquote> http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2012-09-27/line/1348769830000<blockquote>I tried to implement salmon integration with statusnet but never got it working, with zero help forthcoming from the statusnet/ostatus community or codebase</blockquote>http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-26/line/1409060063416
