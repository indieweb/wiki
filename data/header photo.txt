'''A <dfn>header photo</dfn>''' is a landscape image often shown at the top of a profile, stream or article.

== Indieweb Examples ==

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby]]’s homepage stream has a panoramic header photo at the top, with vertical gradients on each side to fill the space in case the site is viewed on huge screens.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook.com ===
Facebook.com displays cover photos at the top of profiles, events and “pages”, e.g:

The header photo is referred to as “Cover” for pages, “Cover Photo” on personal profiles and “Event photo” for events.

=== Twitter.com ===
Twitter.com displays header photos at the top of profile pages, and as a smaller version as part of the profile of the currently logged in user on Twitter.com

In the profile-editing UI it’s referred to as the “header photo”.

== Attending.io ==
Attending.io displays a whole-screenful header photo at the top of event pages:

This design differs from the usual header photo design, as many important event details are overlaid onto the photo, including the RSVP call to action.
* I find this design to be very confusing. Apparently my brain has trained itself to skip over header photos and these whole-page emotional response images, so having my gaze forced back onto it in order to see basic details like the event location, time and name is somehow very awkward, and prevents me from being able to quickly get a feel for what the event, when it is or anything about it at all. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 12:53, 15 March 2016 (PDT)
