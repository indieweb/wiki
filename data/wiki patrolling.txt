'''Wiki patrolling''' is a form of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiGnome wikignoming] where a trusted user or admin checks pages that have been created by new or unverified users.

== On IWC wiki ==
Patrolling is useful on the IWC wiki primarily because the IRC channel allows unverified people to create pages via Loqi. Patrolling ensures that these pages meet the basic standards for inclusion on the wiki (not defaming people, not breaking the [[code of conduct]] etc.)

== What's this patrolling message on IRC? ==

'''Don't panic.'' Just wikignomes doing gnome things.
