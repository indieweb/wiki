Translated into [http://olsc.org/web_ouvert French] by [http://olsc.org/ Olivier Le Monnier] 

I'm using <code>lang="fr" hreflang="fr" rel="alternate"</code> on a hyperlink to the translation, with link text of translated post title, in a section with heading "Translations" in the footer of the original post. I also have a stylesheet that automatically inserts a little flag graphic based on the translated language (value of the <code>hreflang</code> attribute) immediately before the link to the translation. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 18:08, 28 January 2013 (PST) (The yellow backgrounds in the image are from my <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> styling and are not specific to the display of the translations.)

I'm using almost the same style as Tantek: <code>lang="fr" hreflang="fr" rel="alternate"</code> on a hyperlink to the translation, with link text of translated post title, in a section with heading "Translations" in the header of the original post on a yellow background. I also have a stylesheet that automatically inserts a little flag graphic based on the translated language (value of the <code>hreflang</code> attribute) immediately before the link to the translation. -[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] 12:45, 31 January 2013 (PST)

Right now I am simply including a link (annotated with rel=alternate and hreflang=fr) to the translation in a French-language paragraph inviting French readers to read in their native tongue, courtesy of Christophe. I should probably add some visual styling so it looks less like part of the actual article. Alternatively, a small flag on the header might be a good visual indicator that there are different translations available. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 09:12, 28 January 2013 (PST)

== Markup ==
On the link to the translated article, use <code>rel=[[rel-alternate|alternate]]</code> and <code>hreflang="lang-code"</code> attributes. If the link text is also in the translated language, use <code>lang="lang-code"</code> as well. The string "lang-code" is meant to be replaced by the ISO 639-1 language code for the translated language.

ISO 639-1 is surprisingly difficult to research due to the many standards in use. Useful resources include:

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes List of ISO 639-1 Codes] on wikipedia

== Open Questions ==
* What about hosting the translation back on your own site? Do we need to ask the translator’s permission?
** I would say we should ask the translators permission unless their content is CC licensed — either way a link back to them is good manners and improves the link network around a piece of content. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 09:16, 28 January 2013 (PST)
** I agree, need to ask permission to host a copy of the translation. Thus it makes sense to request that translators use a CC-by or CC0 license so we can avoid having to ask, and can simply incorporate according the license used. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 18:08, 28 January 2013 (PST)
