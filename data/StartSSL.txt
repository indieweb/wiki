'''<dfn>StartSSL</dfn>''' is a service that provides introductory SSL certificates for no cost, see [https://startssl.com startssl.com].

== Benefits ==
* Single-domain SSL certificates are free.
* You can create multiple certificates for individual subdomains, for example www.example.com and test.example.com
* You can pay $59 to go through the "personal identity validation" process, at which point you get to do the following for the next 360 days:
** Create as many wildcard certificates as you want for free (*.example.com), each is valid for 2 years
** Create multi-domain certificates (example.org, example.com)

== Issues ==
* The user interface is very awkward.
* Authentication is done '''only''' via browser client certificate, so make sure you back this up or you'll lose access to your account.
* While single SSL certificates are free, it costs $24.99 to revoke a certificate if you need to.
* You can only have one SSL certificate active per subdomain. There is a 2-week period where you can renew a certificate before it expires. This means if you lose your private key for a cert, you won't be able to re-create the cert with the same subdomain unless you pay to revoke the old one first.


== Criticism ==
* https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2016-02-16-why-i-stopped-using-startssl-because-of-qihoo-360.html "The PKI platform of StartSSL, an Israeli leader of free SSL certificates, is now hosted by Qihoo 360, a Chinese Antivirus Company." Qihoo 360 has a very bad reputation and so StartSSL may not be treated as trusted and secure anymore.

== FAQ ==

=== I lost my client certificate, or my client certificate expired ===
If you lost your client certificate, or if you forgot to create a new one before it expired, you can still recover you account. Create a new account with the same email address, and then email certmaster at startssl.com with the subject line "merge accounts", provide your email address, and ask that your accounts be merged.
