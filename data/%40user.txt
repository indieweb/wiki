{{stub}}

'''<dfn>@user</dfn>''' is a well-established internet convention for referring to someone using their online identity in a particular context, first used purely as static punctuation like in Flickr comments (and likely before), then first implemented in [[Twitter]] posts as a hyperlink to the user’s profile page, adopted by [[social media]] silos, notably [[Instagram]], and adopted by users in print, street art, and other media like TV broadcasts as a universal way to find and follow them, for a while on Twitter and more recently on Instagram.

On some sites (e.g. [[Medium]]) and in some software (e.g. [[Mastodon]]), <samp>@user</samp> is literally used at a top-level path on the site’s domain as either the canonical URL for a user, or redirects there (e.g. [[Twitter]]).

Some sites redirect a <samp>/@user</samp> to the user profile at simply <samp>/user</samp>

== Silo Support ==
There are numerous silos that have explicit support for linking <kbd>@user</kbd> in a plain text post to the profile of that user on their system, and/or support <samp>/@user</samp> paths.
* [[Twitter]] - hyperlinks @user, redirects <kbd>/@user</kbd> to <samp>/user</samp>
* [[Instagram]] - hyperlinks @user
* [[GitHub]] - hyperlinks @user
* [[Medium]] — may redirect <kbd>/@user</kbd> to <kbd>user.medium.com</kbd>, e.g. https://medium.com/@benwerd
