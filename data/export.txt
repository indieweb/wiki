Many [[silos]] offer the ability to download a copy of some of/all of your data. If this is of a high enough quality, it can be used as the basis of an indieweb site, or be imported into an existing indieweb site.

* [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] imported all his old [[Twitter]] content and (?) some of his [[Tumblr]] content into tommorris.org
* [[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] imported all his old [[Diaspora]] content into waterpigs.co.uk/notes

* [http://freedom.io freedom.io] transfers your siloed posts to a blog or cloud storage provider with structure and formatting intact, including comments, pictures, tags/mentions, links, etc. It's ''very'' immature and incomplete, especially the UI, which is horrible, but the functionality largely works. It migrates from [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]], and [[Instagram]] to [[Dropbox]], [[Tumblr]], [[Blogger]], or [[WordPress]] (self hosted and .com).
