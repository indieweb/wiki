'''General discussion (draft)'''

Unless your goal is to astonish users, you might want to consider limiting how astonishing your experience is on your website.

This may include considerations of different things for your website:
* Common patterns and landmarks
* Best or Good Practices

You might consider making features on your website a mixture of obvious (give context to what is contained in a link for example, by enclosing descriptive text in a anchor tag) or if they are not obvious that they do predictable things, like open other links on your own website for some footer links unless accompanied with an External Site icon or something else.
