{{stub}}

    A '''<dfn>pseudonym</dfn>''' is literally a "false name" and is one way in which people may choose not to reveal their true identity on the internet and IRL; IndieWeb principles do not require the use of real name or true identity at any point, and [[authentication]] and authorization are as easily accomplished with a pseudonym as with a real name. 

A person may use a single pseudonym, which effectively becomes their identity, or they may use several pseudonyms for different reasons and possibly different topics.
