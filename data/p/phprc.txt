'''<dfn>phprc</dfn>''' is what Dreamhost calls what's normally a [[php.ini]] config file - see https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview.

* TIL: If you want to use the 'tidy' extension (like to clean-up malformed HTML before parsing it for [[microformats]] for typical IndieWeb use-cases),  in your PHP code that runs on [[DreamHost]], you have to add it to your phprc which is inside a nested series of PHP and version number folders in your home directory, e.g. /home/tantek/.php/7.2/phprc - {{t}}
* ^ make sure there is a line with "extension = tidy.so" (by itself, without the quotes) in your phprc file.
