'''<dfn>phprc</dfn>''' is what [[Dreamhost]] calls their [[php.ini]] config file, and an essential part of running an [[H2VX]] service on a site hosted by Dreamhost.

== tidy ==
If you want to use the '<code>[[tidy]]</code>' extension (like to clean-up malformed [[HTML]] before parsing it for [[microformats]] for typical IndieWeb use-cases) in your PHP code that runs on [[DreamHost]], you have to add <kbd>extension = tidy.so</kbd> explicitly to your <kbd>phprc</kbd> file which is inside a nested series of <samp>PHP</samp> and version number folders in your home directory, e.g. <samp>~/.php/8.1/phprc</samp>

Make sure there is a line like this by itself in your <samp>phprc</samp> file (e.g. at the start)
<blockquote><kbd>extension = tidy.so</kbd></blockquote>
