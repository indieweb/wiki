* TIL: If you want to use the 'tidy' extension (like to clean-up malformed HTML before parsing it for [[microformats]] for typical IndieWeb use-cases),  in your PHP code that runs on [[DreamHost]], you have to add it to your phprc which is inside a nested series of PHP and version number folders in your home directory, e.g. /home/tantek/.php/7.2/phprc - {{t}}
