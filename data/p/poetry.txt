'''<dfn>Poetry</dfn>''' is a writing form that can be found on many personal websites. In addition to traditional written form, one can add additional formatting or multimedia elements ([[photo]]s, [[audio]], [[video]], [[CSS]], etc.) to supplement their meaning.

<blockquote>IndieWeb could be a great place for poets to publish in a way that they are in control.&mdash;{{JackyAlcine}} at [[2018/changetheratio|IndieWebSummit 2018]]</blockquote>

== How to ==
Most poets put their poetry on their sites in basic text with some HTML and CSS. There are currently no custom [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post types]] or markup for posting poetry, so some may designate it as an [[article]] or a simple [[note]]. Examples and brainstorming are welcome below.
