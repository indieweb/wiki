'''<dfn>Poetry</dfn>''' is a writing form that can be found on many personal websites. In addition to traditional written form, one can add additional formatting or multimedia elements ([[photo]]s, [[audio]], [[video]], [[CSS]], etc.) to supplement their meaning.

<blockquote>IndieWeb could be a great place for poets to publish in a way that they are in control.&mdash;{{JackyAlcine}} at [[2018/changetheratio|IndieWebSummit 2018]]</blockquote>

== How to ==
Most poets put their poetry on their sites in basic text with some HTML and CSS. There are currently no custom [[posts#Types_of_Posts|post types]] or markup for posting poetry, so some may designate it as an [[article]] or a simple [[note]]. Examples and brainstorming are welcome below.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
__TOC__

=== Greg McVerry ===
* {{jgmac1106}} used IndieWeb Camps to build a poetry [https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2020/02/09/my-day-two-2020-indiewebcamp-online-goal-build-a-poetry Building a Poetry Page] which was finished and demoed at a later camp [https://jgregorymcverry.com/mypoetry Poetry Page]

==== 100 Poems in 100 Days ====
*2020: {{jgmac1106}} did a poetry microcast of one poem every day. [https://jgregorymcverry/mypoetry#audiopoems PoemBox a Boombox of Bad Poems] Hundredth poem published on [https://jgregorymcverry.com/mypoetry#20200708 2020-07-08]

==== 30 Days of Webmention poetry ====
* 30 Days of collaborative [[webmention]] poetry. {{jgmac1106}} and [https://dogtrax.edublogs.com Dogtrax] wrote a collaborative poem using webmention. Each day one of the pairs, usually both, would add to the poem by writing a new poem. [https://jgregorymcverry.com/untitledpoem untitled poem].

=== The Daily Connector ===
* [https://dailyconnector.com/about/ The Daily Connector] experimented with IndieWeb poetry and syndicating to IndieWeb.xyz: https://dailyconnector.com/2018/10/10/testing-out-indieweb-with-poetry/

=== Maxwell Joslyn ===
* {{maxwelljoslyn}} has a [https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/poems/index poems index] which he plans to convert into a collection by giving each poem its own permalink
* poems are ordered non-chronologically; if he turns his poetry page into a feed, he would like that order to be respected in indie [[readers]]
* Following discussion at [[2020/Online/collections]] he converted his poems page into a [[collection]]. Upgrades to his site's build script, JS, HTML, and CSS were involved. Explanatory blog post [https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/notes/2020/02/09/1 here].


== Other Examples ==
* {{kevinmarks}} describes how to use Google browser and search functionality to highlight found text in web pages to create a form of erasure/blackout poetry on the web at https://highlightpoetry.com/. One can place links on their own web pages that point to other's pages with the highlights shown. In an ideal IndieWeb world, one may wish to archive such pages or do screengrabs of the content to ensure disappearance of the page doesn't result in linkrot or actual erasure of one's erasure poem.

* ''[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/the-ferguson-report-an-erasure-nicole-sealey-poem The Ferguson Report: An Erasure]'' by Nicole Sealey in the ''New Yorker'' on 2023-07-24 [https://web.archive.org/web/20230817010722/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/the-ferguson-report-an-erasure-nicole-sealey-poem archive copy]
** Provides an interesting UI example of a blackout poem in which the white text on a black background appears solid upon first view, but as one scrolls down the primary text dims to greay and the revealed poem remains bright white. (Compare with Kevin Marks example of highlight poetry.)

== Discovery ==
{{main|discovery}}
Like most writing online, most authors want their work to be read. Toward improving the idea of [[discovery]], the following are some IndieWeb ways for having one's poetry found:

=== IndieWeb.xyz ===
* [[Indieweb.xyz]] has several stubs that one can [[Webmention]] to aggregate and share their poetry with others via [[syndication]].
** https://indieweb.xyz/en/poetry
** https://indieweb.xyz/en/indiewebpoetry

=== CLMOOC ===
* [https://clmoocring.jgregorymcverry.com/clmooc-planet/ CLMOOC]
** built by {{jgmac1106}} using the [[Inoreader]] [[RSS]] reader and then creating an iframe on a [[WordPress]] site
** used to collect poetry, art, [[music]] and musings such [https://write.as/dogtrax/a-found-feldgang-poem-from-the-musings-of-friends A Found Feldgang Poem]
** Includes a [[web ring]] using a WordPress plugin.

=== Poetry Friday ===
* [http://kidlitosphere.org/poetry-friday/ Poetry Friday]: At the end of the week many children’s book aficionados and bloggers use their sites to contribute favorite poems or chat about something poetical in an event called Poetry Friday. The features can be for children or adults, can be original poems, reviews of poetry books, reviews of poetic picture books, links to poems at copyright protected sites, thoughts about poetry, and more. Song lyrics have been even been featured.
