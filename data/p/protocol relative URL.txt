A '''<dfn>protocol relative URL</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>PRURL</dfn>) is a URL on a page (hyperlink, image source or similar) that starts with "//" and re-uses the protocol of the page itself, typically re-using http: or https: from how the page was loaded, which used to be a common web development practice and is now generally discouraged for various [[performance]] and [[security]] reasons.

== Why not ==

== How to ==
=== How to link same site images ===
For images (and other media files on your site), rather than a protocol relative URL, use a domain relative or current page relative URL.

If the images are literally part of the page and you expect them to move together (e.g. if you change your [[URL design]]), then use a current page relative URL.

If the images are in a separate global directory on your site, like <code>/images/example.jpg</code> then use a domain relative URL.

=== How to link subdomain images ===
If your images (or other media files) are served from a [[subdomain]], like <code>images.</code> in order to use a different hosting service like [[AWS]] for large static files, you should use absolute <code>https://</code> URLs rather than protocol relative because any modern static file hosting service already supports https, and you especially want [[HTTPS]] performance and security advantages for (potentially multiple) large files being retrieved from another site.
