'''<dfn>photo brainstorming</dfn>''' is a page where indieweb users who are working out how to publish [[photos]] on their own site can document design challenges, issues, brainstorm ideas and show examples of photography on the web that inspires them.

== People Area Tagging ==
See: [[area-tag#person_tag_as_area_tag|person tag as area tag]]

== POSSE ==
=== Why POSSE rather than TwitterCard ===
(Not sure if this belongs here or on [[Twitter]] page, but capturing as part of this for now.)
Advantages to POSSEing actual photos to Twitter, rather than just a link to a photo post on your site with [[Twitter Cards]] metacrap markup:
* Further distribute the use of Twitter kind of like a CDN for your photos
* People see a larger version of the photo via a phototweet than a Twittercard
* Usual avoid [[metacrap]] (silo-specific meta tags) advantage
* Photo tweets appear inline in tweet list views (e.g. Twitter timeline / homepage) whereas twitter cards won't appear inline automatically (require twiddling open).
* Photo tweets work immediately, whereas photo cards require that Twitter whitelist your domain for cards in general (and maybe in particular for photo cards?)
* Using the TwitterAPI hides the proprietariness, whereas using twittercards means your own website has proprietary metacrap on it
* Twittercards set a worse example (proprietary metacrap) for others that may view source

== Clustering ==
It may make sense to cluster sequential photo posts when displaying them in a stream, especially in a composite stream (e.g. on a homepage).

Both [[like#text_only_design|text only like display brainstorming]], and [[like#Instagram_followings_activity|Instagram’s followings activity]] show benefits of clustering.

Use-case:
* {{t}} use-case is I want sometimes I want to post a bunch (a ton?) of photos and not worry that it would be "filling up" my homepage or stream etc. related: [[publics#Tantek|publics - concerns about overposting]].
** {{aaronpk}} Ah yeah the "dump lots of photos" problem i can relate to

Concerns:
* {{aaronpk}}: "I often have unrelated photos in a sequence on my home page and I don't want them to cluster in a way that implies they are related"

Approaches:
* If the photos share a hashtag which is used in &lt;10% of photo posts, then cluster them.
** that way if they really were "unrelated" photos, they wouldn't get clustered

Workaround:
* {{aaronpk}} "if I wanted photos to be clustered I would make an album post instead"

== Motivations ==
=== [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] ===
Hosting my own photos has been something I've been wanting to do for a while. This is partly because I'm unhappy with most of the silos I've used:

* Instagram — fine for the odd snap, but I use it in private mode because there's no easy way of having privacy controls.
* Facebook — fine for putting up photos of friends, but... it's Facebook and they creep me out.
* [[Flickr]] — one word: [[Yahoo|Yahoo!]] It's been redesigned a couple of times now, not necessarily for the better.
* Wikimedia Commons — I'm reasonably confident Commons will stick around, but am unhappy with some of the administrative politics (and deeply distrust some of the administrators), and it has a limited [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Scope scope]—hosting only "freely-licensed educational media content". Commons is a great place to host some but not all content I wish to post. Commons is also very rigid about copyright: it attempts to adhere to copyright in both the United States and in the country where the photograph was taken. Some photos taken in France, Belgium, Italy and (with obscure exceptions) the Netherlands which do not have [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Freedom_of_panorama freedom of panorama] cannot be hosted on Commons even though the images are legal in my country of citizenship, the United Kingdom.

Ideally, I want to host my own photos and have some of them stored elsewhere. The ones I ''don't'' want to be public are probably best stored on Facebook.

==== Photography on the web I find inspiring ====
* [http://paulstamatiou.com/photos/ Paul Stamatiou's Photos] — good photography, enticing layout.
* [http://www.urban75.org/photos/ Urban75] — Urban75 is an old-school staple of British independent web publishing. The layout is very 90s but the photography is pretty good, and the information architecture makes me want to explore it more.

== How to take photos ==
Some tips here for how as an indie photographer you can instruct your subjects:

== Capturing selecting editing ==
The acts of capturing (taking) photos, then selecting which ones to post where, then editing them how and why, are essential to the overall task of publishing photos, yet most of the documentation we have is about once you have a photo that you want to post, how do you post it.

This brainstorming section is meant to capture everything between when you first think of taking a photo (and why), and when you have a photo ready to publish.

Capturing:
* {{t}} I take photos quite often, whenever I feel I see something "interesting" and can do so without badly interrupting the flow of whatever I happen to be doing. I also quite regularly take photos of food and drink I’m consuming, menus of restaurants I visit, and maps when visiting other cities. I usually take photos with HDR explicitly selected to "On" on my [[iPod Touch]].

Pruning:
* {{t}} I typically delete:
** '''non-HDR versions of photos''' (exceptions: sometimes with motion, the non-HDR version is higher quality, or has fewer artifacts and is preferred. Sometimes sunrise / sunset photos look better in the non-HDR version, especially with colors, brightness, and lens flare effects). 
** '''non-best photos of something''' - If I have a series of photos of the same thing at around the same time, with similar framing, I’ll likely delete all but the best / most representative photo of that "moment".
** '''photos making people look bad''' - photos that capture an unfortunate, awkward, or embarrassing facial expression or posture, either of others or myself.

Selecting:
* {{t}} I go through photos of an event or activity and favorite (heart) some of them in the iOS Photos app as a way of choosing which ones I may or likely do want to post publicly in a [[photo]] or [[multiphoto]] post.
** More broadly, I select photos that won't violate someone's privacy for online upload / archival. Because I archive on Swarm/Foursquare (not the most reliable), access is a limited set of friends-only, so I feel fairly confident with uploading most photos without fear. I may keep or delete other photos, typically only keeping those that have a personal/private significance.

Editing:
* {{t}} I edit in two rough phases:
*# I go through the photos I intend to upload/archive online and recent "favorited" (in iOS Photos app) photos, and do basic corrective edits of: 
*## rotating to align horizon and some minimal cropping to remove extraneous things on the edges. 
*## if a photo is close to a good alignment of horizon (e.g. 50% or on one of the thirds lines), I’ll likely rescale the photo and pan it to align the horizon accordingly.
*# For photos I intend to publish, I do a bit more thorough editing, specifically:
*## deciding on a possible alternative cropping (from the original landscape/portrait crop), e.g. square or 16:9, depending on the subject matter and how well the cropping frames the context and subject of the photo.
*## after cropping I may pan the image to align one more more subjects / points of interest in the image with either one of the thirds lines, or middle of the image (horizontally and/or vertically).

Uploading / archival:
* {{t}} since I don't yet have a Media upload Micropub endpoint, I use [[Swarm]] for limited friends-only uploading / archival of my photos
