== About ==

IndieWebCamp is a gathering of web [[creators]] building &amp; sharing open web technologies to advance the state of the indie web. We get together for a weekend to discuss how we can empower people to own their identities and data, then spend a day hacking &amp; creating.

The [[2011|first IndieWebCamp]] was held in Portland, Oregon, in 2011. Subsequently, IndieWebCamps have been held in Brighton (England), Cambridge, Düsseldorf (Germany), Edinburgh (England), Los Angeles, Nuremberg (Germany), New York City, Portland and San Francisco..
