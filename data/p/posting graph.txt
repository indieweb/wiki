=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} on boffosocko.com since late 2018 uses the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitysparks/ ActivitySparks plugin] for [[WordPress]] to display sparklines for "Daily activity over the prior 3 months" and "Monthly activity over 5 years" for both posting activity as well as commenting activity. On [[archive]] pages for [[categories]], these sparkline graphs are updated to show the activity for only that category.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Archive.org ===
The [[Internet Archive]] has a circular user interface to represent posts and pages on an archived website which is generally organized by path names. Hovering over colored portions of their circle chart provides particular links for that site on the archive. While somewhat different presentations compared to [[sparklines]] and [[calendar heatmap]]s, this presents a lot of the same type of information and links.
* Example http://web.archive.org/web/sitemap/https://www.boffosocko.com/
[[File:posting_activity_from_archive-org_2018.PNG|center|alt=User Interface that presents concentric circles with archived links of a website. The center circle is the domain itself while outside portions of the circle include archive pages, categories, pages, posts, and other portions of a site.]]
