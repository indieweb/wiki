{{chrisaldrich}} on boffosocko.com since late 2018 uses the [https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitysparks/ ActivitySparks plugin] for [[WordPress]] to display sparklines for "Daily activity over the prior 3 months" and "Monthly activity over 5 years" for both posting activity as well as commenting activity. On [[archive]] pages for [[categories]], these sparkline graphs are updated to show the activity for only that category.
