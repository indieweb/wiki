'''<dfn>person mention</dfn>''' is a [[homepage#Webmention_to_homepage|homepage webmention]] sent to a person's [[homepage]].

== Why ==
You should send person mentions whenever you post one of these so people can be notified that you've mentioned them!
* [[person-tag]]
* [[invitation]] to a person
* private [[message]] to a person

You should accept person mentions of/to your site so you can find out when others have mentioned you!

== How ==
=== How to person mention ===
Send a [[webmention]] as you usually would:
* source: your post permalink
* target: the person's [[homepage]] URL

If you're doing something beyond merely mentioning someone, e.g. inviting them to an event, or person-tagging them, then see these pages for how to add that markup:
* [[invitation]]
* [[person-tag]]

=== How to receive person mentions ===
You should separate out webmentions to your homepage into a separate list on your site, perhaps even sending you [[notifications]] for each using your preferred notification mechanism.

=== How to distinguish person mentions ===
When you receive a person mention, it may mean something more, here's how you tell.

* '''[[invitation]]''': if the target link to your home page is a <code>u-invitee</code> link, then you've been invited to the event linked to by the [[in-reply-to]] of that [[h-entry]]
* '''[[person-tag]]''': someone tagged you in their (source) post, if the target link to your home page is a <code>u-category</code> link.
** unless the containing [[h-entry]] has a <code>u-tag-of</code> link, in which case the source is merely tagging you in a different post, the post that the <code>u-tag-of</code> links to.
* ...
* otherwise it's just a mention.

Once you've distinguished different kinds of person mentions, you may want to:
* '''display these differently''' (in abovementioned list on your site), e.g. with different icons, prose, clustering, and/or sorting than "plain" person mentions
* '''send different [[notifications]]''' for (or maybe only send for some not for all) different kinds of person mentions
* '''provide different UI''' on each in a list, e.g.
** for [[person-tag]]s, perhaps provide the option to request "untagging" ("untag-of" link?)
** for [[invitation]]s, provide [[RSVP]] buttons yes, no, maybe, save which could one-click create respective RSVP posts on your site and send webmentions accordingly (back to the invitation, and to the event as well).
