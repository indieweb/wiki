{{stub}}

'''<dfn>person mention</dfn>''' is a [[homepage#Webmention_to_homepage|homepage webmention]] sent to a person's [[homepage]].

== Why ==
You should send person mentions whenever you post one of these so people can be notified that you've mentioned them!
* [[person-tag]]
* [[invitation]] to a person
* private [[message]] to a person

You should accept person mentions of/to your site so you can find out when others have mentioned you!

== How ==
=== How to person mention ===
Send a [[webmention]] as you usually would:
* source: your post permalink
* target: the person's [[homepage]] URL

If you're doing something beyond merely mentioning someone, e.g. inviting them to an event, or person-tagging them, then see these pages for how to add that markup:
* [[invitation]]
* [[person-tag]]

=== How to receive person mentions ===
You should separate out webmentions to your homepage into a separate list on your site, perhaps even sending you [[notifications]] for each using your preferred notification mechanism.

=== How to distinguish person mentions ===
When you receive a person mention, it may mean something more, here's how you tell.

* '''[[invitation]]''': if the target link to your home page is a <code>u-invitee</code> link, then you've been invited to the event linked to by the [[in-reply-to]] of that [[h-entry]]
* '''[[person-tag]]''': someone tagged you in their (source) post, if the target link to your home page is a <code>u-category</code> link.
** unless the containing [[h-entry]] has a <code>u-tag-of</code> link, in which case the source is merely tagging you in a different post, the post that the <code>u-tag-of</code> links to.
* ...
* otherwise it's just a mention.

Once you've distinguished different kinds of person mentions, you may want to:
* '''display these differently''' (in abovementioned list on your site), e.g. with different icons, prose, clustering, and/or sorting than "plain" person mentions
* '''send different [[notifications]]''' for (or maybe only send for some not for all) different kinds of person mentions
* '''provide different UI''' on each in a list, e.g.
** for [[person-tag]]s, perhaps provide the option to request "untagging" ("untag-of" link?)
** for [[invitation]]s, provide [[RSVP]] buttons yes, no, maybe, save which could one-click create respective RSVP posts on your site and send webmentions accordingly (back to the invitation, and to the event as well).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of IndieWeb sites that send and/or receive person mentions and do something visible (perhaps only to the site owner) with them.

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} started using @domain.tld syntax since at least [http://tantek.com/2017/345/t1/aaronpk-paid-thanks 2017-12-11] <blockquote>@aaronpk.com paid in full via Venmo! Thanks for the @BlueStarDonuts! üç©üç©üç©üç©</blockquote>
and added it to the [[CASSIS]] [[auto link]] function on [https://github.com/tantek/cassis/commit/0e8e6270c0a3b600423c283f59b5d22c3648d59a 2017-12-13]

Before that, {{t}} had experimented in 2011 with the <samp>+Name</samp> syntax from [[Google+]], in blog posts referring to people by full name and linking to their domain:

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Twitter]]

== Brainstorming ==
* to-do: describe how a "person mention" on the IndieWeb heavily overlaps with @-domain mentions (as noted in @domain description above), and is related to but different from an @-mention (or @mention) on a [[silo]] or an @-@ mention to a Mastodon or other fediverse account.
* to-do: describe How To use Bridgy Fed to @-@ person mention someone‚Äôs Mastodon profile
* Use 'https:' when auto-linking @-mentions or @-@-mentions per https://tantek.com/2023/011/t1/indieweb-evolving-at-mention and use-cases:
** @-@ (pronounced at-at)
** In a reply to a public post, clearly express that you‚Äôre speaking to that person
** In a reply to a reply, that you‚Äôre speaking to everyone upthread (AKA a https://indieweb.org/canoe)
** When attributing something to someone (photo/post/cool thing by so-and-so), giving credit
** Distinguish a person (or something that can be followed) from ‚Äújust‚Äù a site
** For all the above, notifying someone accordingly
** Some ideas:
*** 1. Ideally, if/when everyone has their own domain (where they receive Webmention notifications, and a feed you can follow), we can @-name their domain, which your auto-linker should hyperlink accordingly, e.g.<br>* @aaronparecki.com @anomalily.net @Martymcgui.re‚Äé @david.shanske.com @voxpelli.com @adactio.com @marcthiele.com @mxb.dev. These all look close enough to social media aliases/names that they‚Äôre immediately recognizable as readable @-names, a good consideration when choosing a domain name.
*** 2. As a fallback (e.g. for non-@-domain-auto-linking destinations) we can use someone‚Äôs plain domain (explicitly with https:), especially if their home page still has a stream or feed you can follow, or maybe if they don‚Äôt receive homepage Webmentions (yet), e.g.:<br>* https://jacky.wtf/ https://tmichellemoore.com/ https://crowdersoup.com/
*** 3. Some folks with personal sites have (for now) created separate Mastodon accounts (or installed an instance on a subdomain), and for them, we can reference their @-@ parenthetically after their domain, like:<br>* https://kevinmarks.com/ (@kevinmarks@xoxo.zone), https://dangillmor.com/ (@dangillmor@mastodon.social), https://simonwillison.net/ (@simon@simonwillison.net) 
** syntactic auto-linking of @-@ addresses like this:<br>* @user@example.com --> https://example.com/@user
** special case for @-domain@-domain to just link to the domain, e.g.:<br>* @tantek.com@tantek.com --> https://tantek.com/
** policy decision to auto-link all @-@ (and @-domain) mentions to https:, the reasoning being that identities on the web should be using https.
* https://tantek.com/2024/070/t1/updated-auto-linking-mention-use-cases
** @-domains with dashes/hyphens
** @-@ with (some) Unicode alphabetic characters
** @-domain-and-path for indicating @-mentions of silo profiles that don‚Äôt support @-@ syntax, like @flickr.com/people/tantek or @instagram.com/tantek
