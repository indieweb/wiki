'''<dfn>person mention</dfn>''' is a [[homepage#Webmention_to_homepage|homepage webmention]] sent to a person's [[homepage]].

== Why ==
You should send person mentions whenever you post one of these so people can be notified that you've mentioned them!
* [[person-tag]]
* [[invitation]] to a person
* private [[message]] to a person

You should accept person mentions of/to your site so you can find out when others have mentioned you!

== How ==
=== How to person mention ===
Send a [[webmention]] as you usually would:
* source: your post permalink
* target: the person's [[homepage]] URL

If you're doing something beyond merely mentioning someone, e.g. inviting them to an event, or person-tagging them, then see these pages for how to add that markup:
* [[invitation]]
* [[person-tag]]

=== How to receive person mentions ===
You should separate out webmentions to your homepage into a separate list on your site, perhaps even sending you [[notifications]] for each using your preferred notification mechanism.

=== How to distinguish person mentions ===
When you receive a person mention, it may mean something more, here's how you tell.

* '''[[invitation]]''': if the target link to your home page is a <code>u-invitee</code> link, then you've been invited to the event linked to by the [[in-reply-to]] of that [[h-entry]]
* '''[[person-tag]]''': someone tagged you in their (source) post, if the target link to your home page is a <code>u-category</code> link.
** unless the containing [[h-entry]] has a <code>u-tag-of</code> link, in which case the source is merely tagging you in a different post, the post that the <code>u-tag-of</code> links to.
* ...
* otherwise it's just a mention.

Once you've distinguished different kinds of person mentions, you may want to:
* '''display these differently''' (in abovementioned list on your site), e.g. with different icons, prose, clustering, and/or sorting than "plain" person mentions
* '''send different [[notifications]]''' for (or maybe only send for some not for all) different kinds of person mentions
* '''provide different UI''' on each in a list, e.g.
** for [[person-tag]]s, perhaps provide the option to request "untagging" ("untag-of" link?)
** for [[invitation]]s, provide [[RSVP]] buttons yes, no, maybe, save which could one-click create respective RSVP posts on your site and send webmentions accordingly (back to the invitation, and to the event as well).

* {{ben_thatmustbeme}} displays all webmentions to his homepage url under "Recent Mentions" on the sidebar since YYYY-MM-DD(?)

{{t}} started using @domain.tld syntax since at least [http://tantek.com/2017/345/t1/aaronpk-paid-thanks 2017-12-11] <blockquote>@aaronpk.com paid in full via Venmo! Thanks for the @BlueStarDonuts! üç©üç©üç©üç©</blockquote>
and added it to the [[CASSIS]] [[auto link]] function on [https://github.com/tantek/cassis/commit/0e8e6270c0a3b600423c283f59b5d22c3648d59a 2017-12-13]

Before that, {{t}} had experimented in 2011 with the <samp>+Name</samp> syntax from [[Google+]], in blog posts referring to people by full name and linking to their domain:

* to-do: describe how a "person mention" on the IndieWeb heavily overlaps with @-domain mentions (as noted in @domain description above), and is related to but different from an @-mention (or @mention) on a [[silo]] or an @-@ mention to a Mastodon or other fediverse account.

** "One of the fun things about #IndieWeb notes & replies is that how we post is actively evolving! Like how should we @ someone?<br><br>#socialMedia aliases (e.g. @Twitter) were obvious, with prior @-name usage on Flickr etc.<br><br>Now, some have a domain, or an @-@ (pronounced at-at, yes, just like the abbreviation for Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport¬π), or some have both.<br><br>We can ask questions like why do we @-someone? What are the use-cases?<br>* In a reply to a public post, clearly express that you‚Äôre speaking to that person<br>* In a reply to a reply, that you‚Äôre speaking to everyone upthread (AKA a https://indieweb.org/canoe)<br>* When attributing something to someone (photo/post/cool thing by so-and-so), giving credit<br>* Distinguish a person (or something that can be followed) from ‚Äújust‚Äù a site<br>* For all the above, notifying someone accordingly<br><br>Some ideas:<br><br>1. Ideally, if/when everyone has their own domain (where they receive Webmention notifications, and a feed you can follow), we can @-name their domain, which your auto-linker¬≤ should hyperlink accordingly, e.g.<br>* @aaronparecki.com @anomalily.net @Martymcgui.re‚Äé @david.shanske.com @voxpelli.com @adactio.com @marcthiele.com @mxb.dev<br><br>These all look close enough to social media aliases/names that they‚Äôre immediately recognizable as readable @-names, a good consideration when choosing a domain name.¬≥<br><br>2. As a fallback (e.g. for non-@-domain-auto-linking destinations) we can use someone‚Äôs plain domain (explicitly with https:), especially if their home page still has a stream or feed you can follow, or maybe if they don‚Äôt receive homepage Webmentions (yet), e.g.:<br>* https://jacky.wtf/ https://tmichellemoore.com/ https://crowdersoup.com/<br><br>3. Some folks with personal sites have (for now) created separate Mastodon accounts (or installed an instance on a subdomain), and for them, we can reference their @-@ parenthetically after their domain, like:<br>* https://kevinmarks.com/ (@kevinmarks@xoxo.zone), https://dangillmor.com/ (@dangillmor@mastodon.social), https://simonwillison.net/ (@simon@simonwillison.net) <br><br>Rather than using social media silo @-names (except when explicitly replying to a silo), I‚Äôm now experimenting with all three of these (1-3) instead, both to elevate people‚Äôs IndieWeb identities, and for Mastodon viewers, provide a convenient way to follow @-@ addresses.<br><br>If someone‚Äôs homepage receives Webmentions, they will get notified when I @-mention them by domain.<br><br>I recently implemented syntactic auto-linking of @-@ addresses like this:<br>* @user@example.com --> https://example.com/@user<br>with a special case for @-domain@-domain to just link to the domain, e.g.:<br>* @tantek.com@tantek.com --> https://tantek.com/<br><br>I also made a recent policy decision to auto-link all @-@ (and @-domain) mentions to https:, the reasoning being that identities on the web should be using https.<br>* Testing in production here: https://tantek.com/cassis.js, search for "auto_link("<br><br>Some questions: <br>* Does/do Mastodon (or other ActivityPub servers) notify people when you @-@ mention them in a post? How? Who‚Äôs responsible for that?<br>* Will Bridgy Fed notify the servers (deliver to AP inboxes) of folks I merely @-@ mention (rather than explicit replies, reposts)? Should it?<br><br>So many people are switching to using their personal domains to post (or at least a Mastodon account) that I no longer feel compelled to @-mention people‚Äôs Twitter handles in posts, which feels refreshing. <br><br>Now the fun part is experimenting and figuring out what combination of @-domain, plain domain, or @-@ mentions looks good, makes sense to people, and sends notifications to people the way they want to receive them.<br><br>This is day 11 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.<br><br>‚Üê Day 10: https://tantek.com/2023/010/t2/build-use-services<br>‚Üí Day 12: https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c<br><br>¬π https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-AT<br>¬≤ My https://tantek.com/github/cassis/blob/master/cassis.js auto_link() function supports @example.com auto-linking, yours should too.<br>¬≥ https://tantek.com/2023/004/t1/choosing-domain-name-indieweb" [https://tantek.com/ @Tantek √áelik] January 11, 2023
