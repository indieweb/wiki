{{stub}}
'''<dfn>pixel art</dfn>''' are images that are intentionally low-resolution, sometimes used as icons on indieweb sites. These pixel art images should be scaled up using nearest neighbor scaling.

== Rendering Pixel Art ==
Use the <code>image-rendering: pixelated</code> CSS property so that pixel art scales as intended.

<pre>
.u-pixel-art {
    image-rendering: pixelated;  /* Chrome */

    /* Firefox */
    image-rendering: crisp-edges;
    image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges;

    image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;  /* Safari */
}
</pre>

See [https://lospec.com/browser-image-scaling-comparison lospec's guide] on all the pixel art scaling options.
