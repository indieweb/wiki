'''<dfn>Photo upload</dfn>''' is the act of sending a [[photo]] or other image file from a local device like a mobile phone of laptop to some place on the internet like a web server or service where it can be used to create a [[photo]] post or add a photo to another kind of [[post]].

Uploading is one step of many for creating a [[photo]] post, in roughly this order but sometimes with steps combined or re-ordered:
* [[photo capture]] - the act of taking a photo on a camera or mobile phone
* [[photo editing]] - editing a photo, often on a local device, often before uploading
* [[photo upload]]
* [[photo storage]] - where you store photos that are uploaded, perhaps longterm, and backups
* [[photo hosting]] - where you serve photos displayed in [[posts]]

For UIs to [[create]] a photo post, see:
* [[create#Photo]]

== Passive Uploads ==
Ideally, whatever device you take photos can passively upload them (when on a free / fast connection) to your preferred [[photo storage]] destination.

There are a number of ways to set this up, depending on the destination.

IndieWeb:
* {{aaronpk}} made an iOS camera app that auto-uploads any photos taken to his [[Micropub]] endpoint. Photos can also be selected from the camera roll. https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2025-10-30#t1761793727609500
** status: private, unreleased

Silos:
* [[Flickr]]’s iOS app has an '''Auto-Uploadr''' [sic] feature that: <blockquote>… is an easy way to privately store your photos and videos — until you choose to share them.</blockquote> and works in the background. It allows you to opt in or out of "uploading over cellular [mobile]" connections.
** Limitations
*** Does not re-upload locally edited photos
*** Does not delete photos that are deleted locally (by design, so you can use your auto-uploaded photos as a backup in case you accidentally delete a photo locally)

== HTML5 photo uploads ==
HTML5 extends the input element to permit pages to declaratively attempt photo uploads with:
* <code>&lt;input type="file" accept="image/*"&gt;</code>
For documentation on how this works in browsers see:
* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/Input#Image_capture_from_cameras documentation of camera capture on developer.mozilla.org]

== Mobile upload ==
Until in-browser approaches mature, it may be necessary to use native apps (either tied to a service and then [[PESOS]], or a wrapper app around personal blogging web apps to provide camera functionality).

=== Other approaches ===
* Email as possible approach? Most smart phones have an email client, and/or have "email this photo" support built-into their native/default camera applications. If you could set-up a custom email address (security through obscurity) on your own domain for receiving photo uploads, you could use that to "upload" photos, and then have your indieweb site POSSE out to the above-mentioned silos.

* [[OwnCloud]] has an Android client which can upload new photos taken on the camera to your own installation,

* Android [http://botsync.com/ BotSync] will watch a subdirectory on your phone and use the <code>scp</code> protocol to transfer new files in that directory to a server, but appears to have some issues with larger files (ie: video).

* The Android app "FolderSync" appears to be a more full-featured alternative to BotSync.

* At the [[2016/Dusseldorf/photos|IWC Düsseldorf photo session]] multiple people reported that the Dropbox App works most reliably for photo transfer from mobile

* With such sync approaches it makes sense for the UI to offer the user the option to pick an image from the recently uploaded ones

* HTTP uploads (and by extension everything based on them, e.g. [[Micropub]], normal HTML upload forms) by default do not support uploading files bit-by-bit or resuming interrupted uploads, which is a problem esp. for mobile connections. A common solution seems to be to allow multiple requests with offsets to write parts of the file, and server implementations that also write data from aborted requests. (Examples: [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation#files-upload_session-start dropbox API], [http://tus.io/ tus.io protocol] (attempt to standardize such a protocol))

== Desktop upload ==
Some browsers support uploading images from a laptop/monitor camera:
