A '''<dfn>port forward</dfn>''' is a configuration option on most routers that allow requests to enter a private network, and may be useful (or even necessary) for running a [[home server]] like for your personal site. 

More specifically, when a router configured with a port forward receives a request directed to its public IP and the configured port number, it will forward the request to a predetermined server and port within the private network.

== Why ==
{{section-stub}}
If you serve your personal site from your home, you may need to configure your home internet router with a port forward to direct incoming requests to your [[home server]].

In the past, collaboration on some peer to peer collaborative editing tools (e.g. Subethaedit) required the hosting the shared document to setup a port forward.

== How to ==
{{section-stub}}
Configuring port forwarding is highly router dependent, doing a web search for your model of home internet router and the phrase port forward should help you find the necessary documentation.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

None so far.

Have you setup a port forward e.g. to your [[home server]]?
