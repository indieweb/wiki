'''<dfn>[https://github.com/fguillot/picoFeed picoFeed]</dfn>''' is an unmaintained, open source [[PHP]] library to parse and write feeds, formerly used in [[Miniflux]].

== h-feed support ==
* {{gRegor}} was working on a pull request to add [[h-feed]] support as of 2016-04. [https://github.com/fguillot/picoFeed/issues/264]
** As of 2017-12, picoFeed is no longer used in Miniflux and not maintained, so I will not likely continue.
