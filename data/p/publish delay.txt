'''<dfn>publish delay</dfn>''' (<dfn>send delay</dfn> in [[messaging]] systems) is a feature where new posts or messages are kept as [[draft]]s for a brief time before being published, allowing the user to cancel or edit them before they are published or sent.

== Why ==
Publish delay is a useful way to implement "Undo publish" or "Undo send" in messaging systems.

Such "undo" features help provide a more forgiving [[UI]], which tends to be friendlier.

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} has done this in the past by setting the `published` to a time in the future, which then does not get built by his site until after that date.

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Gmail]] calls it "Undo Send", with adjustable timeouts of 5-30 seconds before an e-mail is actually sent out.
* [[GMX]]'s webmail interface has this feature.
* [[Hacker News]] calls it "timeout", a freely chosen number of seconds before posts become actually visible to other users.
