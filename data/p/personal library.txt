A '''<dfn>personal library</dfn>''' is an online [[collection]] of [[book]]s that reflects either physical or digital items one owns, wants to [[acquisition|acquire]], has [[bookmark]]ed to [[read]], is currently reading, or read in the past. Sometimes they're maintained as [[archive]]s and others are maintained as [[collection]]s on individual [[page]](s).

For pages about [[read]] posts or [[book]]s distributed or readable online, please see those pages and examples.

Sawyer Hollenshead keeps a digital personal library at https://highlights.sawyerh.com/
<blockquote>After stewing in frustration for quite awhile about the current state of digital reading platforms, I decided to do what any sane programmer would do: Devise an overly complex solution for a seemingly simple problem. The prompt: How might I gather all my highlights from Kindle and put them into a personal online archive, where I can share, browse, and reflect on everything Iâ€™ve read? The result: highlights.sawyerh.com</blockquote>

== Brainstorming ==

=== How to mark up ===
* Thoughts?

* Maintaining [[DRY]] principles with relation to [[read]], [[bookmark]], [[acquisition]] and other similar posts.

=== Reading list ===
Is there anything special about keeping a reading list beyond what you have in your personal library?
E.g.
* items in your personal library you want to (re)read
* items you want to (temporarily) acquire to read
** borrow from a friend
** checkout from a public library

==== Notes from {{jacky}} 2021-03-22 08:35 AM PST ====

Digital reading lists can be more rich than the conventional approach. Keeping track of when I paused on a book and to see when would be a good time to resurface it would be helpful (probably manually done). Also being able to see what other books my friends have kept on their lists could also help with getting back into them
