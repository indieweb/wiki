A '''<dfn>personal library</dfn>''' is an online [[collection]] of [[book]]s that reflects either physical or digital items one owns, wants to [[acquisition|acquire]], has [[bookmark]]ed to [[read]], is currently reading, or read in the past. Sometimes they're maintained as [[archive]]s and others are maintained as [[collection]]s on individual [[page]](s).

For pages about [[read]] posts or [[book]]s distributed or readable online, please see those pages and examples.
