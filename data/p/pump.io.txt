== IndieWeb Compatibility ==

pump.io uses its own protocol for communicating between servers, based on ActivityStreams. There are no known examples of communication to/from indieweb sites.

[https://e14n.com/evan Evan P] ''has'' [http://bret.io/2013/08/08/t5/ expressed interest] in pump.io communicating via indieweb style [[comment | comments]].

Modern pump.io versions support [[microformats]] out-of-the-box. {{strugee}} (pump.io maintainer) has expressed interest in ''sending'' [[webmentions]] via a [[bridge]].
