'''<dfn>People</dfn>''' are the root reason for the existence of the IndieWeb and many of the guiding [[principles]] are built around this idea.

<blockquote>The IndieWeb is a [[people]]-focused alternative to the "corporate web".</blockquote>

Below are some resources for helping you to connect with, meet, following, or interact with others in the IndieWeb community.

== Connecting with Others ==
=== Chat ===
There is a bridged chat that spans multiple modalities to allow people a variety of ways of interacting online via chat to communicate about the IndieWeb. Join the [[discussion]] now via web interface, Slack, IRC, or even Matrix.

=== Events ===
[[Events]] are a great way to meet people in real life and directly discuss and demonstrate what you've done with your personal website. There are two big types of organized events to do this at:
* [[IndieWebCamp]]
* [[Homebrew Website Club]]
Be sure to check them out. Here's the link to the [[next-hwc|next Homebrew Website Club]] meeting.

=== Following People Online ===
* {{mblaney}} has created an IndieWeb [[planet]] for following many people's sites. It's at [https://unicyclic.com/indieweb/ https://unicyclic.com/indieweb/] 
* {{chrisaldrich}} has compiled an [[OPML]] list of IndieWeb adherents frequently in the chat or talking about IndieWeb which one can either import or subscribe to in a feed reader. It's available at http://boffosocko.com/wp-links-opml.php?link_cat=1521
