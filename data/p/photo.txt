{{stub}}

<div class="p-summary">A '''<dfn>photo</dfn>''' is a [[post]] whose primary content is a photograph or other image, with an optional caption. With multiple photographs it becomes a [[multi-photo]] post.</div>

A [[photo upload]] is typically how photo posts are created.

The term ‚Äúphoto‚Äù can also refer to a [[profile photo]].

== Why ==
You should own your photos like you own any other content you create. Many photos sites have [[site-deaths|gone down]] over the years, taking invaluable personal memories with them.

== How ==
There are different approaches to posting photos. E.g.
* As a [[note]] with a primary image
* As an image, with text (caption) only following
** the image is the focus of the post, and text is in service of the image.
* Hosting variations - image files hosted on
** your primary webhost/domain
** a "photos." subdomain of your domain that maps to a cloud/CDN service like [[Amazon]] [[S3]] or [[Akamai]].
** as Creative Commons licensed content uploaded to [[Wikimedia]]

=== How to markup ===
(stub section)

Be sure to markup your actual photo image (or hyperlink to higher quality image) <code>class="u-photo"</code>. A photo post could look like this:
<pre><div class="h-entry">
  <img class="u-photo" src="photo.jpg">
  <p class="p-content">Look at this awesome sunset!</p>
  <p>published on <time class="dt-published">2013-03-07</time> by <a href="/" class="u-author">me</a>
</div></pre>

(could be rephrased better) This also means, don't go marking up every random image in every random post with "u-photo", unless you really want every random post being mistaken for a photo post.

=== Tagging ===
Tagging (AKA annotating) photos, initially popularized by [[Flickr]], has become a key motivation for publishing photos. Here are a number of ways you can tag photo posts, both directly in a post, and as a response to a photo post!

Implemented / in practice:
* [[tag]] / [[tag-reply]] - tag a photo with a word or phrase
* <span id="People_Tagging">[[person-tag]]</span> / [[person-tag-reply]] - tag a photo with a person

Research / Brainstorming:
* [[location]] / [[location-of]] - setting/suggesting the location of a photo is colloquially referred to as tagging a photo with a location. 
* [[area-tag]] / [[area-tag#area_tag_reply|area-tag-reply]] - tagging a specific area of a photo, either with text, or a person-tag.
Consider adding research from analyzing [[IIIF]] prior and current work.

=== POSSEing ===
[[POSSE]]ing photo posts makes sense certainly to photo [[silos]] like:
* [[Flickr]] - as a backup, for Creative Commons distribution
** Bridgy Publish [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/432 supports POSSEing to Flickr]!
* [[Instagram]] (as much as you can fake a POSSE post to Instagram using [[ownyourgram]] to PESOS then link back to the IG photo with [[u-syndication]])
* [[Wikimedia Commons]] - as a [[commons]] rather than a silo, it may make sense to start POSSEing here as a backup/distribution/CDN mechanism

In addition, it makes sense to POSSE to generic silos, despite the fact that they will only retain a (likely) lower resolution copy of your photo:
* [[Twitter]] - as a native Twitter photo tweet  for your friends on Twitter to see your photos
** using TwitterAPI, or
** using Bridgy Publish[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/85]
* [[Facebook]] - similarly for your friends on Facebook to see your photos
** using Bridgy Publish[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/85] - which also supports copying over person-tags (of anyone person-tagged with their indieweb site who is signed up on Bridgy, or with Facebook profile URLs with profile IDs)

==== POSSE person tags ====
You should POSSE any [[person-tag]]s on your photo to any POSSE copy as well.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Sorted by earliest photo posts first.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
[[User:Snarfed.org|Ryan Barrett]] uses [[WordPress]] to post photo posts on [https://snarfed.org/pictures snarfed.org/pictures] since around [https://snarfed.org/draw_group 2003-03-06] and [[multi-photo]] posts [https://snarfed.org/2014-12-23_12146 since 2014-12-23]. Examples:
* https://snarfed.org/draw_group
* multi https://snarfed.org/2014-12-23_12146
** very much looks like a photo
** no explicit photo post markup, rather, it's marked up as an [[article]] with a nested [[check-in]] inside.
** Facebook POSSE: https://www.facebook.com/snarfed.org/posts/10101422243050323
*** as a multi-photo post with location information (rather than a check-in) with individual photo permalinks:

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] to publish photo posts [http://tantek.com/2015/244/t1/did-entire-npsf-trackattack since 2015-244] which are [[note]] posts with an embedded image that have been auto-upgraded to being photo posts. He does the following:
# Usually uses [[Swarm]] iOS client to add semi-public photos to checkins. See [[Falcon#Sample_Post_Creation_Flow|Falcon: Sample post creation flow]] for more details.
#* Sometimes to Wikimedia commons instead.
#* Sometimes to IndieWebCamp wiki instead.
# Writes & posts a [[note]] on his own site that starts with a direct .jpg URL of the photo image, then a space/linebreak, then permalink of the Instagram post, then caption.
# That "note" is auto-upgraded by [[CASSIS]]'s <code>auto_link</code> function into a photo post by putting the <code>u-photo</code> class name on the [[auto-embed]] <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> of the JPG, since it's the first URL in the "note".
# Falcon automatically uses [[Bridgy]] Publish to [[POSSE]] the photo as a photo post to [[Twitter]]  and [[Flickr]] ([http://tantek.com/2016/032/t1/mothership-bowl-second-breakfast since 2016-02-01], manually [https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/23803704613/ since 2016-01-16] of a [http://tantek.com/2016/001/t1/gregorian-january-lego-calendar 2016-01-01 photo]), saving the resulting syndication URLs in storage. Manually POSSEing to Instagram.

** POSSEd as note to Twitter: https://twitter.com/t/status/638755285159559168
*** abbreviated text, with permashortlink to full post on own site
** Manually POSSEd as photo to Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101862796233213
*** with entirety of text, including whitespace like line-breaks.

** Manually POSSEd as photo to Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101877363580133
Since this was an auto-upgrade change, it is likely that there are older notes that got upgraded to photo posts as well.

=== Ryan Rix ===

{{rrix}} uses [https://indiewebcamp.com/User:Notes.whatthefuck.computer#Arcology Arcology] to publish photos through his site and syndicate them out to Facebook and Twitter using [[Bridgy]].

=== Jay Robinson ===

{{j4y_funabashi}} is backfilling his site with ~10 years worth of photos
* I think this is the first photo I posted http://j4y.co/p/20160405164556_5703ddb45dbf0

=== Marty McGuire ===

{{martymcguire}} uses [[Quill]] with a custom micropub handler to post photos (with notes).
* First example: https://martymcgui.re/2016/04/28/133049/

Marty is also displaying interactive 360 photospheres (panoramic images in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection equirectangular projection], common in cameras like the [https://theta360.com/en/about/theta/ Ricoh Theta S]). In browsers with Javascript enabled, the panoramic images are upgraded to an interactive [https://github.com/google/vrview Google VR View].
* First example: https://martymcgui.re/2016/08/28/114014/
* Panoramas work like a regular photo post with a couple of exceptions:
** The large image size can lead to failed uploads or server rejections
** A panoramic photo is differentiated from a non-panoramic photo by EXIF XMP tag "ProjectionType=equirectangular"

=== Jason Garber ===

** Twitter copy includes title and link back to original's URL
* Automated POSSE to [[Facebook]] using [[IFTTT]]
* Manual POSSE to [[Instagram]] using a custom [[Workflow]] (iOS app) action

== Notes with image examples ==
[[Notes]] with embedded photos that are not marked up with <code>u-photo</code> are similar to photo posts.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] to post photos on [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] since at least [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/686/ 2012-12-13] as notes with embedded images.
* 2017-07-21: the image src in this post is dead currently

== Discussion ==
* {{gRegor}}: I don't understand the distinction between 'photo' and 'note with photo.' It was suggested in chat by [[User:Mowens.com|mko]] that a 'photo' post would be a photo with no other content. However, this page indicates caption text may follow the photo. Per discussion, the caption would be the p-summary/p-name of the photo post. This seems to make it no different than a regular note, then, as far as microformat parsing. Example: http://gregorlove.com/notes/2014/07/15/2/ ‚Äî [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-15#t1405445144 IRC log]
** Per further discussion, mko explained that the caption would not appear in the e-content, as it does in my example. He offered these code examples to demonstrate the difference: https://gist.github.com/mko/f05e8cb0d2423f6deaa7

* On a photo post, text is directly "related to the photo", where text in a note can be "conversational" or tangential. <blockquote>&lt;mko> Another example, from my own experience. I was the design lead at hi5. We did research into how users were using the Photos feature versus the Status Update feature (which had the ability to post a photo). Users posted photos without any text the vast majority of the time. When users posted status updates with photos, on the other hand, they almost never did so without accompanying text. On top of that, we found that when there was text accompanying a photo in the Photos section, it was almost always a caption related to the photo (with very few exceptions), whereas those in a status update that would go on the Friend Feed typically was conversational and not directly related to the photo.</blockquote>[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-15#t1405447134]

* [[User:kartikprabhu.com|Kartik]]: I do not understand what would be the UI/UX difference in posting/reading a "photo with caption" vs "note with photo" ? Some examples (silo/indieweb) distinguishing these cases would be good.
** [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]: I would consider [https://kylewm.com/note/2014/05/05/1 this post about going to a museum] a note with a photo that is not a photo post &mdash; The text stands alone; the image is secondary[[File:kylewm-note-with-photo-2014-07-15.png|none|thumb|A note with a photo]]
** [[User:Wwelves.org perpetual-tripper|Wwelves.org perpetual-tripper]] facebook  [https://www.facebook.com/social.w3.org/posts/869811893104078 example of posting with embedded photo, which in turn has its own description] [[File:posting+embedded-photo.png|none|thumb]]

== Silos ==
The following [[silos]] specialize in photo posting/hosting/sharing:
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Wikimedia Commons]]

In addition, the following silos support photo posts in addition to other types of posts:
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Google+]]

Here are some notes on specific silo treatment of photos:

=== Facebook ===
With Facebook, you have the options of:
* creating an actual [[photo]] post (preferred)
** Note that the [[POSSE_to_Facebook#See_Original]] trick does not work with photo posts
* or posting a status update ([[note]]) and linking to the original photo or if you're linking to a permalink on your own site (e.g. as part of [[POSSE]]ing), optionally using [[OGP]] to specify the image to use for a preview.<br>[[File:facebook-post-with-preview-image.png|none|thumb|Facebook note with preview image]]
Creating an actual photo post looks much better.
More detail: [[POSSE_to_Facebook#Posting_Photos_via_the_Facebook_API]]

== Brainstorming ==
{{main|photo brainstorming}}  (why? should this be re-incorporated here until there's a good reason to move a subsection to a separate page? brainstorming things should eventually migrate to actual things so moving them to a separate page is a step backwards. <span class="h-card" style="white-space:nowrap">{{sparkline|https://twitter.com/t/profile_image}} [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek √áelik]]</span> 18:12, 22 December 2017 (PST))

=== POSSE ===
More brainstorming about POSSEing photos!

==== Distinguishing Photos from Notes ====
[[Bridgy]] Publish has a concrete use-case where it would be useful to mechanically differentiate posts where the photo is primary, vs. notes with an included image that is not the focus of the note. Photo posts should be POSSEd as '''native''' photo post types on [[Facebook]] and included as attached media on [[Twitter]]. POSSEd notes would prefer to link to the original post, and possibly include the image as a [[link-preview]].

The problem is that both types have the same mf2 representation: p-name/e-content for caption and u-photo for the image.

Simplest solution is to treat all <strike>posts</strike> notes with a <code>u-photo</code> as photo posts.
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/85 Bridgy resolution on this in GitHub.]

==== Why POSSE rather than TwitterCard ====
(Not sure if this belongs here or on [[Twitter]] page, but capturing as part of this for now.)
Advantages to POSSEing actual photos to Twitter, rather than just a link to a photo post on your site with Twitter [[Cards]] metacrap markup:
* Further distribute the use of Twitter kind of like a CDN for your photos
* People see a larger version of the photo via a phototweet than a Twittercard
* Usual avoid [[metacrap]] (silo-specific meta tags) advantage
* Photo tweets appear inline in tweet list views (e.g. Twitter timeline / homepage) whereas twitter cards won't appear inline automatically (require twiddling open).
* Photo tweets work immediately, whereas photo cards require that Twitter whitelist your domain for cards in general (and maybe in particular for photo cards?)
* Using the TwitterAPI hides the proprietariness, whereas using twittercards means your own website has proprietary metacrap on it
* Twittercards set a worse example (proprietary metacrap) for others that may view source

=== backfeed person tags ===
If you're POSSEing photo posts, in addition to normal backfeed support of silo [[like]], [[repost]], [[reply]] responses, you should also support backfeeding [[person-tag]]ging on your POSSE photo copies.

Two reasons why:
# Your own convenience / ease of use. Some silos have nice/easy person-tagging UIs, i.e. that often auto-suggest who to tag in a photo with a simple one button (Yes) UI to do it (as you select/hover faces), e.g. [[Facebook]]. Thus it may be easier to implement backfeeding person-tags than implementing your own person-tagging UI (and facial recognition support too!)
# Person-tags from friends. Some silos let your friends tag people they know in your photos (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]]), and thus they're likely to do so. You should backfeed these person-tags from your friends back to your original photo post.

Bridgy backfeed does not yet support backfeeding person tags from POSSE copies of photo posts.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-01#t1441140760078]
* https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/488

=== Hosting ===
* {{gRegor}} When I start hosting my own photos, I have thought about using the Coral CDN. http://www.coralcdn.org/
** Note: [https://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/coral-users/2016-April/000648.html Coral CDN is offline as of 2016].
* {{t}} I'm hosting by using static private igx.4sqi.net JPG URLs currently (occasionally similar direct static JPG URLs from Wikimedia posts or IndieWeb uploads), but want to switch to my own images.tantek or photos.tantek etc. URLs that redirect. 
** [[Falcon#own_photo_src_URLs|Falcon: own photo src URLs]]
** More examples, details at [[photo#Tantek]] above.

=== How to markup caption ===
We need to collect the different ways people are marking up the caption of a photo post, e.g. in which properties (name, summary, content, several thereof?), in same property as u-photo images themselves (e.g. in e-content), and then come up with one or a few recommended ways to markup the caption of a photo.

==== Inside the e-content ====
* I have been wrapping the <code>img class="u-photo"</code> and caption in the <code>e-content</code> [https://gregorlove.com/2017/12/youre-gonna-wear-the-shirt/]. Mainly because I initially set up my templates to wrap the post's content that way -- for use with [[note]]s and [[article]]s. I'm open to changing that for photos. Currently, removing the <code>e-content</code> and putting the caption in a <code>p-name p-summary</code> sounds like a good recommendation. <span class="h-card">{{sparkline|https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/3473/profile-2016-med.jpg}}  [[User:Gregorlove.com|gRegor Morrill]]</span> 18:25, 22 December 2017 (PST)
