'''<dfn>packing</dfn>''' is a type of [[photo]] post that shows what you are packing or <dfn>packed</dfn> for a trip, typically with all the items spread out in neatly arranged, usually with the bag or backpack that they are being (or were) packed into.

Note that similar to a [[using]] page, a [[packing]] post is what you actually are packing / packed, not just "recommendations" to others for what they should pack. Showing a photo of all the things you packed / are packing helps demonstrate the authenticity of a packing post, beyond just a list of tips for what to pack.

That and everything else fit into the backpack, which just barely fits the CRJ200's much smaller than normal overhead storage compartment. #norollawaynoproblem #onelaptop #fromwhereijetset #nofilter</p>
