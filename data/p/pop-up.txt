A '''<dfn>pop-up</dfn>''' is a one-time [[event]], like a one-time [[IndieWebCamp]] session or a [[Homebrew Website Club]] at a new city or location, often to see how much interest there is before committing to a regular event.
 
With the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, semi-regular pop-up sessions were instituted to help bridge some of the gap in in-person camps throughout the year.
