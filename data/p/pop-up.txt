A '''<dfn>pop-up</dfn>''' is a one-time [[event]], like a one-time [[IndieWebCamp]] session or a [[Homebrew Website Club]] at a new city or location, often to see how much interest there is before committing to a regular event.

With the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, semi-regular online pop-up sessions were instituted. Part of this was due the uncertainty about scheduling in-person [[IndieWebCamp]] events for the immediate future. 

= In-Person Pop-Ups =

In-person Pop-up events would also often occur when one or more community members were in a city for another reason, and proposed a [[Homebrew Website Club]] event in that location. Sometimes, these pop-ups were adjacent to events that attracted parties with similar interests. 

= Online Pop-Ups =

The advantages of individual online sessions are:
* Ability to focus/schedule on one topic
* Sessions, not being part of a larger event, can be longer and more in-depth
* Opportunity to settle long-standing issues by scheduling events that can attract people from multiple parts of a worldwide community.

Typically, these events have been scheduled at least two weeks in advance and scheduled at a time that is practical for people living on the East and West Coasts of the United States, as well as Europe to attend, as these are where currently the largest populations of attendees.
