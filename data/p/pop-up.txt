=== Microformats Roundtable ===
Let's work through and discuss some of the open Microformats issue trackers. The proposal is to schedule 60, 90, or 120 minutes at a regular interval, either every month, every other month, or every 3 months, so we can finally address some of the long-standing microformats issues we have in the community. If we choose an alternating schedule, we can have different people from our various timezones each time.

Proposed:
* Name: Microformats Popup: Microformats2 Issues Resolution Session
* Description: (draft, feel free to edit/improve) <blockquote><p>Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.</p><p>Let's discuss how we can close out some outstanding microformats2 issues.</p><p>This is an intermediate session, with a prerequisite of basic knowledge of HTML and microformats. Experience with publishing and/or parsing is a plus. All are welcome.</p><p>More details will be posted over time</p></blockquote>

* Hack day?
* Demos?

==== Prerequisites ====

At the [[2020/Pop-ups/Microformats]] session, there were several takeaways that would be good to resolve before trying another session. Specifically,

* perhaps a flow diagram of how a property can advance from proposed > draft > core
* what are the requirements / is the process to iterate on a Proposed property?
* what are the requirements / is the process to iterate on a Draft property?
* explicit lists of steps to follow to add a proposed property (with example "what specific real world use-cases they are solving, preferably with a link to a step-by-step user scenario, e.g. demonstratable using existing non-standard / single-site / single-implementation tools"), and transition a property from proposed to draft to core
* GitHub [[project labels]] to indicate the current state, and next-action(s) for individual proposals
* perhaps a flow diagram of the process for how a whole new microformat is developed and can be advance into a draft proposal and further
** using [[h-app]] as a live example that is actively being supported
** update https://microformats.org/wiki/process#Exploratory_Discussions accordingly
** higher level reasons / discussions of when to explore a new property for an existing microformat vs a new microformat

If we do not at least have a detailed proposal on this to discuss, then any discussion of stabilization will not be successful.

----
=== Micropub ===
Description: A discussion of updates for the Micropub Spec and its Extensions

* Discuss formalizing the extension process inside the specification instead of outside, and establishing what is an 'official' vs a stable extension, and if things that are stable extensions should be added to the living standard and under what circumstances.
* Discuss proposed extensions
* Discuss errata

== Ideas ==
Review pop-up ideas that were proposed in past years but did not take place. If you're interested in any of them, start a new planning section above.

* [[2022/Pop-ups/Sessions]]
* [[2021/Pop-ups/Sessions]]

== Past ==
{{#categorytree:IWC Pop-ups 2024 Sessions|mode=pages|hideprefix=always}}
{{#categorytree:IWC Pop-ups 2023 Sessions|mode=pages|hideprefix=always}}
{{#categorytree:IWC Pop-ups 2022 Sessions|mode=pages|hideprefix=always}}
{{#categorytree:IWC Pop-ups 2021 Sessions|mode=pages|hideprefix=always}}
{{#categorytree:IWC Pop-ups 2020 Sessions|mode=pages|hideprefix=always}}

== Format ==
=== Online Pop-Ups ===
The advantages of individual online sessions are:
* Ability to focus/schedule on one topic
* Sessions, not being part of a larger event, can be longer and more in-depth
* Opportunity to settle long-standing issues by scheduling events that can attract people from multiple parts of a worldwide community.

Typically, these events have been scheduled at least two weeks in advance and scheduled at a time that is practical for people living on the East and West Coasts of the United States, as well as Europe to attend, as these are where currently the largest populations of attendees. 

==== Online Pop-Ups Background ====
With the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the community started organizing occasional online topic specific pop-up sessions, motivated by the uncertainty around scheduling in-person [[IndieWebCamp]] events for the immediate future. 

=== In-Person Pop-Ups ===
In-person Pop-up events would also often occur when one or more community members were in a city for another reason, and proposed a [[Homebrew Website Club]] event in that location. Sometimes, these pop-ups were adjacent to events that attracted parties with similar interests.
