A '''<dfn>private account</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] account where all posts on its profile are private, and only approved followers (or friends) can see posts.

Typical private account support:
* is purely binary, that is either all your posts are public or all of them are private.
* following a private account creates a request for approval, which then must be explicitly approved 
* switching from a public account to a private account keeps existing followers (and friends)

== Why ==
Why use (or switch to) a private account?
=== Prefer IndieWeb ===
'''Make people prefer IndieWeb.''' E.g. If you make your Instagram account private, but post your photos publicly on your own site, it encourages people to (re)share your public photo post permalinks instead of links to your photos on Instagram.

This is true for all kinds of [[posts]] wherever you [[POSSE]] them.

If you make your silo account private but post publicly on your own site, it encourages people to (re)share your public post permalinks instead of links to your POSSE copies.

=== Why Instagram Private Account ===
Why make your [[Instagram]] account private in addition to the general reasons above
* '''Step toward Instagram just as client.''' Making your Instagram account private is one step towards a world where you (only or primarily) use Instagram as a client for posting photos to your site, rather than a place for others to see your photos.
* '''Eliminate like and comment spam.''' There are tons of spam accounts on Instagram that do nothing but like and comment on your photos in the hopes that you will click through to their profiles and click their URLs, or people viewing your photos will do so! Going private prevents such drive-by like or comment spam.
* '''Unfriendly API changes.''' [[Instagram]] is becoming increasingly unfriendly (less open) with their API changes ([https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/65 details]).

# Check "[âœ“] Protect my Tweets" where it says just below it: <blockquote>If selected, only those you approve will receive your Tweets. Your future Tweets will not be available publicly. Tweets posted previously may still be publicly visible in some places. [https://support.twitter.com/articles/14016 Learn more].</blockquote> (needs screenshot)

Native retweets are disabled on private account tweets.

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] does not have a single "private account" on/off switch, but rather finer grained privacy controls per post, posts by default, etc. For more details, and how to set posts to private by default, old public posts to private, see:
