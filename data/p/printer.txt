A '''<dfn>printer</dfn>''' is a device that produces text or images on physical paper, and can be used to create a physical copy of a personal website or webmentions sent to a personal website.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* Printing h-cards https://jamesg.blog/2021/07/02/thermal-printer-hcard
* Printing webmentions received https://jamesg.blog/2021/06/22/thermal-printer-part-3
* Printing pages from the IndieWeb wiki https://jamesg.blog/2021/07/01/thermal-printer-project-indieweb-wiki

The aforementioned examples make use of [[thermal printing]] which do not require ink.

== Criticism ==
Some printers are designed to sell for low retail prices while the ink cartridges are expensive and proprietary in order to create recurring revenue to the manufacturer of the device.
