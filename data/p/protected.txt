'''<dfn>protected</dfn>''' is a type of account or post that requires at least signing-in to view, and typically only allows a specific set of people to view (and possibly interact with).

* Silo Example: https://twitter.com/falcontest is a "protected" Twitter account and it says "These Tweets are protected / Only approved followers can see @falcontestâ€™s Tweets. To request access, click Follow. Learn more"
* ^ "Learn more" links to [https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets About public and protected Tweets], which despite the "protected tweets" framing, is really about a protected vs public accounts, since flipping that setting affects all your tweets at once.
* [[private]] <- this needs to be refactored and the "protected" aspects of the [[private]] page need to be extracted and moved to here (protected page)
