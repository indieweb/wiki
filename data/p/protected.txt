{{stub}}

'''<dfn>protected</dfn>''' is a type of account or post that requires at least signing-in to view, and typically only allows a specific set of people to view (and possibly interact with).

== Examples ==

=== {{kylewm}} ===

[[Red Wind]] has rudimentary support for protected posts based on a simple list of the domains of people authorized to view a private post. The posts are viewable only if the [[IndieAuth]]ed user is in the audience list.

Example note from {{kylewm}}'s site:<br>[[File:kmahan-private-note-display.png|border|500px]]<p>[[Posting interface]]:<br>[[File:kmahan-private-note-edit.png|border|500px]]

=== {{aaronpk}} ===
[[p3k]] (v1) has support for protected posts by specifying a list of the domains of people authorized to view a private post. To view the post, the user must identify themselves with [[IndieAuth]] by signing in to the site. After signing in, a session cookie is set which identifies the user.

=== Becky Stern ===
[https://beckystern.com/ Becky Stern] supports protected posts on her site with an "Unlock with Patreon" login wall as of 2019-06-01. These allow her to post backers-only content for her [[Patreon]] on her personal site, rather than locking the content to patreon.com. This feature is provided by an official [https://wordpress.org/plugins/patreon-connect/ Patreon Connect] plugin for [[WordPress]].

=== {{beesbuzz.biz}} ===

[[Publ CMS|Publ]] has support for protected posts as of [http://beesbuzz.biz/3922 2019-07-13], using [[Authl]] as the authentication broker. This supports both IndieWeb and silo users (via Twitter, Mastodon), as well as login-by-email.

Users can be put into hierarchical groups, and posts can have their visibility made based on groups and individuals. See [http://publ.beesbuzz.biz/manual/formats/322-Entry-files#auth entry auth] and [http://publ.beesbuzz.biz/manual/706-User-authentication#user_list user/group configuration] for more information.

Publ also now (as of [http://publ.plaidweb.site/blog/301-Publ-0-6-9 2020-08-14]) provides a mechanism for retrieving a bearer token to provide to a feed reader; this can be seen on [https://beesbuzz.biz/profile fluffy's site], although at present no known feed readers support this (but it is tested working in cURL, at least).

* Silo Example: https://twitter.com/falcontest is a "protected" Twitter account and it says "These Tweets are protected / Only approved followers can see @falcontestâ€™s Tweets. To request access, click Follow. Learn more"
* ^ "Learn more" links to [https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets About public and protected Tweets], which despite the "protected tweets" framing, is really about a protected vs public accounts, since flipping that setting affects all your tweets at once.
* [[private]] <- this needs to be refactored and the "protected" aspects of the [[private]] page need to be extracted and moved to here (protected page)
