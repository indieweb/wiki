'''<dfn>[https://pnut.io/ pnut]</dfn>''' is a short-messaging social network silo in which messages have a limited length, and you can follow folks, and be followed by folks. 

It's similar to [[App.net]] and [[Twitter]]. Access was free by invite-only but since July 2017 membership is available without an invitation. The community is small, and sustainable as a hobby. Hopefully this can help it be an enjoyable, useful place.

Features include:
* Posts are limited to 256 characters
* Asymmetric following
* Private messaging, group messaging, and arbitrary streams
* 2017-07-25 v.0.6.0 of the service added microformats2 to pnut.io posts and profiles [https://pnut.io/docs/changes#2017-07-25.a blog post]

There is an [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/736 issue filed] to [[Bridgy]] to support [[backfeed]] in the future.
