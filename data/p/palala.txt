'''<dfn>Palala</dfn>''' is a public-timeline project for IndieWeb at https://indieweb.news/ being spearheaded by {{bear}}.

The goal is to create a [[public timeline]] of anything that is pushed to it or that it pulls h-feeds - ala the Twitter public timeline or what are called [[planet]]s in the traditional RSS/Atom feed world.

== Inputs ==
* [[webmention]] -- in the Bridgy style you can place a hidden https://indieweb.news/publish link

== API ==
* Retrieving items for a domain

== Todo ==
* [[h-feeds]] -- any known IndieWeb domain will be scanned for new items
** Perhaps from [[chat-names]], or perhaps preferably: '''Recent Logins from the past year.'''
* [[PuSH]]
* [[micropub]] -- need to chew on this idea
* API - Retrieving items for a given date range
* authenticated endpoint to mute or remove any items or domain
* register an endpoint to receive updates via push, xmpp, irc ???
* ???

== Name ==
The name Palala is from the Lephalale (Sotho) word "one that inundates".
