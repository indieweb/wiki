{{stub}}

'''<dfn>photo stream</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn>photo feed</dfn>) a page showing a series of photo posts, sometimes presented as a [[photo grid]], typically for the purpose of showing and catching up with that photos someone has taken and posted recently, without their other [[posts]] interspersed.

== Why ==
(this section is a stub, feel free to add your own reasons why!)

* {{t}}: 
** I think having, sharing, and showing such a page would demonstrate the power of owning your own design on the IndieWeb — and how we make things just as beautiful as any [[app]].
** Visualize a [[100 days]] of Photos project at least while it’s happening
* ...

== How to ==
(this section is a stub, please contribute specific steps you’ve taken to build and publish your own photo stream!)

See [[photo grid]] for a currently popular presentation of a photo stream, and examples for inspiration.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
See [[photo_grid#IndieWeb_Examples|photo grid: IndieWeb Examples]] for photo stream pages where the photos are displayed as a grid, which is quite common.

Feel free to add any non-grid IndieWeb photo stream examples here!

** For the [[100 days]] of Photos project use-case:
*** provide URLs to link to a specific start date or end date to show a photo stream from or before a certain date
*** provide a way to show the next (or previous) n (like 100) items in the stream
*** or provide both start and end dates (or number of days) instead of a specific number of items
