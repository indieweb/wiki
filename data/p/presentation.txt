A '''<dfn>presentation</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>slide deck</dfn>''' is an online version of the visual portion of a demonstration typically presented in person at a conference, workshop, or other [[event]]. At in person presentations slides are often projected onto a screen for easy viewing.

Typically a presenter will post a copy of their slides before or after a presentation to allow users to view them either after-the-fact for follow up or they may post them contemporaneously to allow remote-viewers a better experience. Some people may keep copies of their presentations online as part of their [[portfolio]]. Some conferences may request a copy of one's presentation or a link to for viewing after the event.
