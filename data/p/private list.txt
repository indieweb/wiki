'''<dfn>private list</dfn>''' is a reader feature that allows a user to add people to follow without disclosing that she is following them, either to them or others, and is implemented as a Channel in [[Aperture]], as well as the eponymously names feature in [[Twitter]].

* use-case: follow people to keep track of what theyâ€™re up to without seeming to show approval (like showing up in the [[followers you know]] box when others view their profile) and without worrying about retaliation or other forms of negative attention.
