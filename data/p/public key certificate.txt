A '''<dfn>public key certificate</dfn>''' (often just <dfn>certificate</dfn> or <dfn>cert</dfn>) is a digital certificate used to prove the ownership of a public key. Typically used as part of [[Transport Layer Security]] protocol layered on top of [[HTTPS]] to establish a secure communication channel between your your indieweb site and the browser.  

A TLS certificate that can be used for [[HTTPS]] must be explicitly [[HTTPS#Obtain|obtain and managed]], or have your [[webhost]] do so for you.
