A '''<dfn>planet</dfn>''', in the context of the indieweb, and blogs/feeds for even longer, is a site that aggregates feeds/updates from a variety of sources, typically focused on a particular topic or community.

== Why ==
Similar to a [[public timeline]], a planet provides an easy way to get an overview or introduction to a topic or community.

== How ==
One way to build an indieweb-style planet is to use a [[reader]] that allows public access to view the page. This can be done using [[dobrado]], where an account is required to manage the subscription list but the page containing the feed list can be made public.

=== markup ===
Question {{sknebel}} 2017-03-24: How should posts on a planet be marked up? Should the planet [[repost]], or just produce an [[h-feed]] reproducing the posts (and u-uid and u-url pointing to the canonical source?

* [[repost]] if full content is reproduced, [[h-cite]] otherwise, per [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2017-03-24#t1490387558605000 IRC discussion].
* per later discussion, u-uid = original_post should be enough. also doesn't show up as repost on every post and is still detectable via Webmention. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-04-10#t1491837069346000]

Atom specified a <code>source</code> property to indicate the original source of a post it republished. [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.11]

=== Webmention backfeed ===
(accidential) interaction with the planet post instead of the original could be redirected by the planet’s webmention endpoint -> just re-send it to the original post’s, if wants to receive them it can add the URL of the syndicated copy to the list of URLs it accepts webmentions for.

== Examples ==
Example "planets":
* http://planet.mozilla.org/
** {{t}}’s [[article]] posts are aggregated into this planet
* https://www.drupal.org/planet
** Aggregates a tag from each included blog
* https://unicyclic.com/indieweb
** Subscribes to all feeds found from members of the community
* ...

== Brainstorming ==
There have been various brainstorming discussions about planets, in particular, about the potential of building an IndieWebCamp Planet site, based on signups on this page:

=== IndieWebCamp Planet ===
Welcome to the IndieWebCamp Planet sign-up page.

{{chrisaldrich}} maintains an [[OPML]] file which includes a number of active IndieWeb members' sites and RSS/Atom links for easy subscription. http://boffosocko.com/wp-links-opml.php?link_cat=1521

There's also a [https://github.com/snarfed/indie-map/blob/master/crawl/domains.txt text-based list] from [[indie map]] that could potentially be used.
