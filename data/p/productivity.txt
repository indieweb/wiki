* 2021-07-27 WIRED: [https://www.wired.com/story/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools/ Hundreds of Ways to Get S#!+ Done—and We Still Don’t] / You want to be productive. Software wants to help. But even with a glut of tools claiming to make us all into taskmasters, we almost never master our tasks. <blockquote><p>Zeigarnik found a quirk of the human mind: When a task is unfinished, we can’t seem to stop thinking about it. … </p><p>Psychologists still argue about why; possibly it’s a kind of constant refresh to keep whatever’s pending from vanishing from our short-term memory… </p><p>Whatever the cause, today this is known as '''the Zeigarnik effect''', and psychologists who study task management say it’s part of why so many of us feel perpetually frazzled by the challenge of organizing work and life.
