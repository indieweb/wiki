* The subject line of the email becomes the post name

In WordPress, these settings are under '''Settings → Writing''' and are available in self-hosted or [[WordPress.com]] sites.

Summary of their documentation: <blockquote><p>Use your own unique address to email content directly into your Flickr account from your cameraphone or your email program.</p><p>'''Descriptions and Tags'''</p><p>You can use the subject line to give your photo or video a title and the body to add a description. You can also [https://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#140 use a special code] to add tags before you send your email.</p><p>'''Photo/Video Privacy'''</p><p>Emailed content inherits your default privacy settings, unless you set it as you send the email [https://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#1873514 using these instructions].</p></blockquote>

The "special code" to add tags: <blockquote><p>Just type "tags:" in the subject line or body of the email followed by the list of tags you want added to the photo(s). (The rest of the subject line in is converted to the photo's title and the body of the email becomes the photo's description.)</p><p>[...]</p><p>Subject:	Lucy, my new cat   tags: cute "black cat"</p><p>[...]</p><p>Or you could send them in the body</p></blockquote>

For customizing photo privacy "using these instructions", you add a "+(privacylevel)" to the email address, e.g.
