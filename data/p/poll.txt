A '''<dfn>poll</dfn>''' is a post type that facilitates responses to be aggregated into a final set of votes, usually offering between two and four options from which users can choose. Polls are commonly used on social networks such as Twitter and Instagram.

== Why ==

You may want to publish a poll on your personal website to get answers to a question on your mind from your readers. This could cover anything from questions about your blog to quiz questions (which could be part of a challenge) to a question you have about something on your mind.

== How ==

There is no single way of publishing a poll that is accepted and recognized by the IndieWeb community. So far, we have agreed a poll should be started in a [[h-entry]] and accept votes through Webmentions. The community is still discussing the most effective way to run a poll.

=== capjamesg's Approach ===

{{capjamesg}} phrased a question in a blog post then allowed readers to vote on an answer by using a Webmention. He did not use any special markup to make it as easy as possible to test asking a question that supported answers from readers. More information is provided in the "IndieWeb Examples" section below.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} started a poll on his blog on May 17, 2022. The poll asked how much coffee his readers drank. To vote, readers must submit a Webmention to the URL with the option for which they want to vote. James plans to aggregate the results manually and share them on his blog while considering different ways to automate the process.

== Brainstorming ==

* How should one ensure that the same domain does not send multiple Webmentions to try and manipulate the outcome of a question (assuming Webmentions are used for the polling logic)?
* Ways to accept responses to a poll
** Look for #1 #2 #3, etc. strings of text in a Webmention sent to your post. Any "hashtag" followed by a number would be considered a vote for the question. If multiple hashtags are provided, logic would need to be in place to choose which one is the "authoritative" vote (or the vote could be ignored entirely).
** Ask participants to send Webmentions to different URLs. A new URL would correspond to an answer to a poll. This may be confusing for participants though.
** Ask participants to send Webmentions to a [[fragment]] on a page (i.e. example.com/poll#1). This would allow a Webmention receiver to receive all poll responses on the same page, which would make aggregation easier for poll publishers than having separate URLs for each method.
** Webmention marked up with a new property (but this involves creating markup when another solution can be used without markup).
