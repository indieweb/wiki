Pipes are a way of providing some value-add for IndieWeb tools that are useful as part of some other service.

== Use Cases ==

* Some IndieWeb members prefer to have their [[Micropub]] servers fairly unintelligent, and instead extend its functionality through other services.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* https://eventbrite-mf2.herokuapp.com - a pipe to provide MF2-JSON for a given [[Eventbrite]] event
* https://meetup-mf2.herokuapp.com - a pipe to provide MF2-JSON for a given [[Meetup]] event
* https://books-mf2.herokuapp.com - a pipe to provide MF2-JSON for a given book
* https://opengraph-mf2.tanna.dev - a pipe to provide MF2-JSON for a given URL's [[Open Graph]] metadata
* https://tiktok-mf2.tanna.dev - a pipe to provide MF2-JSON for a given [[TikTok]] video's metadata
* http://granary.io - a pipe to provide various formats such as AS2, MF2-JSON, and HTML for various services
* Many others - please add your own!

== Uses ==

* [[Koype]] has support for using pipes to parse URLs in incoming requests so links without MF2 can be liked and/or replied to
