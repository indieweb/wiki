'''<dfn>pubsub</dfn>''' is a generic name for a protocol, system, or service that routes messages between producers and consumers. It usually refers to one of three things:
* a system that notifies [[reader]]s that a [[publisher]] has published new content, e.g. [[PubSubHubbub]].
* a system that sends push notifications to users, e.g. [[iOS]]'s APN and [[Android]]'s [[GCM]].
* a category of [[plumbing]], e.g. [[Google Cloud PubSub]], [[Amazon SQS]] and other [[queue]] systems.

Subscribing to updates to a URL (ie the first definition above) is an extremely useful [[building-block]] for the indieweb. The rest of this page discusses that context.

== Generalised Flow ==

# Subscriber -> Publisher: Please let me know when you update http://example.org/
# Publisher -> Subscriber: Okay, now I’ve verified you’re not spam I’ll let you know

Later, after updating http://example.org/

# Publisher -> Subscriber: I updated http://example.org, here’s its new content

=== Problems with this flow ===

* Lots of load on the publisher: Subscription management, sending updates. Too much complexity, too low a value/pain ratio for most creators to implement
** Solution: Hubs as the middle man between subscribers and publishers

== Previous/Current Work ==

* [[PubSubHubbub]] is a decentralised, hub-based approach
** Widely implemented and suitably easy for publishers to use, but difficult to test
** Lots of complexity for subscribers
** Reliance on ATOM format, semantics and DRY-violating duplication

== Brainstorming ==

Ideal solution: a content-agnostic, pure-HTTP hub-based approach.

Publishers create content on the web, and let hub(s) know that it exists/when it’s updated via a POST request. Content is published with a Last-modified header.

Hubs periodically poll the content for changes (HEAD request and Last-modified header inspection) just in case they missed any updates/to enable pubsub of content published by people who for whatever reason can’t notify the hub.

Publishers publicly declare which hub manages notifications for their content via a Link header or HTML/XML element with rel=hub.

When a subscriber wants to subscribe to changes to a URL, they discover the hub as described above, and send a POST request to some endpoint (/subscribe?) with the URL they’re subscribing to and the URL they want notifications sent to.

* We need some sort of auth at this point to weed out spammers and enable the authenticity of future notifications.
* TODO: spec this stage out in more detail, take inspiration from current PuSH work

Then, when a publisher updates their content and either a) sends a notification to the hub or b) the hub polls the URL and sees the Last-modified header change, the hub sends POST requests out to all the subscribers for that URL.

* Possibly with the URL content as the POST body to prevent the Thundering Herd problem

=== Benefits over current solutions ===

* Eliminates DRY-violating duplication
* Content-agnostic, not tied to ATOM feeds but can be used with *any* content served over HTTP
* Extremely low barrier to entry for publishers — occasional hub polling of content eliminates the need to even send notifications to the hub to begin with
