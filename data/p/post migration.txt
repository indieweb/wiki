'''<dfn>post migration</dfn>''' is the ability to move your posts from one service or server to another, possibly by both [[export]]ing them into a static form from their existing location and [[import]]ing them to a new location, or by a form of direct data transfer between servers, ideally with the old location supporting [[permalink]] redirects for some period, and an aspect of [[data portability]] & [[migration]] in general.
