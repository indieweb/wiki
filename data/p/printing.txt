'''<dfn>printing</dfn>''' is a method of creating something offline from something online.

== Printing websites ==

Many websites don't consider making their content printer-friendly, [http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/archiving-a-website-for-ten-thousand-years/482385/ which can be useful for archival reasons]. It can also help people who might be less technical and would want paper overviews of data [http://indieweb.org/irc/2016-05-07/line/1462610647450].

See [[printed website]] for more.

== Styling prints with CSS ==

=== Add a stylesheet for print screen only ===
Add this to the <header> section of your site:

    <style type="text/css" media="print">[CSS goes here]</style>

=== Use an easy to read and/or easy to print font ===

Monospace can prevent confusing 0-s with O-s, l-s with 1-s, and so on.

    html {
        font-family: monospace;
        font-size: 9pt;
        line-height: 1.2em;
    }

=== Display URLs of hyperlinks ===

    a, a:visited, a:link {
        color: #000;
        text-decoration:underline;
    }

    a:after {
        content: "(" attr(href) ")";
        display: inline-block;
        width: auto;
        text-decoration: none;
        margin-left: 0.3em;
        font-style:italic;
    }

=== Hide all elements not needed for a print ===

Decorative images, those which are not part of the content, should not be printed to prevent waste.

    .element {
        display: none;
        visibility: hidden;
    }

=== Avoid low contrast and colours ===

While these may look stylish, they are hard to read and some printing methods do not support printing colours at all.
