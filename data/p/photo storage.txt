'''<dfn>Photo storage</dfn>''' is where you store uploaded photos on the internet, typically on a webserver, sometimes for [[photo hosting]] as well, or for the longterm, or backup purposes.

Photo storage is one step of many for creating a [[photo]] post, in roughly this order but sometimes with steps combined or re-ordered:
* [[photo capture]] - the act of taking a photo on a camera or mobile phone
* [[photo editing]] - editing a photo, often on a local device, often before uploading
* [[photo upload]] - sending a photo from a local device to some place on the internet
* [[photo storage]] - where you store photos that are uploaded, perhaps longterm, and backups
* [[photo hosting]] - where you serve photos displayed in [[posts]]

For UIs to [[create]] a photo post, see:

There are some folks that directly upload photos to their personal site for storage and hosting.

You can also store your photos on various [[silo]]s, typically in private accounts that no one else may view, as part of your photo post creation workflow.

=== Private POSSE ===
It is possible to [[POSSE]] photo storage via silo-specific APIs to private accounts on the following:
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Twitter]]
* [[Wikimedia Commons]] - the API is somewhat complex and undocumented, but for some images that meet [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/COM:SCOPE the project scope] and are licensed under free licenses (CC BY-SA, CC BY, CC0/PD or equivalent)
** So long as images are not deleted, you are able to store images there indefinitely, hot link them and use Commons to retrieve scaled versions.

Manual POSSEing is possible to the following:
* [[Facebook]] - due to posting APIs being dropped 2018-08-01.
* [[Instagram]] - has never had official posting APIs
