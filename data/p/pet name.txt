A '''<dfn>pet name</dfn>''' is a local, typically private, nickname or short-name that a person uses for another person or organization; mobile phone contacts entries are a common example, with user-defined names like “Mom”.

== Criticism ==
* {{t}} - I dislike the term “petname” because it sounds like whoever is making/using them is treating their contacts like pets, which is both a ridiculous and frankly patronizing framing. [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-23#t1543003023936400 reference from chat]
* {{eddiehinkle.com}} - I'm not really a huge fan of the term petname but I don't know that there is a better term. The definition of petname is "a term of address used to express affection" . [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-23#t1542952552554300 reference from chat]
** Since nickname is an array of strings, I might just make the first entry of nickname always be MY nickname, and any others in the array are nicknames from the person' h-card. I think anything more than nickname is really just trying to force it into a box that doesn't match
** In the US I think the term petname provides some assumption of silliness or intimacy. Like a high school couple might have "pet names" for each other.
* {{aaronpk}} -  I really don't like the term petname [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-23#t1542953039039200 reference from chat]
* {{gregorlove}} - I've only heard "pet names" in terms of nicknames for romantic partners. [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-23#t1543005119332000 reference from chat]
** I think "nickname" and "private nickname" work fine currently, don't necessarily need a new term. [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-23#t1543007847228500 reference from chat]
