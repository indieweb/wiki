For simpler services you can use to get on the IndieWeb without using a command line, see:
* '''[[Getting Started]]'''

__TOC__
Most projects are open source, if you’re looking for starting points in a particular [[programming language]], see:
* [[node.js]] | [[php]] | [[python]] | [[ruby]]

== Get On The IndieWeb ==
These projects are:
* IndieWeb [[friendly]]
* Actively in use by many
* Typically [[selfdogfood]]ed
* Can be installed on a website to get you on the IndieWeb
* Open source

In rough order of adoption and active use by the IndieWeb community:

=== Known ===

=== Bridgy ===
{{main|Bridgy}}
'''<dfn>[[Bridgy]]</dfn>''' is a service that [[backfeed]]s [[replies]] to your [[POSSE]] copies to your site, and publishes [[POSSE]] copies to your [[silo]] profiles.

== Get Inspired ==
These projects are:
* IndieWeb [[friendly]]
* Actively in use only by one or a few
* [[selfdogfood]]ed by their creator(s)
* Sometimes can be installed on a website to get you on the IndieWeb.
* At least somewhat open source

The following projects are actively being used at a minimum by their creators for their own personal sites ([[selfdogfood]]) and have excellent examples of IndieWeb sites both in [[design]], and [[IndieMark|IndieWeb feature support]].

These projects may not yet be easily installable by someone other than the creator(s).

These projects often provide [[building blocks]] functionality or more in the form of open source shared libraries or functions which can help bootstrap anyone looking to build their own IndieWeb solution.

Alphabetically ordered:

=== Dobrado ===
{{main|dobrado}}
'''[[dobrado]]''' is a multi user content management system written in PHP and Javascript. It's designed to make it easy to create and edit pages without any technical knowledge.

== Additional Site Options ==
These projects are:
* Not IndieWeb [[friendly]] by default (require additional work to interoperate)
* Actively in use by some (or on major sites)
* Sometimes [[selfdogfood]]ed by their creator(s)
* Sometimes can be installed on a website to get you on the IndieWeb.
* Sometimes open source, or source available to paid users

The following projects either may be production quality or have IndieWeb community members using them on their own domains, however likely require non-trivial additional work (possibly coding) to add IndieWeb support, and are often not selfdogfooded.

If you like challenges and helping people at the same time, these might be for you.

Try one out with your own site, and if you like it, jump in with code contributions to make it IndieWeb [[friendly]] (either by default or by following easy setup/plugin instructions), become an active developer on the project, and help elevate it up to [[selfdogfood]] status!

=== Libravatar ===
{{main|libravatar}}
'''[[libravatar]]''' is software that can provide independent avatar hosting (like Gravatar, but decentralized)

IndieWebCamp participants who are using it:

== Other Projects ==
Have you found another project that claims to be IndieWeb, or [[federated]], or [[decentralized]], or [[distributed]] and think it should be listed here or are not sure if it should be? Then:

=== Ask Questions ===
There are two pretty simple questions you can ask that will help you sift through perhaps 99% of the other projects out there.

# '''Are there human names of project creators on the project home page?'''
#* Does the project have actual humans behind it who are proud enough of it to put their names on it?
#** If the creators of the project are so unsure of it that they do not want to put their names on the home page, then you should likely also be skeptical about it. You can stop here.
# '''Are the creators [[selfdogfooding]] their project?'''
#* If you found the names of the actual humans behind the project, then you should be able to find their personal sites. If not, you can also stop here, because if the creators themselves do not have personal sites, it is unlikely that they (or their project) will empathize with those with personal sites.
#* Do their ''personal'' websites use their own project? This is perhaps the most important question for determining whether a project is real and usable or not. If the creators of the project themselves are not confident enough in their project to use it on their own personal sites, why should you?
#** Note the emphasis on ''personal'' website which is key to [[selfdogfooding]]. It’s nice (but not necessary, nor sufficient) that the project website (if any) uses the project itself (that would be just normal [[dogfooding]]).

If you have answered a firm YES to these two questions about a project, you may add that project to this page (like to the end of the [[#Get_Inspired|Get Inspired]] section) with names, personal sites, and citations of how those sites are using the project.

[[File:irc-personal-hub.png|300px|right]]
[[User:Aaronpk|Aaron Parecki]] uses a private IRC server with several channels as a personal communications hub. This project has no specific name, and has no single code base, and is highly experimental. However, he has been using and developing it for almost three years. 

The [http://aaronparecki.com/Loqi bot] in the IRC channel can control lights in the house, do text to speech on computers inside the house, shows Twitter mentions and wiki edits, do unit conversion and other calculations, manage a "todo" list, and sometimes makes snarky remarks.

Its modular structure has made it extremely easy to quickly add new functionality, and as such, has probably slowed Aaron's development on other more accessible web-based equivalents.

=== songlight ===
Some nasty bash scripts to support direct coding in HTML, by pointing out the mistakes. Dylan Harris uses it for [https://dylanharris.org arts & ego].

=== Other Hacks ===
Hacks that are not primary blogging / content hosting projects.

==== IndieWeb Messaging ====
Goal: Be able to send someone a short message only knowing their domain name. They should be able to receive the message in whatever way they want (SMS, Email, Twitter DM, etc.) without the sender knowing what medium the message will be sent through.

== Other ==
Here's where all other IndieWeb/FSW related projects go, including / especially those which are:
* not used by any IndieWebCamp participants
* or maybe just a spec (no code)
Despite their disused or theoretical nature, we may still be able to learn from the strengths and weaknesses of other approaches, document formats/protocols, etc. and try to merge efforts.

=== Diaspora ===
{{main|Diaspora}}

[[Diaspora]] is an open source project for hosting a social network on your own server that [[federates]] with other Diaspora instances, which are called "pods". 

IndieWeb community members who are using it on their own site:
* [[User:Exppad.com|Élie Michel]] tries to use it on its own pod, although the federation system does not completely convince him.

=== Ghost ===
{{main|Ghost}}

[https://ghost.org/ Ghost] is a simple and powerful blogging platform that was first written about by [http://john.onolan.org/ghost/ John O'Nolan], the former lead for Wordpress's UI team.

He described Ghost as an "idealistic and fictional concept for a WordPress-lite fork"[http://john.onolan.org/ghost/]. During a 29 day Kickstarter campaign, Nolan raised £196,362 [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform].

After two years, John O'Nolan released an article that described "How we Spent The Kickstarter Money, where we are now, and what's next for Ghost".[http://blog.ghost.org/year-2/]

Ghost is an open source application available for free self-hosting and offers Ghost(Pro), upon a premium managed-SaaS service hosted with [https://www.digitalocean.com/ Digital Ocean]. Ghost boasts a large community of [https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/graphs/contributors contributors], and runs as a [https://www.npmjs.com/ npm] module ontop of [https://nodejs.org/ NodeJS] and [http://expressjs.com/ Express].

=== GNU social ===
{{main|GNU social}}

GNU social is an open source project that "will be a decentralized social network that you can install on your own server".

No IndieWeb community members are using it on their own site.

=== OStatus for WordPress ===
[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ostatus-for-wordpress/ OStatus for WordPress] is a collection of plugins to make WordPress blogs followable by status.net and other OStatus instances.

No IndieWeb community members are using it on their own site.

If we could get IndieWeb participation by some folks using OStatus, it would be great to understand how well it works today.

=== Postcard ===
[http://www.postcardsocial.net Postcard] is an iOS app that allows you to post content on multiple social networks. It lets one network serve as the 'host' and the remaining networks share a link back to it.

The Postcard API Protocol also allows the app to communicate with your own site. A WordPress plugin that implements this API has been released along with the iOS app.

* [[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] [http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/02/19/2/indiewebcamp commented] to the developer on 2014-02-19, inviting him to join the IndieWeb conversation.
* No IndieWeb community members are currently using it on their own site.

=== Shaarli ===
{{main|Shaarli}}
[[Shaarli]] is a minimalist [[delicious]] clone you can install on your own website. It is designed to be personal (single-user), fast, and handy.

It is primarily a bookmarking application, but the feature list indicates you can also ". . . use it for micro-blogging (like Twitter), a pastebin, an online notepad, a snippet repository, etc."

IndieWeb community members who are using it on their own site:
* [[User:Upon2020.com|Johannes Ernst]] is using it since he moved from delicious.com, and he's not looking back!
* [[User:Exppad.com|Élie Michel]] uses it too.


===[[UBOS]] (Indie Box Project)===
http://ubos.net/ management software that allows the simple administration of IndieWeb sites on cheap Linux devices and plug computers.

[[UBOS]] is the successor to the former [[IndieBox]] project.

Used by:
* [[User:Upon2020.com|Johannes Ernst]] is using it at home for web applications used by his family. Those include OwnCloud, Shaarli, Selfoss, Wordpress, and some home-grown ones.

===Squiso===
{{main|Squiso}}
Squiso wants to create a decentralized open social web, by allowing users to host their own social data or trust a service provider of their choice.

Used and primary developed by:
* [[User:Indieauth.christoffer.me|Squeakytoy in IRC]]

== Services ==
These services are not projects that you can install and don't belong on the projects page, need to find a better place for them.

=== WordPress.com ===
[[WordPress#WordPress.com_hosting_service|WordPress.com]] is a hosted blog service that runs on [[WordPress]]. It includes [[microformats]] v1 by default, and you can author microformats2 by editing your template's HTML. You can also use [[Bridgy]] to send and receive [[webmentions]]. That combination makes WordPress.com a first-class (if limited) IndieWeb platform.

=== Tumblr ===
{{main|Tumblr}}

[http://tumblr.com Tumblr] is a hosted blog service. You can author [[microformats]] by editing your template's HTML, and you can use [[Bridgy]] to send and receive [[webmentions]]. That combination makes Tumblr a first-class (if limited) IndieWeb platform.

=== Blogger ===
{{main|Blogger}}

[https://www.blogger.com Blogger] is a hosted blog service. It includes [[microformats]] v1 by default, and you can author microformats2 by editing your template's HTML. You can also use [[Bridgy]] to send and receive [[webmentions]]. That combination makes Blogger a first-class (if limited) IndieWeb platform.

== Abandoned ==
See: [[former_projects#Abandoned]]

== About This Page ==
The [[projects]] page is focused on providing a clear flat list of projects you can set up on your own site to join the IndieWeb.

{{new}} Even more focus being considered on:
* curating it to be specifically about: "Projects incubated by and also actively in use by the IndieWeb Community" (and moving any other projects to subpages) per https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2018-06-19/1529430532439600
** ... (please provide feedback +1/0/-1 with name and preferably reasoning too) ...
** ...

=== Help Update This Page With ===
Some design thinking for this page. 
* Project inclusion requirements:
** IndieWeb community adoption and active use 
*** MUST have 1+ active user who is active in the community
*** MUST support 1+ key indieweb building blocks ([[microformats2]], [[Webmention]], [[Micropub]], what else?)
**** Can we rephrase this as an IndieMark level requirement? E.g. IndieMark Level 2+ only?
** [[selfdogfood]]

* Project ordering criteria:
** 1. What can I setup right now to '''get on''' the IndieWeb?
*** Prefer community member maintained projects over general tools
** 2. What projects have '''inspiring''' IndieWeb examples? For example,
*** Have a reasonably nice looking home page and permalinks
**** Must provide 1-3 real world live examples with thumbnail screenshots
*** Then ordered by apparent (actual in use) [[IndieMark]] level

* Each project listing should:
** list a few (1-3 max) IndieWeb examples actively using the project that are:
*** "tour-worthy" - sites you'd want to show someone new to the IndieWeb as clear examples of appealing / useful / empowering IndieWeb sites.
*** The nicest looking home page and permalinks (should have at least decent visual design / usability)
**** Why: https://twitter.com/rabble/status/661694752228667393 <blockquote>@kevinmarks Yeah, but i went through the indieweb ones and found them ugly. ;-D</blockquote>
*** preferably exemplary - i.e. be of high [[IndieMark]]
*** at least 1 selfdogfood example of (most) primary project developer
** link to complete list of active users on the actual project page "IndieWeb Examples" section

* Sections
** Get rid of release vs experimental vs. etc. This distinction was useful originally, but now # of active IndieWeb users acts as a better evaluation of project usability/usefulness. Many "experimental" projects are more useful/usable and advancing faster than officially released/stable projects.
*# Primary IndieWeb site software (e.g. Known, p3k, Publify, Taproot, Ferocity, Falcon)
*# Service hubs / proxies (e.g. webmention.io, brid.gy)
*# Open source frameworks, libraries used by the above, also being self-dogfooded, helpful building blocks for those who wish to build their own site software. See related mention in [[this-week-in-the-indieweb#Ideas|ideas for active projects]].

* Former Projects
** Move projects that fail inclusion requirements noted above to a separate page
** [[former projects]]

=== Avoid Cluttering This Page With ===
Please avoid cluttering this page with:
* "random crap I'm working on" - [[wikify]] that to your User page instead
* "random crap I found other people working on" - either:
** ask about it on [[IRC]] to see if anyone cares - if no one responds/cares - then don't add it to the wiki
** OR install such things yourself on your personal site, and document your experience on your User page
* Other directories of open source projects
** instead: look at specific projects in such directories and then see "random crap I found other people working on" above.

=== Formerly ===
Formerly this page was split into various categories as follows:

Split into production, experimental, hacks, and explorations as well as other for projects that are or appear to be IndieWeb related but are either not in use by any attendee or status is unknown.

Within each quality level the projects are listed by:
* Primary blogging / content hosting systems listed first, additional content hosting systems (e.g. for a specific content type only), and then other useful IndieWeb building block projects.
* Then by # of IndieWebCamp participants + other independents using each project.

Sorted within each quality level by number of IndieWebCamp participants actively using it on their primary self-identity site (thus you can quickly see which projects are the most "real", in-use, and likely well supported).
