'''<dfn>[https://pin13.net/ pin13]</dfn>''' is a collection of tools that aid in IndieWeb-friendly web development, including [[microformats]] parsing, character counting, JSON prettifying, and number converting.

It is operated by {{aaronpk}} as a personal scratch domain, but is used by many developers in the IndieWeb community to help debug issues when working on their own sites.

The name "pin13" is a reference to the [https://www.arduino.cc/ Arduino] microcontroller boards, which are hard-wired with an LED on pin 13 that can be controlled from software to allow debugging without any external components.
