A '''<dfn>podcast</dfn>''' is an episodic series of [[audio]] and/or [[video]] posts that can be subscribed to and downloaded for [[offline]] listening/viewing.

* '''[[podcasts about the indieweb]]'''

== Why ==
Why should you have a podcast? Some people like listening to them when:
* walking / running / [[exercise|exercising]] in general
* driving, e.g. on a roadtrip
* commuting (by any method)

== How ==

=== How to publish ===
Publishing a podcast usually involves publishing an RSS feed with episodes as items and linking to the audio file in the RSS <enclosure>. 

Once you've created the podcast RSS feed, you can submit it to one or more directories like Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, or you can give the feed URL to people directly and they can add it to most podcast player apps.

==== Use Granary ====
You can use [[Granary]] to convert the microformats on your podcast page to valid RSS feed.
* Make a 3000X 3000 image and mark it up with u-photo
* add size using dt-size
* add duration using dt-duration
* Visit granary, copy the link and use that to register with podcatchers
<pre>
    &#60;div class="h-feed" id="audiopoem"&#62;  
   &#60;h2 class="p-name">Poembox&#60;/h2&#62;
   &#60;p class="p-summary"&#62;A boombox of bad poems&#60;/p&#62;
   &#60;img class="u-photo" src="https://jgregorymcverry.com/photos/poemboxpodcastart.jpg" style="width:200px"&#62;
  &#60;time class="dt-updated" datetime="2020-02-25 11:14:20"&#62;25 &#60;sup&#62;th &#60;/sup&#62; February 2020 &#60;/time&#62;

=== How to consume ===
Podcasts are RSS/Atom/XML feeds where, normally, the media of the podcast is linked to with an enclosure tag
eg: <enclosure url="http://example.com/podcast01.mp3" length="259429328" type="audio/mpeg" />

However, most podcasts also include a number of other iTunes specific tags to ensure iTunes will subscribe to them easily, eg <itunes:summary>. Some of these iTunes tags are usually just replications of the data in other tags in the item.

Most podcast players both consume podcast feeds and play podcast audio. [[iTunes]] is the primary podcast player on OS X and iOS. Other platforms have other players, e.g. [http://beyondpod.com/ BeyondPod] and [http://antennapod.org/ AntennaPod] on [[Android]]. (See also [[podcatcher]])

Some podcasts only publish on iTunes. You can subscribe to them in other players with hacks like [http://picklemonkey.net/feedflipper-home/ Feed Flipper].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb examples of personal podcast publishing and consuming

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
{{benwerd}} has published podcasts on werd.io using [[Known]]
* First 2014-11-02: http://werd.io/2014/the-top-podcasts-are-professional-but-everyones-voice-should-be
* An RSS feed of all posts tagged #podcastsunday: http://werd.io/content/all/?q=%23podcastsunday&_t=rss

=== Acegiak ===
{{acegiak}} consumes podcasts through her reader [[Whisperfollow]] which aggregates RSS and, if they are marked up with podcast media tags, embeds the media for consumption and provides a link to save or open in another window

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has published a podcast on http://latenighttoast.com using [[ProcessWire]]
* First 2015-05-07: http://latenighttoast.com/episodes/001-episode-305/
* Includes [[h-feed]] microformats
* Generating the RSS feed [http://latenighttoast.com/xml-feed/] on the same domain so that we can control the canonical URL of the feed after submitting it to iTunes.
* Using [[archive.org]] to host the MP3s.
* Using URLs on the same domain that redirect to the archive.org MP3s, again so that we control the canonical URL of the MP3. This also gives us the ability to roughly track the number of streams/downloads of each episode.

== Other Examples ==

=== Microcasts ===
For additional examples of short podcasts, see the [[microcast]] page.
{{main|microcast}}

=== Wavelist ===
[[Wavelist]] is a collection of podcast episodes curated into playlists by individuals.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
Because of the way {{chrisaldrich}} formats his [[listen]] posts (using the [[Post Kinds Plugin]]) and includes html <code>audio</code> tags marked up with <code>u-audio</code>, the feed for these posts at http://boffosocko.com/kind/listen/feed can be subscribed to like a traditional podcast. Because this feed is meant more to help other's discovery of content, he calls this non-traditional podcast a "faux-cast". More details [http://boffosocko.com/2018/03/08/podcasts-of-things-ive-listened-to-or-want-to-listen-to/ here].

=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} publishes a list of podcasts he listens to:

* https://snarfed.org/podcasts

== Silo Examples ==
=== Cast ===
* [https://tryca.st/ Cast] provides a paid service to allow you to record, edit, publish, and host your podcast.

=== Anchor.fm ===
* [[Anchor]] is a [[silo]] for [[audio]] posts and [[podcast|podcasting]].

== Distribution ==
There are number of services for distributing your podcast without having to make copies (thus different from [[POSSE]] / syndication in general).

=== Huffduffer ===
[[Huffduffer]] is a bookmarking service for podcasts and audio / music / speech in general.

To submit your podcast to Huffduffer, create an account, submit your podcast with various tags.

Users of Huffduffer can then find your podcast by tag.

=== iTunes ===
[[iTunes]] is a service and application from [[Apple]] for music, video, podcasts and other multimedia. Podcasts distributed by iTunes are made easily discoverable and subscribable in:
* MacOS "iTunes" application
* iOS "Podcasts" application

==== Submitting to iTunes for distribution ====
See: [https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html How to Submit a Podcast] at apple.com

When submitting a podcast URL to iTunes, be sure to submit a URL on a domain that you control. For example, if using [[Libsyn]] to host your podcast mp3s, don't submit the RSS URL that they provide. Instead, host a page on your domain that sends a "302 Found" temporary redirect to the Libsyn URL.

The HTTP client that Apple uses to fetch your podcast feed does not support [[SNI]] or [[Let's Encrypt]] certificates. If you don't have the ability to host an https URL on a dedicated IP address with an SSL cert from a supported CA, then you will have to give Apple a non-https URL for your podcast feed.

== Changing podcast hosting providers ==

=== Podcast URL under your control ===

If your podcast URL is on your own domain, then you can just change the 302 redirect to point to the new hosting provider.

=== Podcast URL not under your control ===
If your podcast URL is not on your own domain, then the ability to change your URL is limited by whether your current host allows you to.

Libsyn has a writeup of [http://support.libsyn.com/faqs/changing-your-feed-url-in-itunes/ how to change your feed URL]. 

Essentially the process involves setting an additional property in the feed URL.

<pre>
<itunes:new-feed-url>http://newsite.example.com/podcast.rss</itunes:new-feed-url>
</pre>

== Services ==
=== Unmung ===
{{main|unmung}}
[[unmung]] will turn podcast feeds into playable HTML5 audio with microformats markup eg [http://feed.unmung.com/feed?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.bbc.co.uk%2Fpodcasts%2Fradio4%2Fiot%2Frss.xml In Our Time]

=== Granary ===
{{main|granary}}
[[granary]] converts podcast h-feeds and h-entries to RSS with enclosures, including iTunes extension elements. It reads and writes the <code>[[duration]]</code> mf2 property. [[duration#Granary|Details.]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to podcast with h-feed ===
{{aaronpk}} publishes an h-feed for his podcast:

* https://percolator.today/
** The top-level object is an h-feed with the podcast description
** Each episode is an h-entry child of the h-feed 
** Each episode h-entry has the following properties:
*** name - the episode name
*** length - duration of the episode in seconds
*** size - the file size of the audio file "17.43mb"
*** audio - the link to the mp3 file of the episode
*** url - permalink to the episode's HTML page
*** published
*** summary - episode summary, intended to be displayed in players

{{martymcguire}} publishes a podcast with h-feed.

* https://wehavetoask.com/
** The top-level object is an h-feed. The podcast description is contained in the author property of the h-feed as an h-card:
*** url
*** name - name of the podcast
*** note - summary description, similar to what appears in a podcast directory
*** photo - poster image similar to what appears in a podcast directory
** Each episode is an h-entry child of the feed, with the following properties:
*** name - title of the episode
*** summary - episode summary, intended to be displayed in players
*** audio - the link to the mp3 file of the episode
*** content - HTML with the summary text and <audio> element
*** url - permalink to the episode's HTML page
*** published

{{gRegor}} publishes a podcast with h-feed:

* http://latenighttoast.com/
** The top-level object is an h-feed with properties
*** name
*** url
*** author - nested h-card
*** summary - podcast summary, similar to what appears in podcast directory
*** photo - poster image similar to what appears in a podcast directory
** Each episode is an h-entry child of the h-feed 
** Each episode h-entry has the following properties:
*** name - the episode name
*** length - duration of the episode, e.g. "PT1H7M59S"
*** size - the file size of the audio file "62.2 MB"
*** audio - the link to the mp3 file of the episode
*** url - permalink to the episode's HTML page
*** dt-published
*** summary - episode summary, intended to be displayed in players
*** content - HTML contents of episode page. Includes summary + <audio> + length + download link. May be redundant, but may also serve as a fallback for readers that don't have special handling for [[audio]] posts

=== How to create a subscribe link ===
It is important to make it easy for people to subscribe to your podcast. {{adactio}} uses the following code, as of before 2018-04-23, to allow people to easily subscribe to [[Huffduffer]] feeds:

<pre><ul>
  <li><a rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/adactio/rss">RSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="pcast://huffduffer.com/adactio/rss">Subscribe in Podcasts app</a></li>
  <li><a href="overcast://huffduffer.com/adactio/rss">Subscribe in Overcast</a></li>
  <li><a href="downcast://huffduffer.com/adactio/rss">Subscribe in Downcast</a></li>
  <li><a href="instacast://huffduffer.com/adactio/rss">Subscribe in Instacast</a></li>
  <li><a href="podcast://huffduffer.com/adactio/rss">Subscribe in another app</a></li>
</ul></pre>

This list is very iOS centric, but the “Subscribe in Podcasts app” (with the <code>pcast</code> scheme) also works for some Android applications:

* [[Pocket Casts]] (verified by {{martijnvdven}}, 2018-04-23)
* [[AntennaPod]] (verified by {{chrisaldrich}}, 2018-04-23)

[[WordPress]] [https://codex.wordpress.org/Podcasting recommends] the <code>itpc</code> scheme “to make life easier for iTunes users”. They make no mention of which [[podcatcher]] may support it.

** "So apparently what happened is that Acast didn’t set up a 301 redirect, they setup 302 redirect. Which doesn’t tell any of the apps like Apple that the feed is permanently moved. Then they deleted my feed since I was no longer with them and they thought it was old and no longer in use. That means that anybody who subscribed to the Acast feed got bumped from the show. Which explains why I went from 80-90k downloads per episode to 30-40k. Excuse me while I go throw up." [https://xoxo.zone/@roseveleth @roseveleth] August 16, 2018
