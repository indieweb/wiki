'''<dfn>pushups</dfn>''' are an [[exercise]] [[metrics]] [[post]] type that show a number of pushups done by the user, often accompanied with an icon indicating the activity of a pushup.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses his open source HTML+CSS+JS [http://waterpigs.co.uk/pushups/ Pushups web app] (download to clone) to track (nose touch activated) and post (via [[Taproot]]'s [[micropub]] support) pushups as a [[note]] variant with inline prose hashtag "#pushups" to waterpigs.co.uk since [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SYJit/ at least 2013-10-14]. Example:
* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SYJit/
Series: https://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/?tagged=pushups

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses his open source [https://github.com/aaronpk/PushupCounter-iOS pushup-counter iOS app] to track (nose touch activated) and post (via [[p3k]]'s [[micropub]] support) pushups to aaronparecki.com (through [[p3k#Pushups]]) since [http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2013/11/28/143242/ at least 2013-11-28](or earlier?). Example:
* http://aaronparecki.com/metrics/2013/11/28/143242/
Series: https://aaronparecki.com/pushups

=== Proto-pushup examples ===
The following IndieWeb examples document pushups tracking but as a note (or other common post type) without any way of seeing all posts of that type.

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} has occasionally posted pushups tracking to tantek.com as [[notes]], e.g.:
* 2017-001: http://tantek.com/2017/001/t2/100pushupchallenge-initial-test (single set)
* 2017-041: http://tantek.com/2017/041/t1/100pushupchallenge-week-4 (multiple sets, multiple days)
No consistent structure yet, requires human interpretation.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Beeminder ===
[[Beeminder]] has a native Android app for tracking (nose touch activated) pushups and posting them to both Beeminder and your own site.
* See [[2012/Demos#Beeminder_for_the_IndieWeb|IndieWebCamp 2012 Demo]]
