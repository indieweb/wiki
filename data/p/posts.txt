A '''<dfn>post</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>posts</dfn>''' may refer to individual pieces of content published on an indieweb site such as [[notes]], [[articles]], [[responses]], or the act of creating the aforementioned content (present tense), or [[Posts about the IndieWeb]].

In list form:
* [[posts#Types_of_Posts|IndieWeb posts]], e.g. [[notes]], [[articles]], etc.
** The act of [[creating]] the aforementioned content (present tense)
*** Also used elsewhere, e.g "posts a comment", "posts a photo" 
* [[Posts about the IndieWeb]]

<!-- Having multiple posts on your own site is a requirement for [[IndieMark]] Level 1. -->
== Why ==
Why you should publish posts on your own site: see [[why]].

== How ==
How to publish a post.
* create content (write something, upload a photo, etc.)
* in HTML marked up with [[h-entry]]
* posted at a [[permalink]]
* on your [[personal domain]]

== Types of Posts ==
Experience has shown that there are different types of posts on IndieWeb sites. Publishing and display interfaces for these different types vary. Below are a few types of posts that IndieWeb community members are currently publishing.

Sometimes these types are referred to as ''post kinds'' instead. [[WordPress]] is an example of an [[CMS]] with a difference between types and kinds, where post kinds match with the IndieWeb post types. See the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] for more information.

Roughly ordered by apparent/anecdotal indieweb posting frequency across different sites / implementations (Most of these are also cross-linked from [[:Category:PostType]]):
* [[📔]] [[note]] <!-- huge number -->
* [[📄]] [[article]] <!-- lots, due to blog default post type etc. -->
* [[💬]] [[reply]] <!-- many many due to being a minor variant on note -->
<!-- remaining are roughly clustered by number of indieweb sites posting them,
as cited in each post type's IndieWeb Examples list.
This is useful for determining when to analyze examples for markup patterns 
to see if they have converged on actual markup used, consistent enough to parse.

Posts of various types may also be implicit [[mentions]] of other posts by linking to them, but the difference only matters to the receiver — i.e. there is no dedicated UI for people to publish a “mention” of something.

Indieweb community members are working on publishing these real soon now, or there exists related prior art:
* [[donation]]
* [[want]]
* ...

=== Inferring Post Type ===
It is sometimes necessary to detect what type of post a piece of content belongs to. Out of this need [[Post Type Discovery]] has been created. It outlines an algorithm where a type can be assigned to a post based on what sort of parsed properties it contains.

=== New Post Types ===
In general, we should avoid creating new post types.

Both individually and as a community. [[Simpler]] is better and all that.

The key is whenever you <em>think</em> you have something new to post, try posting it as your simplest existing post type, which are likely just [[notes]], maybe with tags, e.g. what [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]] does with steps, and [[User:Sandeep.io]] does with tags as well. Then document here on the wiki why/how that doesn't work if you run into problems.

One reason why re-using an existing post type might "not work" is that you really want to present it differently, provide a specific UX for a particular type of posts differently from any existing post type. This is the *primary* reason that should drive any desire to create new post types. 

If there's no reason to present a different UX, then you likely shouldn't be thinking about a new post type.

And even if you do want to present a different UX, consider simply using the existence of specific properties (e.g. [[in-reply-to]] for [[replies]]) to drive the presentation of a different UX, rather than creating a new post type.

If you get that far, step one, document real world examples of such new UX (even from [[silos]]) with screenshots/mockups embedded on this wiki.

After you've documented existing UX of a post type, see if you can find something similar in  [[ActivityStreams]]'s similar concept of "object types", and thus re-use their name/terminology.

== Pieces of a Post ==
At a minimum, indieweb posts should have:
* '''[[permalink]]''' URL
* '''contents''' of the post
* '''date published''' of the post
and likely:
* '''[[authorship|author]]''' of the post - even if it's self-evident from the domain.
and perhaps:
* '''avatar''' of the author of the post
All marked up with [[h-entry]]+[[h-card]] naturally.
==== Additional pieces ====
Additional information about the post:
* '''date updated'''
* '''name''' - (AKA "title") of a post ([[articles]] typically have titles)
* '''[[location]]''' - (AKA "geo") that the post was created or published from, e.g. [[tweet]] location. This can be different from the location that a post is <em>about</em>, e.g. photos of a location, [[Instagram]] locations are "locations" that the photos are of, [[Wikipedia]] uses the [[geo]] microformat on pages to indicate location information about the subject of the page, even [[checkins]] (which are usually posted at the location, but sometimes after e.g. [[postsq]]).
* '''changes''' - specifically, notable content updates since original publishing, ideally marked up with <code>&lt;ins></code> and <code>&lt;del></code> and then styled to be apparent.
* '''using''' - tool or application that was used to author / publish the post.

[[link-preview]] for the content referenced by a reply/bookmark/like/...
==== Footer sections ====
Footer sections. Posts sometimes have footers with links, references etc. Here are few known footer sections with a real-world indieweb example in the wild of each.
* More information or explanations about things in the post
** '''[[glossary|Glossary]]''' — definitions of jargon, rare, or unusual terms or phrases used in the post
** '''[[footnote|Footnotes]]''' — a mix of explanations and or citations, perhaps a superset of '''References''' below.
* Similar clusters of links to one or more posts related to the current post
** '''Previously''' - links to previous posts by the author on the same or similar subjects. E.g. [https://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]
** '''References''' - explicit list of [[citations]] supporting the post, from inline hyperlinks in the post, and/or [number] references inline in post text.
** '''Further Reading''' - links to author chosen articles that may provide additional detail or depth of information about specific topics in the post [https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/sparkbox-2020-notes] [https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/self-categorisation]
** '''[[related reading|Related Reading]]''' - typically algorithmically (though sometimes manually) chosen short list of posts usually by the same author that may be "of interest" to the reader of the current post, often more tangentially related rather than directly relevant like further posts. [https://theadhocracy.co.uk/note/what-we-talk-about-when-we-say-webmentions]
** '''[[posts-elsewhere|Elsewhere]]''' - a list of links to [[POSSE]] syndicated copies of the post on other services. E.g. [https://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]
** '''Elsewhere of this Translation''' - a list of links to [[POSSE]] syndicated copies of a post which is a translation of another post.
** '''Translations''' - links to translations of the post. E.g. [https://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]

* [[responses|Responses]] to the post
** '''[[comments]]''' - a list of comments (in time sequence order) about or replying to the post. E.g. [https://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]
** '''Referencing Articles / Mentions''' - other discussions / articles spawned as a result of (after) the post, or other related reading that cites the post. A that reader already took the time to read it and have the post in mind as context, may want to read articles that build upon it. E.g.: [https://tantek.com/2011/214/b1/osx-lion-full-screen-bug-workarounds], [https://tantek.com/2024/213/b1/choosing-tools]
** '''[[likes]]'''/favorites - primarily on [[silos]] but capturing here as something that indieweb community members have expressed an interest in implementing on their own posts [https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/books-vs-the-web]

* Automatically generated navigation by topic or time
** '''[[tags]]''' - often parsed from hashtags within the post. Examples: [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SjLvd/] [http://notizblog.org/2013/08/15/open-app-net/]
** '''[[navigation]]''' - usually previous/next links between posts. Examples: [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1000] [http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2013/10/18/1/realtimeconf] [https://tantek.com/2013/300/t1/bandwidth-exceeded-ahrefsbot-blocked-htaccess] [http://jschweinsberg.de/2013/10/16/1381893102/] [https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/gradient-borders-with-rounded-corners-on-input-fields]
* ... have a different section in the footer of your posts? Add it here with a link to a real world example.


'''Marking up these footer links.''' 
* Footer section links should be marked up with '''[[h-cite]]+[[h-card]] by default''' (see exceptions below)
* Exception: maybe "local only" comments can be just [[h-entry]]+[[h-card]], while normal comments via Webmention are mere copies of their originals and thus should be marked up with <code>h-cite</code>. See [[comments]] for details.
* Exception: some clusters of [[reactions]] also have more specific suggested markup, see their pages for guidance

==== Inline and other references ====
Some post to other post or page references are inline in a post or elsewhere but not in a separate footer per se.

== Post design ==
There's many ways to style and display posts, on their own on permalink pages, as part of a stream (e.g. a home page or [[feed]]), and in a collection in an archive.

Here are some posts about post display design:

== Differentiation in feeds? ==

'''Should post kinds be differentiated in [[RSS]] (etc.) feeds, which may of course include posts of multiple different kinds?''' As XML-based formats, both RSS and Atom would be suitable candidates for the inclusion of a namespace for the purpose of identifying the kind of an item, and this could provide valuable features to feed consumers (e.g. facilitating easy filtering). I know of course that the same functionality ought to be able to possible via parsing for relevant h- classes, but that's a heavyweight solution to what feels like it ought to be a simple problem (and isn't compatible with many existing XML manipulation tools, which are often geared towards simpler e.g. XPath parsing). I know that RSS isn't "hip", but it's not going anywhere... - {{template:danq}}
