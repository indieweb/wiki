'''<dfn>Post</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>posts</dfn>''' may refer to individual pieces of content published on an indieweb site such as [[notes]], [[articles]], & [[responses]], or the act of creating the aforementioned content (present tense), or [[Posts about the IndieWeb]].

In list form:
* [[posts#IndieWeb_posts|IndieWeb posts]], e.g. [[notes]], [[articles]], etc.
** The act of creating the aforementioned content (present tense)
*** Also used elsewhere, e.g "posts a comment", "posts a photo" 
* [[Posts about the IndieWeb]]

Having multiple posts on your own site is a requirement for [[IndieMark]] Level 1.

== Why ==
Why you should publish posts on your own site: see [[why]].

== How ==
How to publish a post.
* create content (write something, upload a photo, etc.)
* in HTML marked up with [[h-entry]]
* posted at a [[permalink]]
* on your [[personal domain]]

== Types of Posts ==
Experience has shown that there are different types of posts on IndieWeb sites. Publishing and display interfaces for these different types vary. Below are a few types of posts that IndieWeb community members are currently publishing.

Sometimes these types are referred to as ''post kinds'' instead. [[WordPress]] is an example of an [[CMS]] with a difference between types and kinds, where post kinds match with the IndieWeb post types. See the [[Post Kinds Plugin]] for more information.

Roughly ordered by apparent/anecdotal indieweb posting frequency across different sites / implementations (Most of these are also cross-linked from [[:Category:PostType]]):
* [[📔]] [[note]] <!-- huge number -->
* [[📄]] [[article]] <!-- lots, due to blog default post type etc. -->

* [[💬]] [[reply]] <!-- many many due to being a minor variant on note -->

* [[💌]] [[rsvp]] <!-- 9-13+ per 2016.indieweb.org -->

* [[📷]] [[photo]] <!-- 9 -->

* [[👍]] [[like]] <!-- 8 --> (or [[favorite]])

* [[🚩]] [[checkin]] <!-- 7 -->
* [[📅 ]] [[event]]
* [[📽️]] [[presentation]]

* [[🔖]] [[bookmark]] <!-- 6 -->
* [[♺]] [[repost]]
* [[♫]] [[jam]] 

* [[🎥]] [[video]]
* [[🎧]] [[scrobble]]

* [[⭐️]] [[review]] <!-- 5 -->

* [[📑]] [[collection]] <!-- 4 -->
* [[📍]] [[venue]]

Posts of various types may also be implicit [[mentions]] of other posts by linking to them, but the difference only matters to the receiver — i.e. there is no dedicated UI for people to publish a “mention” of something.

Indieweb community members are working on publishing these real soon now, or there exists related prior art:
* [[donation]]
* [[want]]
* ...

=== Inferring Post Type ===
It is sometimes necessary to detect what type of post a piece of content belongs to. Out of this need [[Post Type Discovery]] has been created. It outlines an algorithm where a type can be assigned to a post based on what sort of parsed properties it contains.

=== New Post Types ===
In general, we should avoid creating new post types.

Both individually and as a community. [[Simpler]] is better and all that.

The key is whenever you <em>think</em> you have something new to post, try posting it as your simplest existing post type, which are likely just [[notes]], maybe with tags, e.g. what [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]] does with steps, and [[User:Sandeep.io]] does with tags as well. Then document here on the wiki why/how that doesn't work if you run into problems.

One reason why re-using an existing post type might "not work" is that you really want to present it differently, provide a specific UX for a particular type of posts differently from any existing post type. This is the *primary* reason that should drive any desire to create new post types. 

If there's no reason to present a different UX, then you likely shouldn't be thinking about a new post type.

And even if you do want to present a different UX, consider simply using the existence of specific properties (e.g. [[in-reply-to]] for [[replies]]) to drive the presentation of a different UX, rather than creating a new post type.

If you get that far, step one, document real world examples of such new UX (even from [[silos]]) with screenshots/mockups embedded on this wiki.

After you've documented existing UX of a post type, see if you can find something similar in  [[ActivityStreams]]'s similar concept of "object types", and thus re-use their name/terminology.

== Pieces of a Post ==
At a minimum, indieweb posts should have:
* '''[[permalink]]''' URL
* '''contents''' of the post
* '''date published''' of the post
and likely:
* '''[[authorship|author]]''' of the post - even if it's self-evident from the domain.
and perhaps:
* '''avatar''' of the author of the post
All marked up with [[h-entry]]+[[h-card]] naturally.
==== Additional pieces ====
Additional information about the post:
* '''date updated'''
* '''name''' - (AKA "title") of a post ([[articles]] typically have titles)
* '''[[location]]''' - (AKA "geo") that the post was created or published from, e.g. [[tweet]] location. This can be different from the location that a post is <em>about</em>, e.g. photos of a location, [[Instagram]] locations are "locations" that the photos are of, [[Wikipedia]] uses the [[geo]] microformat on pages to indicate location information about the subject of the page, even [[checkins]] (which are usually posted at the location, but sometimes after e.g. [[postsq]]).
* '''changes''' - specifically, notable content updates since original publishing, ideally marked up with <code>&lt;ins></code> and <code>&lt;del></code> and then styled to be apparent.
* '''using''' - tool or application that was used to author / publish the post.

[[link-preview]] for the content referenced by a reply/bookmark/like/...
==== Footer sections ====
Footer sections. Posts sometimes have footers with links, references etc. Here are few known footer sections with a real world indieweb example in the wild of each.
* '''Previously''' - links to previous posts by the author on the same or similar subjects. E.g. [http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]
* '''References''' - explicit list of [[citations]] supporting the post, from inline hyperlinks in the post, and/or [number] references inline in post text.
* '''[[posts-elsewhere|Elsewhere]]''' - a list of links to [[POSSE]] syndicated copies of the post on other services. E.g. [http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]
** '''Elsewhere of this Translation''' - a list of links to [[POSSE]] syndicated copies of a post which is a translation of another post.
* '''Translations''' - links to translations of the post. E.g. [http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]
* '''[[comments]]''' - a list of comments (in time sequence order) about or replying to the post. E.g. [http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web]
* '''Referencing Articles / Mentions''' - other discussions / articles spawned as a result of (after) the post, or other related reading that cites the post. A that reader already took the time to read it and have the post in mind as context, may want to read articles that build upon it. E.g.: [http://tantek.com/2011/214/b1/osx-lion-full-screen-bug-workarounds].
* '''[[likes]]'''/favorites - primarily on [[silos]] but capturing here as something that indieweb community members have expressed an interest in implementing on their own posts
* '''[[tags]]''' - often parsed from hashtags within the post. Examples: [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SjLvd/] [http://notizblog.org/2013/08/15/open-app-net/]
* '''[[navigation]]''' - usually previous/next links between posts. Examples: [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1000] [http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2013/10/18/1/realtimeconf] [http://tantek.com/2013/300/t1/bandwidth-exceeded-ahrefsbot-blocked-htaccess] [http://jschweinsberg.de/2013/10/16/1381893102/]
* ... have a different section in the footer of your posts? Add it here with a link to a real world example.
All marked up with [[h-cite]]+[[h-card]] naturally (except maybe the comments can be just [[h-entry]]+[[h-card]]).

==== Inline and other references ====
Some post to other post or page references are inline in a post or elsewhere but not in a separate footer per se.

== Post design ==
There's many ways to style and display posts, on their own on permalink pages, as part of a stream (e.g. a home page or [[feed]]), and in a collection in an archive.

Here are some posts about post display design:
