A '''<dfn>pronoun</dfn>''' is a word that people often use to refer to other people or objects instead of their names; on the indieweb you can express which pronouns should be used to refer to you. English examples include she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/theirs.

== Why ==
Why put your pronouns in your profile? Some reasons summarized from this Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/861666628160765952
* normalize the idea of declaring pronouns
* challenge the assumption that everyone is the gender they present as
* challenge the idea that everyone is cis until proven otherwise
* remove ambiguity - people will know what to call you by

== Pronoun Badges ==
Pronoun badges are physical pins, stickers, or buttons which attendees of events can attach to their lanyards or clothing to display their pronouns. Below are some examples of pronoun pins used at various events.

=== IndieWebCamp ===
Since many conferences are normalizing explicit self-display of personal pronouns with stickers, labels pins, we provide pronoun pins at IndieWebCamps too!

* the inner black line represents the visible edge of the front of the button
* the small white letters are visible on the side of the button

Design brainstorming:

* use non-traditional or ungendered colors (see above examples)
** consider using a color palette that accommodates various forms of colorblindness. see [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html The viridis color palettes] for an example of deriving an accessible color palette.
*** decided to not prioritize this over other factors like using our brand colors, since the information conveyed by the color is also conveyed via other prominent methods (text, shape/size of shadow)
* print "indieweb.org/pronoun" in small print curved along the border (readable at in-person conversational distance) to provide a reference to find out more about where the pin came from
* around the rim of the button, include links to the code of conduct, list of events, etc

Button text:
* Pronouns
** he | him
** she | her
** they | them
** ask me!

[[File:xoxo-2018-pronoun-pins.jpg|300px]]

Pin text:
* "I use _____ pronouns"
** he / him
** she / her 
** they / their
* Please ask me my pronouns

The lack of distinguishing shapes or colors and the curly text caused these pronouns to get some negative feedback from attendees that it was difficult to read peoples' pronoun pins.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Markup ===
Several ways to mark-up pronouns are discussed on [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card-brainstorming#Pronouns Microformats.org’s h-card Brainstorming: Pronouns]
* {{martijnvdven}} has [http://wiki.zegnat.net/microformats/pronoun written about <code>u-pronoun</code>] on his own domain.

See and contribute pronoun markup research and brainstorming to:
* http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card-brainstorming#Pronouns

== FAQ ==
=== Why not preferred pronoun ===
The reason we don't use "preferred gender pronoun" is because that [http://mashable.com/2015/10/18/transgender-ally-words/ can imply] that the pronoun isn't their true pronoun.

Follow-up: Would "personal pronoun" be acceptable? As there is an implied "personal choice" aspect in that people are being offered physical pins/stickers for pronouns from which to choose from (sometimes write-in their own).
