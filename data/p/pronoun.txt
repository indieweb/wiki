A '''<dfn>pronoun</dfn>''' is a word that people often use to refer to other people or objects instead of their names; on the indieweb you can express which pronouns should be used to refer to you. English examples include she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/theirs.

== Why ==
Why put your pronouns in your profile? Some reasons summarized from this Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/861666628160765952
* normalize the idea of declaring pronouns
* challenge the assumption that everyone is the gender they present as
* challenge the idea that everyone is cis until proven otherwise
* remove ambiguity - people will know what to call you by

== FAQ ==
=== Why not preferred pronoun ===
The reason we don't use "preferred gender pronoun" is because that [http://mashable.com/2015/10/18/transgender-ally-words/ can imply] that the pronoun isn't their true pronoun.
