A '''<dfn>pronoun</dfn>''' is a word that people often use to refer to other people or objects instead of their names; on the indieweb you can express which pronouns should be used to refer to you. English examples include she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/theirs.

== Why ==
Why put your pronouns in your profile? Some reasons summarized from this Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/861666628160765952
* normalize the idea of declaring pronouns
* challenge the assumption that everyone is the gender they present as
* challenge the idea that everyone is cis until proven otherwise
* remove ambiguity - people will know what to call you by

== Pronoun Badges ==
Pronoun badges are physical pins, stickers, or buttons which attendees of events can attach to their lanyards or clothing to display their pronouns. Below are some examples of pronoun pins used at various events.

=== Donut.js ===
[[Donut.js]] has provided pronoun stickers for the meetups.

* "my pronoun:"
** "he"
** "she"
** "they"
** "ask me"


=== pronounribbons.org ===
[[File:pronounribbons.org.png|link=http://www.pronounribbons.org/|240px]]

There is deliberately no blank write-in option due to the risk of it [https://twitter.com/ctrlaltjustine/status/781955367240687616 being misused].

== Brainstorming ==
=== Markup ===
Several ways to mark-up pronouns are discussed on [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card-brainstorming#Pronouns Microformats.org’s h-card Brainstorming: Pronouns]
* {{martijnvdven}} has [http://wiki.zegnat.net/microformats/pronoun written about <code>u-pronoun</code>] on his own domain.

See and contribute pronoun markup research and brainstorming to:

=== IndieWebCamp pronouns pins ===
Since many conferences are normalizing explicit self-display of personal pronouns with stickers, labels pins, might be good to provide pronoun pins at IndieWebCamps too!

Some ideas:
* use non-traditional or ungendered colors (see above examples)
* print "indieweb.org/pronoun" in small print curved along the border (readable at in-person conversational distance) to provide a reference to find out more about where the pin came from
* ...

== FAQ ==
=== Why not preferred pronoun ===
The reason we don't use "preferred gender pronoun" is because that [http://mashable.com/2015/10/18/transgender-ally-words/ can imply] that the pronoun isn't their true pronoun.
