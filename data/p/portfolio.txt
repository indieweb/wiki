A '''<dfn>portfolio</dfn>''' on the Indieweb is a professional web page (or collection thereof) targeted at paying customers/clients that often shows examples of work and projects.

== Why ==
You should put a portfolio on your site so people looking to hire you can see examples of your work. They can also serve as an [[archival copy]] of your past work on your site. 

== How ==
How to put (and markup) a portfolio on your site - there are many ways to do so - look for examples of others’ work and see what feels right to you.
