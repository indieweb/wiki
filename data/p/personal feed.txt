A '''<dfn>personal feed</dfn>''' is a [[feed]] of your posts and may refer to typical IndieWeb [[homepage]]s (sometimes separate pages) which have a stream of posts, also called a <dfn>profile feed</dfn> on [[silo]]s, and in developer or older blogging contexts, may refer to a separate [[feed file]] of your posts.

* 2022-10-05 [https://www.searchenginejournal.com/instagram-is-now-putting-ads-in-your-profile-feed/466983/  Instagram Is Now Putting Ads In Your Profile Feed ] <blockquote>The profile feed refers to the vertical scrolling experience activated once someone taps a thumbnail on a user’s profile. It doesn’t refer to the profile grid, which will remain free from advertising.</blockquote> Note defining use of '''profile feed''' as a "vertical scrolling experience" of the complete/full posts shown when someone taps on a thumbnail on a user's profile, thus posts from that user (in contrast to a [[news feed]] or [[home feed]]).
