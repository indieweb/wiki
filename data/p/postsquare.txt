{{stub}}

'''<dfn>postsquare</dfn>''' (or <dfn><abbr>postsq</abbr></dfn>) is a portmanteau of "post" (meaning after) and "[[Foursquare]]" (the checkin service) meaning a [[checkin]] post made after the fact, that is, after the person posting it was actually at the [[location]], or perhaps after they arrived at the location.

This type of functionality may be useful for [[privacy]] reasons or even to evade stalkers.
