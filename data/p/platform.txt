A '''<dfn>platform</dfn>''' in the context of software/services is a collection of related [[API]]s/[[protocols]]/[[formats]] that can be used to build sites/[[app]]s, and sometimes misleadingly used to refer to apps themselves, or suites of apps, to [[bulshytt|exaggerate]] their sense of importance, value, or impact.

== OS Examples ==
Operating systems are platforms.
* [[iOS]]
* [[MacOS]]
* [[Android]]
* ...

== Not platforms ==
[[apps]] are not platforms. Sometimes suites of apps are called a "platform" to exaggerate their sense of importance or as a form of superlative marketing/consultant-speak, when really they're just tools. E.g.

===Online meeting platforms===
Online meeting "platforms" are not platforms, they are just a certain kind of [[app]], or sometimes suites of [[apps]] that themselves often run on different platforms.
