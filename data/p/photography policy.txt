A '''<dfn>photography policy</dfn>''' or <dfn>recording policy</dfn> is an event policy to make it clear when photographing/recording is acceptable, and how attendees can communicate their preferences; [[IndieWebCamp]]s are often livestreamed, and have photographers or organizers who take both informal session photos and group photos that are often published publicly.

== Past IndieWebCamps ==
At [[2018/Berlin]], attendees could draw a <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> border on their name tag, to express that they did not want to be photographed. At [[2019/Berlin]], the convention for a <span style="background:yellow;padding:1px 3px">yellow</span> border for 'please ask' was added. For [[2019/Utrecht]], an explicit <span style="background:green;color:white;padding:1px 3px">green</span> border was proposed for explicit permission.
