A '''<dfn>photography policy</dfn>''' or <dfn>recording policy</dfn> is an event policy to make it clear when photographing/recording is acceptable, and how attendees can communicate their preferences; [[IndieWebCamp]]s are often livestreamed, and have photographers or organizers who take both informal session photos and group photos that are often published publicly.
