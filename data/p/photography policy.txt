A '''<dfn>photography policy</dfn>''' or <dfn>recording policy</dfn> is an event policy to make it clear when photographing/recording is acceptable, and how attendees can make their preferences known.

For [[IndieWebCamp]] events, this may be a concern due to the event's livestream, group photos, and session photos.
