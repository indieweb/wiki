A '''<dfn>photography policy</dfn>''' or <dfn>recording policy</dfn> is an event policy to make it clear when photographing/recording is acceptable, and how attendees can communicate their preferences; [[IndieWebCamp]]s are often livestreamed, and have photographers or organizers who take both informal session photos and group photos that are often published publicly.

== Past IndieWebCamps ==
=== 2019 ===
* [[2019|IndieWeb Summit 2019]] had <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> lanyards to indicate no photos, and <span style="background:yellow;padding:1px 3px">yellow</span> lanyards to indicate please ask first. Default lanyards were black, and organizers wore <span style="background:lavender">lavender</span> lanyards.

* At [[2019/Berlin]] & [[2019/Düsseldorf]], round stickers were introduced for people to put on their name badges. There were <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> stickers to signify the preference not to be photographed, and <span style="background:yellow;padding:1px 3px">yellow</span> stickers to communicate an “ask first” policy.

=== 2018 ===
* At [[2018/Berlin]], attendees could draw a <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> border on their name tag, to express that they did not want to be photographed.

== Examples ==
Photo policy examples:
=== Mozilla All Hands ===
[https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco2018#Photos Mozilla All Hands] (2018 in San Francisco, as recently as 2019 in Whistler Canada)
* <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> lanyard = no photos
* otherwise ok to take photos, encouraged to add to Flickr group
=== XOXO 2018 ===
[https://2018.xoxofest.com/inclusion#photo-consent XOXO 2018 Photo Consent]
* <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> lanyard = no photos or video
* <span style="background:yellow;padding:1px 3px">yellow</span> lanyard = photos and video allowed with explicit permission (must ask)
* black [default] lanyard = photos and video allowed without permission
=== Open Source Bridge ===
[http://opensourcebridge.org/about/recording-policy/ Open Source Bridge Recording Policy]
* speakers consent to being recorded in audio and possibly audio (may NOT opt out of recording)
* registering = consent to be photographed by official conference staff, photos CC published, possibly used in promo
* only staff permitted to record talks
* participants must abide by color lanyards:
** blue [default] lanyard = ok to record or photograph
** <span style="background:yellow;padding:1px 3px">yellow</span> = ask for explicit permission prior to
** <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> = do not record or photograph
* when one person being recorded/photographed says “stop” or “leave me alone” (etc), "the interaction must end", and "attendees should not attempt to photograph that individual again" [apparently overrides lanyard color]
* photo/recording must not be done to hide from the subject being captured (e.g. no wearing [[Google Glass]] during conf)
* subjects may inspect photo/recordings of themselves any time and any request to delete must be honored immediately

=== IDEAL 2019 ===
* <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span>: No photos, please
* <span style="background:yellow;padding:1px 3px">yellow</span>: Ask to take photos of me
* <span style="background:green;color:white;padding:1px 3px">green</span>: I’m ok to be photographed

'''Criticism:''' green vs red is too similar for some colorblindness'''

** "This is neat. But I am colorblind and the red and green are a little close and I can only tell the difference comparatively. <br><br>Perhaps a pattern as well would be a good addition. Idk. I always feel weird asking for special stuff." [https://twitter.com/JenDurbent @JenDurbent] August 10, 2019

'''Recommendation: avoid green''' when using red, stick with simple black or white for default ok to be photographed.

== Brainstorming ==
* Need to update this per discussions/conclusions at '''[[2019/Organizers]]'''
* Should we '''expand this to "recording policy"''' to include video and/or audio?
** +1 {{t}} be more explicit and cover more
** +1 {{sknebel}}
** ? {{addyourself}}
* Should we provide guidance to organizers to '''prefer archiving sessions to the Internet Archive''' instead of [[YouTube]] (for many reasons, the context in which videos are shown, the videos that YouTube recommends for viewing next that are often offtopic, inflammatory, conspiracy theories and such).
** +1 {{t}} per request at [[2019/Düsseldorf]] to not be archived on YouTube
** {{sknebel}} can we delete/edit the same on archive.org (given they're generally all about not deleting things?)?
** ? {{addyourself}}
* Should this '''include "live streaming"''' or should that be separate? anecdotally some folks find a live stream more ok/safer than archived video recordings
** +1 {{t}} (proposed)
** ? {{addyourself}}
* Should we provide guidance to organizers to '''prefer live stream on Twitch.tv/indieweb''' instead of YouTube
** +1 {{t}} similar to archives, twitch.tv seems less harmful YouTube as a service for streaming
** {{rose}} This can cause issues for people on low bandwidth connections, unless we pay Twitch they get what we stream. 
** ? {{addyourself}}
* explicit <span style="background:green;color:white;padding:1px 3px">green</span> border proposed for explicit permission (context: for [[2019/Utrecht]], proposed [https://chat.indieweb.org/2019-05-04#t1556955919343600 in chat] by co-organizer Frank)
** -1 {{t}} I'd lean against this, because:
*** '''adds complexity without benefit''', i.e. what does no (lack of) sticker mean then? same as yellow? then why have yellow? then we're back to two stickers, and noticing green vs. none is harder than noticing yellow vs. none
*** '''bad for accessibility''', using green in addition to red is hard to distinguish for some colorblindness
*** more important: violates common conference conventions and expectations of default photos ok, see examples of Mozilla, XOXO, and OSBridge above (all of which have fairly strong/progressive Codes Of Conduct and Photo Policies themselves)
*** alternatively, get green lanyards for people to wear by default
** {{sknebel}} given our history/way how events work default-yes is probably fine (even though I disagree with some of the reasons given above). Lanyard colors solve this neatly in that people pick one of three options.
