A '''<dfn>photography policy</dfn>''' or <dfn>recording policy</dfn> is an event policy to make it clear when photographing/recording is acceptable, and how attendees can communicate their preferences; [[IndieWebCamp]]s are often livestreamed, and have photographers or organizers who take both informal session photos and group photos that are often published publicly.

== Past IndieWebCamps ==
* At [[2018/Berlin]], attendees could draw a <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> border on their name tag, to express that they did not want to be photographed.
* At [[2019/Berlin]], round stickers were introduced for people to put on their name badges. There were <span style="background:red;color:white;padding:1px 3px">red</span> stickers to signify the preference not to be photographed, and <span style="background:yellow;padding:1px 3px">yellow</span> stickers to communicate an “ask first” policy.

== Examples ==
Photo policy examples:
* [https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco2018#Photos Mozilla All Hands] (as recently as 2018 in San Francisco)
** red lanyard = no photos
** otherwise ok to take photos, encouraged to add to Flickr group
* [https://2018.xoxofest.com/inclusion#photo-consent XOXO 2018 Photo Consent]
** red lanyard = no photos or video
** yellow lanyard = photos and video allowed with explicit permission (must ask)
** black [default] lanyard = photos and video allowed without permission
* [http://opensourcebridge.org/about/recording-policy/ Open Source Bridge Recording Policy]
** speakers consent to being recorded in audio and possibly audio (may NOT opt out of recording)
** registering = consent to be photographed by official conference staff, photos CC published, possibly used in promo
** only staff permitted to record talks
** participants must abide by color lanyards:
*** blue [default] lanyard = ok to record or photograph
*** yellow = ask for explicit permission prior to
*** red = do not record or photograph
** when one person being recorded/photographed says “stop” or “leave me alone” (etc), "the interaction must end", and "attendees should not attempt to photograph that individual again" [apparently overrides lanyard color]
** photo/recording must not be done to hide from the subject being captured (e.g. no wearing [[Google Glass]] during conf)
** subjects may inspect photo/recordings of themselves any time and any request to delete must be honored immediately

== Brainstorming ==
* explicit <span style="background:green;color:white;padding:1px 3px">green</span> border proposed for explicit permission (context: for [[2019/Utrecht]], proposed by co-organizer Frank(?))
** -0 {{t}} I'd lean against this, because:
*** it adds complexity without benefit, i.e. what does no (lack of) sticker mean then? same as yellow? then why have yellow? then we're back to two stickers, and noticing green vs. none is harder than noticing yellow vs. none
*** more important: violates common conference conventions and expectations of default photos ok, see examples of Mozilla, XOXO, and OSBridge above (all of which have fairly strong/progressive Codes Of Conduct and Photo Policies themselves)
*** alternatively, get green lanyards for people to wear by default
