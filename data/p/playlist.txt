A '''<dfn>playlist</dfn>''' represents a collection of [[audio]] or [[video]] of some significance to the list's creator. These could then be syndicated to places like Spotify and Google Play All Access, as they tend to share a lot, if not most, of the same content.

The playlist differs from a [[jam]] or [[scrobble]] in that it acts as a sort of bookmark for a collection of media. As opposed to jams and srobbles which are passive types.
