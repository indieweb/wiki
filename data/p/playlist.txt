A '''<dfn>playlist</dfn>''' represents a collection of [[audio]] or [[video]] of some significance to the list's creator. These could then be syndicated to places like Spotify and Google Play All Access, as they tend to share a lot, if not most, of the same content.

The playlist differs from a [[jam]] or [[scrobble]] in that it acts as a sort of bookmark for a collection of media. As opposed to jams and scrobbles which are passive types.

** marked up as an h-feed with each year's playlist as an h-entry, and each song listed as h-cite with p-name as the track title and p-author as the track artist
** playlists were exported from Spotify -- instructions: https://tracydurnell.com/2022/12/07/how-i-re-created-my-spotify-playlists-on-my-website/

=== Joe Crawford ===
{{artlung}} created a page with the slug [https://artlung.com/mixtapes mixtapes] which lists the playlists he creates each year. 
* He's using h-feed, h-entry and is following the convention of p-cite as a playlist item and p-name to represent song title and p-author. 
* Also using syndication to indicate the playlists also exist on [[Spotify]]
* He's curious to know whether there's a standard format to share playlists '''without''' media files ''(xspf seems like the standard to share playlists which include media such as mp3)''
** Goal of playlist files would be to make it straightforward to migrate playlists to a new music service, or compose music video playlist
* Also curious about other data integrations: musicbrainz? Wikipedia? Lyrics providers?
* And is a playlist a sort of [[jam]]?
* Joe also has playlists from 2010 which include liner notes [https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/mefiswap/ smorgasborg.artlung.com/mefiswap/] &[https://smorgasborg.artlung.com/mefiswap2/ smorgasborg.artlung.com/mefiswap2/]
