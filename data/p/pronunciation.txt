=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{Zegnat}} has an [[h-card]] which [https://vanderven.se/martijn/ includes a visual written IPA version of his name's pronunciation as well as a link to an audio file to hear it spoken].

=== Jason McIntosh ===
{{jmac}} [http://jmac.org did exactly what {{Zegnat}} did], marking the sound-file link as a [[u-sound]] property of his [[h-card]]. This came out of a discussion in the #indieweb chat where all present agreed that a phonetic spelling wasn't globally useful (since phonetic spellings are still language-dependent), but few people can sight-read IPA. Jason thought that an IPA rendering that was conspicuously hyperlinked to a sound file made for a suitable compromise.

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has a built-in pronunciation functionality to help users indicate how their name is pronounced. It can be found in the About tab >> Details About You >> section entitled "Name Pronunciation". Their UI suggests several common pronunciations based on one's name as well as the ability to craft one's own version. They then also provide a "play" button which gives a robot produced pronunciation of the name thus specified.
