==== A Challenge for 2018! ====

Add an audio file of your preferred pronunciation of your name to your homepage [[h-card]] and add yourself to the list below. If you do, {{martymcguire}} will give you a shout-out on [[TWITIWAE|This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition]]!

=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{Zegnat}} has an [[h-card]] which [https://vanderven.se/martijn/ includes a visual written IPA version of his name's pronunciation as well as a link to an audio file to hear it spoken].

=== Jason McIntosh ===
{{jmac}} [http://jmac.org did exactly what {{Zegnat}} did], marking the sound-file link as a [[u-sound]] property of his [[h-card]]. This came out of a discussion in the #indieweb chat where all present agreed that a phonetic spelling wasn't globally useful (since phonetic spellings are still language-dependent), but few people can sight-read IPA. Jason thought that an IPA rendering that was conspicuously hyperlinked to a sound file made for a suitable compromise.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} added written IPA to https://gregorlove.com/about/#pronunciation for the most common pronunciation of his first and last name on 2018-06-30 . Also used Web Speech API Speech Synthesis to include audio of it and a few other ways to pronounce my first name.
* I don't know IPA, so I used https://tophonetics.com to generate it; corrections welcome.
* I used <code>p-ipa</code> microformat property, following {{martijnvdven}}

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has a built-in pronunciation functionality to help users indicate how their name is pronounced. It can be found in the About tab >> Details About You >> section entitled "Name Pronunciation". Their UI suggests several common pronunciations based on one's name as well as the ability to craft one's own version. They then also provide a "play" button which gives a robot produced pronunciation of the name thus specified.

=== LinkedIn ===
[[LinkedIn]] added the ability to upload a recording of your name to your profile.
