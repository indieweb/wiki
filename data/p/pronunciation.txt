[[Facebook]] has a built-in pronunciation functionality to help users indicate how their name is pronounced. It can be found in the About tab >> Details About You >> section entitled "Name Pronunciation". Their UI suggests several common pronunciations based on one's name as well as the ability to craft one's own version. They then also provide a "play" button which gives a robot produced pronunciation of the name thus specified.
