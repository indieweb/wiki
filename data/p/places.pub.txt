'''<dfn>[https://places.pub/ places.pub]</dfn>''' ([https://socialwebfoundation.org/2025/04/29/places-pub/ background]) is a service that converts [[OpenStreetMap]] [[place]] data into [[ActivityStreams]], which [[granary]] can convert to [[microformats2]]. This is valuable as a shared, canonical set of places to use in eg [[checkin]]s and [[h-card]]s.

== Examples ==

Here are a few example granary URLs that convert places.pub URLs to microformats2:

* Place: https://granary.io/url?input=as2&output=mf2-json&url=https://places.pub/node/588146912 (Golden Gate Park Bike & Skate)
* Search: https://granary.io/url?input=as2&output=mf2-json&url=https://places.pub/search?q=golden+gate+park
