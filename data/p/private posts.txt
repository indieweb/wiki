{{stub}}

'''<dfn>private posts</dfn>''' refer to [[posts]] or portions of posts which are [[privacy|private]] to either the author or to a limited [[audience]] chosen or previously approved by the author. Typical [[silos]] offer some form of private posts (or messaging, like email). This is a nascent area on the indieweb.

== Use Cases ==
There are numerous use case for private posts, however here we are capturing use-cases raised by active Indieweb community members that wish to [[selfdogfood]] such features on their own site.

=== Private messaging ===
==== Brainstorming ====
* [[Private-Webmention]]
* [[private-webmention-brainstorming]]
* [[private-messaging-brainstorming]]
* [[pgp#Possible_Solution | pgp messaging]]

=== Allow silo friends to see private posts ===
From Tom Morris in IRC:
<blockquote>Allowing your [[Facebook]] friends to see things where you assume they *don't* have their own domain, and thus you'd need to support some form of Facebook-authentication to verify their identities before showing them the private post(s) you'd like them to see. "Similarly [[Twitter]]" friends.</blockquote>

Need to maintain an address book to coordinate identities across various silos, and allow users alternative authentication mechanisms (I'd be inclined to include email). Posts could be shared with individual address-book entries or predefined mailing-lists. Or dynamic lists like "Facebook friends", "Twitter friends" above, or as [[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron]] [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-04/line/1399224045 suggested], all the h-cards linked to from a webpage like [[chat-names]]   --[[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 11:56, 8 May 2014 (PDT)

Tantek on [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-08/line/1399575433 IRC 2014-05-08]:
<blockquote>
interesting - I think tommorris was putting a bunch
of thought into private posts - as he wants to do exactly that (with
giving permissions to FB friends). re: address book - the minimal viable address book should
be just a list of URLs of people in storage. On top of that, cache their
full name and photo from their h-card at their URL (or retrieved by
snowflake API from their silo profile URL). everything else should be retrieved dynamically from their
personal site / profile URL. apply caching as needed. once you make your addressbook person-URL-centric, then all the permissions stuff becomes super obvious
</blockquote>

{{fluffy}} on using some ideas from [[AutoAuth]] to provide potential UX to "legacy" feed readers: [https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/5711-Access-token-grants-for-feed-readers Access token grants for feed readers]

: tl;dr summary: Use <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> headers and a new <code>&lt;link rel&gt;</code> to signal to readers/subscription engines that there's a mechanism to get a bearer token to present for the subscription, and a subscriber can configure their feed reader to send said token with the request for the feed.

=== Partial Page Privacy ===

During IndieWebCamp Online 2014, the question was raised of how to indicate that some or all of a page was not for public consumption.

The Use Case for this came during {{benthatmustbeme}}'s review of his contact page, which displays additional contacts to logged in users. The question was raised of how you would tell a logged in user that you did not want them to share contacts which were not public, as many sites, systems would automatically log in.

The proposed solution was suggested in marking up the information appropriately. Possible parameters might include
* For Eyes Only - Indicating that the information should not be distributed
* For Specified Group - Indicating some group it may be shared with
* The Absence of such markup would suggest public information

=== Public Page Upgrading ===

On IRC it was [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-15#t1442342684222 discussed 2015-09-15] about how to indicate the availability of possible private content for authenticated users on an otherwise public page.

It was suggested to respond with a "WWW-Authenticate" header, like the one used in [[private-webmention]], to indicate the upgrade possibility:

<pre>WWW-Authenticate: IndieAuth</pre>

It was also discussed that the response could include a unique URL as a rel-self to enable realtime [[Pubsubhubbub]] updates on said content.

This would enable [[block]] mechanisms based on eg. [http://microformats.org/wiki/block-list block lists] to advertise both some blocked items to public and additional ones privately to certain trusted users and to have changes propagate in realtime to all clients, such as [[Webmention]] endpoints, that might have use for such data to eg. block mentions from being shown.

It can also be used to upgrade a public [[h-feed]] with private posts when subscribing to it in a [[reader]].

=== Sharing only with approved followers ===
The ability to share posts only with approved followers (instead of publicly viewable) is a common [[silo]] feature, either as an aspect of a [[private account]], or sometimes as part of sharing to "friends only".

Such posts are sometimes also called a "follower-only post" or a "follower-only message".

=== Sharing With Fewer Friends ===
There are many times when you may want to share something, like something vulnerable, with only a few friends, a small subset of your "friends" on any particular social media or other service.

Thoughts from (unattributed) private (but not person-specific) messages of specific examples of such times, some ambiguities added:

<blockquote>Where does one go / post when one feels lost or in need of connection or understanding?</blockquote>
...
<blockquote>Where do you post when your significant other breaks up with you and you're friends with them and their friends too on every social network?</blockquote>
...
<blockquote>Where do you go for support for a problem you're having with someone else in your friend group? Especially when we're so interlinked.</blockquote>
...
<blockquote>We're so interlinked superficially. Linked yet feeling disconnected.</blockquote>
...
<blockquote>In public or even friends only posts we are compelled to put on an air of invulnerability, of strength, of bouncing back from anything for fear that if we don't we won't seem attractive to others we may be dating or want to date. Or to get a job or funded or whatever we are seeking approval for.</blockquote>

Should you even use the indieweb / web for this?

How could private posts be better than a simple group txt message where you add the people you want to share, then share?

Or are those the same thing with just different UIs?

Would it be a goal of this use-case to replace group txt messages?

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== {{kylewm}} ===

[[Red Wind]] has rudimentary support for private posts based on a simple list of the domains of people authorized to view a private post. The posts are viewable only if the [[IndieAuth]]ed user is in the audience list.

Example note from {{kylewm}}'s site:<br>[[File:kmahan-private-note-display.png|border|500px]]<p>[[Posting interface]]:<br>[[File:kmahan-private-note-edit.png|border|500px]]

=== {{aaronpk}} ===
[[p3k]] (v1) has support for private posts by specifying a list of the domains of people authorized to view a private post. To view the post, the user must identify themselves with [[IndieAuth]] by signing in to the site. After signing in, a session cookie is set which identifies the user.

[[File:p3k-private-post.png|450px]]

=== {{benthatmustbeme}} ===
[[postly]] has support for private posts as of 2015-11-30, more data forthcoming.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} added basic support for making a page private as of 2016-09-27, as part of work on [[private webmention]]
* https://gregorlove.com/2016/09/this-is-a-test-private/
** Returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized
** Returns WWW-Authenticate: Bearer header
** Returns Link: header for token endpoint, for authentication
** See [[private_webmention#gRegor_Morrill|my private webmention notes]] for more details

* [[uid]] for slug so no private information is leaked through the slug

=== Becky Stern ===
[https://beckystern.com/ Becky Stern] supports private posts on her site with an "Unlock with Patreon" login wall as of 2019-06-01. These allow her to post backers-only content for her [[Patreon]] on her personal site, rather than locking the content to patreon.com. This feature is provided by an official [https://wordpress.org/plugins/patreon-connect/ Patreon Connect] plugin for [[WordPress]].

* Example [https://beckystern.com/2019/06/01/my-worst-mistakes-at-work/ post from 2019-06-01]

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle}} supports private posts on his site as of [https://eddiehinkle.com/2019/06/16/1/ 2019-06-16].
* Posts with Protected visibility only appear if a user is authenticated, but they are unrestricted beyond that.
** Example: [https://eddiehinkle.com/2019/06/16/1/ Protected Post Example]
* Posts with Private visibility only appear if a user is authenticated AND they are in the audience list
** Example: [https://eddiehinkle.com/2019/03/10/1/ Private Post with Audience Example]
*** If you want access to the above post for testing purposes, reach out to me in chat
* Currently Eddie supports authentication with his website through IndieAuth
* Other forms of authentication Eddie is working on:
** [[AutoAuth]]
** Email Magic Link
** Twitter Login


=== {{beesbuzz.biz}} ===

[[Publ CMS|Publ]] has support for private posts as of [http://beesbuzz.biz/3922 2019-07-13], using [[Authl]] as the authentication broker. This supports both IndieWeb and silo users (via Twitter, Mastodon), as well as login-by-email.

Users can be put into hierarchical groups, and posts can have their visibility made based on groups and individuals. See [http://publ.beesbuzz.biz/manual/formats/322-Entry-files#auth entry auth] and [http://publ.beesbuzz.biz/manual/706-User-authentication#user_list user/group configuration] for more information.

Publ also now (as of [http://publ.plaidweb.site/blog/301-Publ-0-6-9 2020-08-14]) provides a mechanism for retrieving a bearer token to provide to a feed reader; this can be seen on [https://beesbuzz.biz/profile fluffy's site], although at present no known feed readers support this (but it is tested working in cURL, at least).

== Silo Examples ==
We can learn from the UI that [[silos]] use to present and edit the privacy of posts.

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] posts have varying degrees of (apparent) "privacy". [[photo]]s are a particularly interesting example, where it appears their viewability is on a spectrum. E.g. common examples: 
* public (indexable)
* public (no robots / login required)
* friends of anyone [[person-tag]]ged in the photo
* friends of the author of the photo
* subset of friends (curated whitelist) of the author of the photo
* only the author

Facebook shows the name of the group a post was shared with. This screenshot was captured by someone other than the author of the post.
[[File:fb-private-post-2015.png]]

==== Limited Audience ====
When a post is shared with a specific list of friends, a small gear icon appears beside the status. Hovering over it shows a list of names who the post is shared with:

[[File:facebook-limited-audience-hover-2016-10-19.png]]

Clicking the icon shows a popover with more information and links to the friends' profiles:

[[File:facebook-limited-audience-click-2016-10-19.png]]

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] supports private posts as a side effect of their [[private account]] support.

The posts themselves do not have a "private" or not setting per se, but rather as a whole are the same as the privacy of the account. The time of post does not matter, e.g. posts that look private when an account is private are made public when an account is switched the public and vice versa.

You must be logged into Instagram to view private posts (posts from private accounts where you've requested access and they've granted access).

If you are not logged in, when you try to view a private post (e.g. by following a hyperlink to a private post permalink) you may see (as of 2017-01-22) a confusing message like:

<blockquote style="text-align:center">'''Sorry, this page isn't available.''' <br/><br/>The link you followed may be broken, or the page may have been removed. Go back to Instagram.</blockquote>

=== Swarm ===

On [[Swarm]], people can checkin "off the grid", which shows the checkin only to the user themselves (with a lock-icon).

[[File:2017-08-20-swarm-private-off-the-grid.png]]

=== Google Plus ===
TODO: find a screenshot of Google+ posts shared publicly as well as with a circle.

=== WordPress ===
Wordpress enables password protected posts Here's [https://epeus.wordpress.com/2016/03/09/how-private-is-this/ an example] - note that it leaks the title and the URL. The password is 'indie'

=== LiveJournal / Dreamwidth ===

A classic example (and possibly the first): users are able to put their followers into specific friend groups who would have protected access to private posts. On LiveJournal this functionality was rather limited (IIRC, you could only set up one protection group unless you paid money) while on Dreamwidth all users have access to many access groups.

LiveJournal also by default provides you an access group of "friends," which included everyone you followed (the much-more-reasonable inverse of the "followers" group that Mastodon provides); Dreamwidth by default provides two groups, "friends" and "follows."<ref>[https://www.dreamwidth.org/support/faqbrowse?faqid=124 Dreamwidth's FAQ on the default group membership]</ref>

: Note that my knowledge of LJ is based on having used it not-very-much ages ago, and seeing the interface now would require accepting an objectionable terms of service update. — {{fluffy}}

== Other Examples ==

=== email, email lists ===
* private cc:/bcc: - author selected group
* private to a list server (listserv) - list maintainer selected group

== FAQ ==
* does any [[reader]] supports reading private posts?

== Brainstorming ==

Most of the current attempts at this have been trying to provide feeds that show different contents when fetched with some form of authentication. (e.g. [[server-indieauth]]). This is challenging for a number of reasons, and there haven't been many implementations at all yet. Maybe instead we could try a version of friends-only posts that works via WebSub delivery, avoiding the authenticated feed fetching problem entirely.


== Unsolved issues ==

=== Private feed for each authenticated ===

Given that there is a private [[feed]] for each authenticated user on each website: 

* How does private feed discovery work for readers?
** A "Follow me" or "subscribe" button usually only transfers the current URL to the reader, delegating the feed discovery task (which is necessary, since the feed reader might support one feed format but not the other). The reader will not be authenticated (as it does not have the same cookies or IP as the user), so it will not see the private feed.
* Does [[PuSH]] work with private feeds?
* Do you trust your PuSH hub enough to transmit private messages in its fat pings?

==== Feedback ====

* The first two issues might be solvable through the ideas of [[Private Posts#Public_Page_Upgrading|Public Page Upgrading]] by upgrading the normal discoverable feed to a private one after authenticating. [[User:Kodfabrik.se|Kodfabrik.se]] 11:06, 24 February 2016 (PST)

* the feed can be public without the posts in in being public. Potentially the posts can be linked from the feed, though that may leak timestamp metadata (and content in slugs if you're not careful) [[User:Kevinmarks.com|Kevinmarks.com]] 11:10, 24 February 2016 (PST)

* https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-02-18#t1455816804068000

* There are also plenty of ways in which the feed URL might be inadvertently shared with others; for example, readers which provide Atom sharing feeds will echo the originating feed's URL in the item, including for public items. So a privileged reader sharing a public item will still expose their private feed URL. This is why I abandoned the idea of per-user feeds in my own work.

=== Static Websites ===

This requires a bit of thinking to see how we can make this possible with statically generated content (conversations in https://etherpad.indieweb.org/privateposts)

Could be done client-side? Could be done with long URLs that aren't easy to guess/discover (https://indieweb.org/unlisted)?

{{jamietanna}} has documented some options and a solution he is planning on building, in https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/08/26/static-site-private-posts/

=== Other issues ===

* When sending a private message, I don't want to write my contact's domain names but select the target contacts from a list. How can [[Micropub]] clients get a list of all contacts and contact groups?
