'''<dfn>paper website</dfn>''' is a website that has been written on paper and transcribed to a web page or a printed version of a website.

== Why ==

Tools matter when you are writing. If you work better when writing on paper than you do when you are behind a screen, you could use the paper website approach to turn your written words into a blog post.

== How ==

Paper website tools use [[Optical Character Recognition]] to turn the letters on a page into a final post. This process may involve other tools such as a spelling correction algorithm to pick up and address any mistakes that may have been made during the character recognition process.

=== Tools ===
