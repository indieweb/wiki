The '''<dfn>[[p3k]] naming convention</dfn>''' is to find steampunk-era names that somewhat reflect the functionality of each microservice.

== Components of p3k ==
{{main|p3k#Apps}}
Existing names: [[Quill]], [[Teacup]], [[Switchboard]], [[Atlas]], [[Compass]], [[Telegraph]], [[XRay]], [[Monocle]] (offline), [[Percolator]], [[Overland]], [[Gramophone]], [[Watchtower]]

== Unused Names ==
