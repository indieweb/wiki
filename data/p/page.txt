'''<dfn>page</dfn>''' is short for web page on the IndieWeb, and is usually primarily known by its name and kept updated in place in contrast to [[posts]] which are primarily datetime-based; a page that is browser-editable with viewable revisions is a [[wiki-page]].

== Why ==
Itâ€™s useful to have easy to remember page names on your personal site for communicating a URL verbally, e.g. in person, for various use-cases like:
* [[contact]]
* [[pay]]
* [[tip]]
See those pages for specific IndieWeb Examples of each.

== How to ==
=== How to mark-up ===
Mark up pages with [[h-entry]] (like body class=h-entry) for [[link-preview]] purposes unless the page serves a more specific purpose like a [[homepage]] or an [[event]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle}} creates pages on his site, the exact same way he creates other posts, except he adds a slug micropub property. Eddie's regular posts are based on date and post type ([[PTD]]) so a normal post does not need or use a slug. So if a slug exists, then the post is known to be a page rather than a post, the slug is set to the top level (ex: eddiehinkle.com/slug) and stored in a separate directory from regular date-based posts.

== Chris Aldrich ==
{{chrisaldrich}} has a variety of relatively static (or relatively infrequently updated) pages on his [[WordPress]]-based website which are generally linked from one or more [[menu]]s with a parent/child hierarchy. They ostensibly have the same data as other posts or [[articles]], but they typically do not display a date or author. Example pages on his site include: [[now]], [[following]], [[followers]], [[mentions]], [[supporting]], [[bucketlist]], and [[colophon]]. Some pages are [[collections]] (eg: IndieWeb Collection) or [[portfolio]]-like (eg: [[presentation]]s).

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
{{main|Facebook Page}}
