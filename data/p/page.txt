'''<dfn>page</dfn>''' is short for webpage on the IndieWeb, and can by default be marked up with [[h-entry]] (like body class=h-entry) for [[link-preview]] purposes unless the page serves a more specific purpose like a [[homepage]] or an [[event]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle}} creates pages on his site, the exact same way he creates other posts, except he adds a slug micropub property. Eddie's regular posts are based on date and post type ([[PTD]]) so a normal post does not need or use a slug. So if a slug exists, then the post is known to be a page rather than a post, the slug is set to the top level (ex: eddiehinkle.com/slug) and stored in a separate directory from regular date-based posts.
