'''<dfn>page</dfn>''' is short for a web page on the IndieWeb, and is usually primarily known by its name (AKA <dfn>named page</dfn>), served at the top level of a site (AKA <dfn>slash page</dfn>), and kept updated in place in contrast to [[posts]] which are primarily datetime-based; a page that is browser-editable with viewable revisions is a [[wiki-page]].

== Why ==
It’s useful to have easy to remember page names on your personal site for communicating a URL verbally, e.g. in person, for various eponymous use-cases.

== Examples ==
Named pages in use by multiple community members, alphabetically listed:
* [[about]]
* [[appearances]]
* [[chipotle]]
* [[coffee]]
* [[colophon]]
* [[contact]]
* [[ideas]]
* [[links]]
* [[now]]
* [[pay]]
* [[starbucks]]
* [[tea]]
* [[tip]]
See those pages for specific IndieWeb Examples of each.

== Differences from well-known ==
Note that these are all emergent from IndieWeb publishing behaviors, in contrast to ''prescriptive'' URLs like [[well-known]] paths.

In addition, such common root level pages as listed above would likely be translated for the author’s preferred / first language, e.g.
* if you have a German site, perhaps you'd have a /jetzt page instead of a /now page

== Differences from Posts ==
Pages have some differences from other posts such as [[article]]s, [[note]]s, [[photo]]s, etc. However these differences are not yet well described. Some candidates:

* Whether a published date is displayed on the page (whereas typically articles display the published date)
* The URL of the page (typically pages will have URLs without date components, whereas other posts usually contain some date components in the URL like year, month, day)
* Whether the entry is contained within feeds (pages typically are not added to the list of blog posts, and appear only in navigation or not at all, e.g. are unlisted) 

== How to ==
=== How to mark-up ===
Mark up pages with [[h-entry]] (like body class=h-entry) for [[link-preview]] purposes unless the page serves a more specific purpose like a [[homepage]] or an [[event]].

Note: The definition of [[h-entry]] suggests that it is used for "episodic or datestamped content", so it may not be suitable for a "page" if that page is not episodic or datestamped.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle}} creates pages on his site, the exact same way he creates other posts, except he adds a slug micropub property. Eddie's regular posts are based on date and post type ([[PTD]]) so a normal post does not need or use a slug. So if a slug exists, then the post is known to be a page rather than a post, the slug is set to the top level (ex: eddiehinkle.com/slug) and stored in a separate directory from regular date-based posts.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has a variety of relatively static (or relatively infrequently updated) pages on his [[WordPress]]-based website which are generally linked from one or more [[menu]]s with a parent/child hierarchy. They ostensibly have the same data as other posts or [[articles]], but they typically do not display a date or author. Example pages on his site include: [[now]], [[following]], [[followers]], [[mentions]], [[supporting]], [[bucketlist]], and [[colophon]]. Some pages are [[collections]] (eg: IndieWeb Collection) or [[portfolio]]-like (eg: [[presentation]]s).

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has several pages on his website which exist outside of the normal flow of articles and other posts. These pages do not display a published date, are not shown in any lists of posts, and do not include any tags. They do receive and display comments like other posts.

* https://aaronparecki.com/contact/
* https://aaronparecki.com/now/
* https://aaronparecki.com/gps/
* https://aaronparecki.com/life-stack/
* https://aaronparecki.com/home-automation/
* Some pages do not use the same styling as the rest of the website: https://aaronparecki.com/profile/

=== Ton Zijlstra ===
{{tonz}} has several named pages (slashpages). They have a created and last tended to date, to show they are being actively maintained. Next to /now /about and /hello (on how to contact him), he also introduced [https://www.zylstra.org/blog/reverse-turing/ /reverse-turing] to attest in his other online material it was human created (as the default assumption must now be something is generated).

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
{{main|Facebook Page}}

=== Ghost ===
[[File:Screenshot_2020-07-25_This_Is_How_We_Do_It.png]]
[[Ghost]] represents pages devoid of episodic markup (no time information is visible or used in presentation) and removes things specific to a post (comments, reaction, etc).

== Services ==
There is also a search engine that is indexing a few of these pages:
* https://aboutideasnow.com/about — indexes /about /now /ideas

See also [[wiki-page#Brainstorming]] for existing brainstorming for pages that have wiki-like attributes.

=== nope ===
* a /nope page like https://baty.net/nope
* another /nope example: https://fyr.io/nope

=== yep ===
* also example of a /yep page: https://fyr.io/yep

=== hello ===
* /hello pages, {{citation

=== A few suggestions from {{kupietz}} ===
* '''/Instruments''' - what musical instruments you play, https://michaelkupietz.com/instruments
* '''/Toys''' - as opposed to /Uses or /Carry, which you regularly use or carry, favorite toys and stuff, even if they don't see much use. The point is, you love them when you do use them. https://michaelkupietz.com/toys
* '''/Trivia''' - Trivia about you. https://michaelkupietz.com/trivia
* '''/Favorites''' - Favorites. Movies, Music, Books. https://michaelkupietz.com/favorites
