'''A <dfn>profile photo</dfn>''' is a photo or other image typically used to identify the author of a post.

Profile photos are usually found on a person’s [[homepage]], as part of their [[profile]], as a website [[icon]], and next to their name where their name is used to identify the author of a [[post]] or [[comment]]. Profile photos are also sometimes used in [[facepile]]s.

== How ==

Profile photos identify people and should be marked up using [[h-card]]. Often they’ll be part of a large h-card containing other information, but a single img element can be used alone (or nested in an anchor) to create an h-card:

<pre>
<a class="h-card" href="https://example.com">
  <img src="/photo.jpg" alt="Author Name" />
</a>
</pre>

== IndieWeb Examples ==

Do you publish a profile photo on your site? If so, how? Add yourself here:

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] publishes a profile photo on [https://waterpigs.co.uk/ his homepage] as part of his profile h-card, as well as in the authorship h-card for every post and note ([https://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4gCFnn/ example]).

Each profile photo is dated and kept when the “main” profile photo is changed. Old posts retain the profile photo in use when they were published ([https://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4dRKs8/ example of old photo] [https://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4gCFnn/ example of new photo])

The current profile photo is also used as the site’s [[icon]].
