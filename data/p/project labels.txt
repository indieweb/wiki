<dfn>'''Project Labels'''</dfn> are a way of categorizing project issues on project management software. Specifically, focusing on the labels used for Indieweb project iteration.

While change control and expansion of Indieweb projects does vary, the common elements include:

* A series of stages culminating in stability
* The requirement for implementations/use in the wild.
* Need for feedback and review
* Need demonstrated use cases

The below is based on a version of a [https://indieweb.org/Falcon#one-off_tag-of_post list] originally created by {{t}} and modified by {{gwg}}. It shows the labels and their descriptions. As opposed to having multiple review labels, for example, the combination of labels would indicate the type of review.

* '''Review''' - Indicates a need to review some aspect of the issue
* '''Tests''' - Indicates a need for tests to demonstrate/try out
* '''Proposal''' - Indicates that the issue or problem raised needs a clear proposal or design.
* '''Implementation''' - Indicates that the issue or problem needs an implementation(s)
* '''Iteration''' - Indicating that a proposal needs update/iteration due to feedback or other considerations
* '''Aged''' - Indicating a proposal should be reviewed due no activity on it, or its age and considered for closure or iteration.
* '''Feedback''' - Indicating a proposal needs feedback
* Stages of project, for example - 
** '''Stable''' - Indicates meets criteria for stable, but requires a concurring review
** '''Draft''' - Indicates meets criteria for draft, but requires a concurring review
