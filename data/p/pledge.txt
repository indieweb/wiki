A '''<dfn>pledge</dfn>''' is a recurring [[donation]]; to pledge a regular amount to the IndieWeb community, see the IndieWeb [[Open Collective]].

== Why ==
For creators, collecting pledges helps you raise money to support your work.

For patrons, making pledges allows you to support creators on an ongoing basis.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Do you have a feature on your website for folks to sign-up to pledge a regular amount and donate it? Add yourself!
=== Drew DeVault ===
Drew DeVault has a dedicated donation page: https://drewdevault.com/donate/ which has the ability to pledge regular donations via

* [[Liberapay]]
And displays the monthly amount received via both in a graph at the bottom of the page
