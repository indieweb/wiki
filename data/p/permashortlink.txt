https://indieweb.org/permashortlink

A '''<dfn id=permashortlink>permashortlink</dfn>''' (abbreviated <dfn><abbr>PSL</abbr></dfn>) is a URL using a [[short-domain]] that expands to a [[permalink]]; on the IndieWeb, PSLs use personal short domains to expand to the same person's personal domain, thus minimizing the fragility often associated with shortlinks.

== Why ==
There are several reasons to create and maintain permashortlinks.
* '''More reliable''' in [[email]] (some mail programs truncate/break URLs >70 chars)
* '''Quicker to recall / copy due to size''' in IM, browser screenshots, print, images, etc [http://tantek.com/w/ShortURLPrintExample]
* '''Less effort to manually enter''' - The easier to read and type-in, the more folks visit the URL. 

Older reasons that apply less or not at all nowadays:

* '''Content limits on [[POSSE]] destinations''', where providing a permashortlink at the end saves space over a full permalink, thus allowing you to POSSE more of your content.

== How ==
Here is a simple way to setup permashortlinks:
* Get a personal [[short-domain]]
* Set it up to redirect to your personal [[domain]]
* Setup short path handling on your personal domain to expand and redirect to your permalinks.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Ordered roughly by when deployed.
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} uses [[Falcon]] running on tantek.com with [[algorithmic]] permashortlinks [https://twitter.com/t/status/8228455558 POSSEd since 2010-01-26]. Example:
* https://twitter.com/t/status/8228455558 POSSE copy has http://ttk.me/t43W1 at the end, which links to:
** http://tantek.com/2010/001/t1/declaring-independence-building-it

Summary description:
* <samp><nowiki>http://ttk.me/tSSSn</nowiki></samp> or
* <samp><nowiki>http://ttk.me/b/SSSn</nowiki></samp> where:
* SSS = sexagesimal epoch days - see http://tantek.com/w/NewBase60
* t = literal 't' for short <em>text</em> [[notes]], and 'b' for blog [[posts]] / [[articles]]. Both from this list: http://tantek.com/w/Whistle#design
* n = nth post of that type that day
This is sufficient to expand to:
* <samp><nowiki>http://tantek.com/YYYY/DDD/tn/</nowiki></samp> or
* <samp><nowiki>http://tantek.com/YYYY/DDD/bn/</nowiki></samp> respectively, where:
** YYYY = year
** DDD = day of the year (see related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Ordinal_dates )
** t or b  = again a literal 't' or 'b'
** n = nth post of that type that day
** and that's sufficient to retrieve the post from storage, including slug text which follows the "...n/" in the permalink URL

=== Michael Owens ===
{{mowens}} uses [[Whistler]] on https://mowens.com/ as of 2014-07-08.

Whistler is a Node.js module that implements a flexible version of the [[Whistle]] algorithm (by Tantek at http://tantek.com/w/Whistle) for shortening, expanding, and explaining links using [[NewBase60]].

Whistler and the NewBase60 Node.js modules are both available on NPM and GitHub:
* Whistler
** NPM: https://npmjs.org/package/whistler
** GitHub: https://github.com/mko/Whistler
* NewBase60
** NPM: https://npmjs.org/package/newbase60
** GitHub: https://github.com/mko/NewBase60

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} uses [[algorithmic]] permashortlinks, handled by a [[Python]] [[Flask]] application since April 2016.

Summary Description:
* Each post on Marty's site has a [[permalink]] URL (or a redirect) based on the date and time it was published. They are of the form: <samp><nowiki>https://martymcgui.re/YYYY/MM/DD/hhmmss/</nowiki></samp>.
* Permashortlinks are of the form <samp><nowiki>http://mmg.re/DDDTTT</nowiki></samp> where:
** DDD = [[NewBase60]] epoch days. This is expanded to <samp><nowiki>/YYYY/MM/DD/</nowiki></samp>
** TTT = [[NewBase60]] seconds in the day. This is expanded to <samp><nowiki>/HHMMSS/</nowiki></samp>
* Example: http://mmg.re/4xgNaa expands to: https://martymcgui.re/2018/11/26/173535/

The source code for handling the redirects is [https://git.schmarty.net/schmarty/mmgre/src/branch/master/mmgre_shorturls/__init__.py available here].

== Silo Examples ==
{{aaronpk}} 2009-12-08 I'm noticing everyone has their own URL shortener now.[https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/6474702736] E.g. [[silos]]:
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]]: flic.kr -> flickr.com 
=== Build It With Me ===
[[Build It With Me]]: bldw.me -> builditwith.me
