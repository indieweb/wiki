A '''<dfn>push notification</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>client notification</dfn>) is a [[notification]] that shows up on one or more of your client devices without explicitly requesting it; on the IndieWeb, push notifications originate from your personal site and are delivered to your personal devices using one or more services.

== Why ==
You should implement push notifications for yourself, your site so you don't have to poll your [[notifications]] page.

== Why not ==
=== Anxiety and fear ===
[[mobile]] push notifications can cause anxiety and fear:
* 2011-08-26 <cite>[http://thedailyadventuresofhannah.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/blackberry-red-light-of-doom.html Blackberry Red Light of Doom]</cite> <blockquote>Basically, whenever I see the red light flash on my Blackberry, I do '''panic''' a little bit inside and I dont know why! I get this '''strange gut feeling'''. It's not like my phone has turned evil and is trying to take over the world, it is simply telling me that I have a [[text]], [[email]], BBM, [[facebook]] notification....(could be anything really, Blackberries really can do everything)</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' and Wikilinks added.
=== Distraction ===
When attempting to focus one's attention on specific projects or goals, being deluged with unrelated notifications can be very distracting. Every notification system needs facilities to get specific notifications to be quiet, temporarily or permanently. The lack of said modes may reflect a software vendor's desire for you to engage more with their service rather than respecting your time and resources.

== How to ==
No replicable indieweb solutions to Push Notifications yet. See [[#Projects]] below for work in progress and [[#Brainstorming]] for areas to explore.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}}'s site aaronparecki.com receives [[webmentions]] and then sends them to his own IRC channel, which then sends a push notification to his phone when his IRC status is "AFK" status. The notification sends just the two URLs (source, target), and the type of webmention, e.g. [[reply]], [[like]], etc. [[mention-app]] (see Projects below) is his eventual goal.

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}}'s site martymcgui.re receives [[webmentions]] at [[webmention.io]], which is configured to send a notification to a [[webhook]] running on his site. That hook uses [[Pushbullet]] to send a push notification to his phone and other devices.

=== Jamie Tanna ===
{{jamietanna}} converts [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/01/12/webmention-notifications/ webmention interactions to push notifications], previously using Pushbullet, but now using Pushover.

Jamie has copied aaronpk's idea of the Okta Factors API for push notifications for IndieAuth logins https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/11/11/okta-factors-api-passwordless/

Jamie also plans to use a `notify` scope to allow clients to notify him, using a specific notification service (yet to be written).

=== Past Examples ===
==== Ben Roberts ====
{{benthatmustbeme}}'s site used Google Cloud Messaging service to send notifications to his phone and desktop.  This uses the new Push API still being implemented in browsers.  The notification simply links to ben.thatmustbe.me/activity but more recent versions would allow for pushing information to the notifier as well.  While mobile works, it seems to forget itself after a time (restart of phone?).

== Software Examples ==
=== Known ===
Out of the box [[Known]] supports browser push notifications (on Chrome, and possibly(?) others) for interactions with posted content (likes and comments).

== Silo Examples ==
* On [https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/instant-browser-notifications/ 8/10/16 WordPress.com] began using push notifications in Chrome & Firefox to notify blog users of likes and comment interactions on their sites. They indicated: "Browser notifications give you a real-time sense of your readers’ reactions, allowing you to stay more engaged with your audience."

== Projects ==
=== Mention app ===
{{main|mention-app}}
* {{aaronpk}} brainstormed an iOS app (for now called just [[mention-app]]) to send him push notifications from an [[h-feed]]. Thus, if a server publishes received [[webmentions]] into an h-feed page, the app will get those (hopefully via [[PuSH]], last resort via polling), and propagate them to the user's iOS device.

== Brainstorming ==
For notifications from an indieweb site to a web browser on a device, you may be able to use one or more of the following:
