A '''<dfn>push notification</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>client notification</dfn>) is a [[notification]] that shows up on one or more of your client devices without you having to explicitly request it — it's "pushed" to you, instead of you having to poll for it.

=== Why ===
You should implement push notifications for yourself, your site so you don't have to poll your [[notifications]] page.

=== How to ===
No replicable indieweb solutions to Push Notifications yet. See [[#Projects]] below for work in progress and [[#Brainstorming]] for areas to explore.

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}}'s site aaronparecki.com receives [[webmentions]] and then sends them to his own IRC channel, which then sends a push notification to his phone when his IRC status is "AFK" status. The notification sends just the two URLs (source, target), and the type of webmention, e.g. [[reply]], [[like]], etc. [[mention-app]] (see Projects below) is his eventual goal.

==== Ben Roberts ====
{{benthatmustbeme}}'s site uses Google Cloud Messaging service to send notifications to his phone and desktop.  This uses the new Push API still being implemented in browsers.  The notification simply links to ben.thatmustbe.me/activity but more recent versions would allow for pushing information to the notifier as well.  While mobile works, it seems to forget itself after a time (restart of phone?).

==== Known ====
Out of the box [[Known]] supports browser push notifications (on Chrome, and possibly(?) others) for interactions with posted content (likes and comments).

=== Silo Examples ===
* On [https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/instant-browser-notifications/ 8/10/16 WordPress.com] began using push notifications in Chrome & Firefox to notify blog users of likes and comment interactions on their sites. They indicated: "Browser notifications give you a real-time sense of your readers’ reactions, allowing you to stay more engaged with your audience."

=== Projects ===
==== Mention app ====
{{main|mention-app}}
* {{aaronpk}} brainstormed an iOS app (for now called just [[mention-app]]) to send him push notifications from an [[h-feed]]. Thus, if a server publishes received [[webmentions]] into an h-feed page, the app will get those (hopefully via [[PuSH]], last resort via polling), and propagate them to the user's iOS device.

=== Brainstorming ===
