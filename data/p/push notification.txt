https://indieweb.org/push_notification

A '''<dfn>push notification</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>client notification</dfn>) is a [[notification]] that shows up on one or more of your client devices without explicitly requesting it; on the IndieWeb, push notifications originate from your personal site and are delivered to your personal devices using one or more services.

== Why ==
Push notifications can be useful for notifications that have a timely aspect to them, such as [[direct message]]s, [[event]]s about to start, or changes to [[RSVP]]s. You should implement push notifications for your site so you don't have to poll your [[notifications]] page for such timely items.

== How to ==
No replicable indieweb solutions to Push Notifications yet. See [[#Projects]] below for work in progress and [[#Brainstorming]] for areas to explore.

=== How to turn off ===
How and why to turn off

=== How to design better ===
2016-03-25 [https://medium.com/@intercom/designing-smart-notifications-36336b9c58fb Designing smart notifications] 
* 2015-12-09 also on Intercom's blog: [https://www.intercom.com/blog/its-time-for-notifications-to-get-smart/ It’s time for notifications to get smart] <blockquote><p>My phone buzzed. I was somewhere in Iceland. More than ten miles from my car and any other human being. Holding a phone with a dying battery. I turned it on to check Google Maps.</p><p>“Spotify added 2 tracks to the playlist Afternoon Acoustic”. Perfect timing. A ping from Periscope: “@kayvon wants you to watch …”, two new emails in Mailbox, a new Twitter follower, a @channel ping on Slack. Nine notifications in total. None vaguely important when I was stuck in the wilderness with 2% battery, a volatile internet connection and a real need to load that freaking map.</p><p>Despite all of the advances of the past 20 years, notifications are still stuck in 1999.</p></blockquote>

Techniques (from the blog post)
* Smart timing — what is the best timing for a ping
* Smart location — notify you about tasks when you are at the location best suited to getting it done
* Smart grouping — a gradual grouping
* Smart reactions — based on how a user interacts with content, better wording and structure choices
* Smart targeting — focus on the right user and turn down the noise for everyone else

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}}'s site aaronparecki.com receives [[webmentions]] and then sends them to his own IRC channel, which then sends a push notification to his phone when his IRC status is "AFK" status. The notification sends just the two URLs (source, target), and the type of webmention, e.g. [[reply]], [[like]], etc. [[mention-app]] (see Projects below) is his eventual goal.

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}}'s site martymcgui.re receives [[webmentions]] at [[webmention.io]], which is configured to send a notification to a [[webhook]] running on his site. That hook uses [[Pushbullet]] to send a push notification to his phone and other devices.

=== Jamie Tanna ===
{{jamietanna}} converts [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/01/12/webmention-notifications/ webmention interactions to push notifications], previously using Pushbullet, but now using Pushover.

Jamie has copied aaronpk's idea of the Okta Factors API for push notifications for IndieAuth logins https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/11/11/okta-factors-api-passwordless/

Jamie also plans to use a `notify` scope to allow clients to notify him, using a specific notification service (yet to be written).

=== Past Examples ===
==== Ben Roberts ====
{{benthatmustbeme}}'s site used Google Cloud Messaging service to send notifications to his phone and desktop.  This uses the new Push API still being implemented in browsers.  The notification simply links to ben.thatmustbe.me/activity but more recent versions would allow for pushing information to the notifier as well.  While mobile works, it seems to forget itself after a time (restart of phone?).

== Software Examples ==
=== Known ===
Out of the box [[Known]] supports browser push notifications (on Chrome, and possibly(?) others) for interactions with posted content (likes and comments).

== Service Examples ==
=== WordPress com ===
* On [https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/instant-browser-notifications/ 8/10/16 WordPress.com] began using push notifications in Chrome & Firefox to notify blog users of likes and comment interactions on their sites. They indicated: "Browser notifications give you a real-time sense of your readers’ reactions, allowing you to stay more engaged with your audience."
=== Slack ===
* https://twitter.com/mengxilu/status/1550519453598642176 <blockquote>"Found this gem of "How Slack Decides to Send a Notification" flowchart. <br><br>This is a perfect example of "how hard could that be..."" <cite style="display:block; text-align:right">[http://kanmon.com @mengxilu] July 22, 2022</cite></blockquote> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYSM5KQUcAAzdmY.jpg" alt="A complex flow-chart for deciding how &amp; when to send push notifications" style="max-width:90%" />

== Platform Examples ==
Examples of notification user interface presentation from [[platforms]] (e.g. operating systems)

=== iOS 7 ===
This iOS 7 "recent items" notifications example shows 2-3 different kinds of notifications from two apps, a [[favorite]], several [[likes]], and a [[reply]].
<span style="float:right">[[File:2014-361-ios-recent-notifications.jpg|320px]]</span>

=== Twitter iOS app ===

<blockquote style="width:20em">'''Twitter''' 58m ago<br/>@fraying favorited:<br/>text first design is a form of <br/>universal design: listenable, more <br/>accessible. also a path to progre...</blockquote>
=== Instagram iOS app ===
<img src="https://twitter.com/instagram/profile_image" style="max-height:1.5em"/> [[Instagram]] iOS App:
<blockquote style="width:20em">'''Instagram''' 8m ago <br/>cristyle__ liked your photo.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>...<br/><br/><hr/><br/>lucianteo said: "You're burping <br/>hashtags."<br/><br/><hr/></blockquote>

=== Android ===

Note clustering is limited to grouping and showing a count, actual text of notifications is not intelligently collapsed at all, e.g. notification text repeats the account that "Favourited":

=== MacOS ===
{{section-stub}}
'''<span id="Growl">Growl</span>''' was a Mac OS X-based notification service. It has mostly been supplanted by Notification Center, which has been built into OS X since Mountain Lion's release in 2012.

(screenshots needed)

=== Analysis of design differences ===
Note the differences:
* "@username" vs. "username"
* "[[favorited]]:" vs. "[[liked]]" (no colon) vs. "said:"
* (linebreak) (unquoted 99 chars of tweet ...) vs. "your photo." vs. (inline quoted reply)

Some presentations of some notifications like these "recent items" begin to look like "[[cards]]".

== Projects ==
=== Mention app ===
{{main|mention-app}}
* {{aaronpk}} brainstormed an iOS app (for now called just [[mention-app]]) to send him push notifications from an [[h-feed]]. Thus, if a server publishes received [[webmentions]] into an h-feed page, the app will get those (hopefully via [[PuSH]], last resort via polling), and propagate them to the user's iOS device.

== Brainstorming ==
For notifications from an indieweb site to a web browser on a device, you may be able to use one or more of the following:
* http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/
* https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush
** Works on FirefoxOS devices and (presumably) the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client desktop simulator]

* if you use a mobile messenger with push support, messages sent by a bot work like a kind of push message
* [[Pushover]]
* [[Pushbullet]]
* [[Pushpad]]

== Criticism ==
=== Fatigue ===
{{main|notification fatigue}}

=== Anxiety and fear ===
[[mobile]] push notifications can cause anxiety and fear:
* 2011-08-26 <cite>[http://thedailyadventuresofhannah.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/blackberry-red-light-of-doom.html Blackberry Red Light of Doom]</cite> <blockquote>Basically, whenever I see the red light flash on my Blackberry, I do '''panic''' a little bit inside and I dont know why! I get this '''strange gut feeling'''. It's not like my phone has turned evil and is trying to take over the world, it is simply telling me that I have a [[text]], [[email]], BBM, [[facebook]] notification....(could be anything really, Blackberries really can do everything)</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' and Wikilinks added.

=== Distraction ===
When attempting to focus one's attention on specific projects or goals, being deluged with unrelated notifications can be very distracting. Every notification system needs facilities to get specific notifications to be quiet, temporarily or permanently. The lack of said modes may reflect a software vendor's desire for you to engage more with their service rather than respecting your time and resources.
