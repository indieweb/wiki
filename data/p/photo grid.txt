* [[multi-photo]]s are indicated with a little stacked icon in the top right corner
* some of the photos in the grid are from checkins, and there is no indicator of whether a post is a photo or checkin
* {{aaronpk}}: sometimes my post sorting includes a photo here that I don't want displayed in the grid, so I remove it from this page manually. (e.g. screenshots, some not so interesting photos in checkins)
