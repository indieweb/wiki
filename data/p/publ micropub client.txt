'''<dfn>[https://github.com/hreeder/publ publ]</dfn>''' is a Python [[Micropub]] client by {{tbrb}}.

Usage is split into configuring a site and posting. Posting is currently done with the following command:

<code>python publ.py post words words words words words</code>

The next goal is going to be to get it packaged and be used with:

<code>publ post words words words words words</code>

== To-Do ==
* Support for using a blocking editor rather than command line arguments, a-la git commit
* Support more post kinds (and actually specify the h value)

== See Also ==
* [[Micropub]]
* [[Publ CMS]]
