    '''<dfn>pilcrow</dfn>''' is a backwards P "used as an indent for separate paragraphs or to designate a new paragraph in one long piece of copy"([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow WP]). Trac has a feature where when you hover over a heading, it shows a pilcrow with "link to this section" hover text. For example: https://informatics.gpcnetwork.org/trac/Project
