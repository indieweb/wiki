A '''<dfn>personal cloud</dfn>''' is a software solution to administrate services, usually with a nice [[user-interface|user interface]]. The goal of personal clouds is to make it easy for an end-user to manage a server and [[deployment|deploy]] services such as [[email]], [[web hosting]] and [[XMPP]].

== Why use a personal cloud ==

Many people who are not used to administrating servers may find it easier to setup a personal cloud on a VPS or dedicated server, and from there [[deployment|deploy]] their favorite [[content management system]].

Personal Clouds are notably known for making it easy to administrate [[email]] servers.

For email, [http://www.iredmail.org/ iRedMail] offers and out-of-the-box, easy to administer solution; Zentyal (listed below) also has an easy to use mail part.

== Solutions ==

There are many projects under development that are attempting to make installing of server side software on personal clouds as easy as installing apps on a mobile device.
