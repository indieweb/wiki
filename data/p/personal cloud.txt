A '''<dfn>personal cloud</dfn>''' is a software solution to administrate various [[cloud]] services, usually with a nice [[user-interface|user interface]], on servers you personally control. 

== Why ==
The goal of personal clouds is to make it easy for an end-user to manage a server and [[deployment|deploy]] services such as [[email]], [[web hosting]] and [[XMPP]].

Many people who are not used to administrating servers may find it easier to setup a personal cloud on a VPS or dedicated server, and from there [[deployment|deploy]] their favorite [[content management system]].

Personal Clouds are notably known for making it easy to administrate [[email]] servers.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are a number of IndieWeb community members who are putting specific effort into moving away from cloud [[silos]] and rebuilding their applications on top of cloud (or even just [[web hosting]]) building blocks, from providers they can swap in and out and switching between at their desire.
