A '''<dfn>post</dfn>''' is either a piece of content or the act of publishing that content (usually in a way that is shared). It is different than a [[page]]

* A discreet piece of content (perhaps a [[note]] or an [[article]]) â€” see also [[posts]]
* The act of creating the aforementioned content
** Also used elsewhere, e.g "posted a comment", "posted a photo"

== Why ==
(this section is a stub and needs expansion)

Why post something? Excellent question, and the answer is likely to be very personal, much more so than the general [[why]] IndieWeb question (and answers).

Perhaps start with analyzing what do you already post, and where? E.g.

* Do you post on [[silo]]s?
** What kinds of things do you post on silos?
** Why do you post any one specific post on a silo?
** Is that something you could post to your own site instead? (and [[POSSE]])
** If so, try it. If not, why not?
* Do you post on public [[mailing list]]s? 
** What kinds of things do you post on mailing lists?
** Are they things you could post on your own site first? And POSSE to the mailing list with a link back to your post permalink?

== How to ==
Determine the:
* [[original-post-discovery|original URL of a post]]
* [[authorship|author of a post]]
* [[page-name-discovery|name of a page]]
* [[post-type-discovery|implied type of a post]]
And how to:
* [[comments-presentation#How_to_display|Find info to display a post as a comment]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== Thoughts on why post ===
Add more specific thoughts on '''why you (might want to) post'''.
* One of the [[100DaysOfIndieWeb#Other_100_Days_Projects|100 Days Projects]] that resonates with you
* ...

Perhaps even document thoughts on '''why you might not post''':
* Avoiding self-promotion. Some alternatives:
** post promoting others's good work instead or first
** post something for a community (like an indie [[event]] for a community meetup like [[HWC]])
* ...

=== What to post ===
Having trouble coming up with inspiration or ideas about what to post? See if any of these resonate: (or add your own when you find sources of inspiration to post)

* Anniversaries of projects or activities you started/joined and have kept up with
** publish on the day of or within a few days of the anniversary date
** provide a highlights or a brief summary of what you did on the subject in the past year
** link to previous years's post(s) on the subject
* ...
