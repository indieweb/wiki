A '''<dfn>post</dfn>''' is either a piece of content or the act of publishing that content (usually in a way that is shared). It is different than a [[page]]

* A discreet piece of content (perhaps a [[note]] or an [[article]]) — see also [[posts]]
* The act of creating the aforementioned content
** Also used elsewhere, e.g "posted a comment", "posted a photo"

== Why ==
This section is about why you should post in general. For why you should post on your own site, see:
* [[why]]

Why post something? Excellent question, and the answer is likely to be very personal, much more so than the general [[why]] IndieWeb question (and answers).

Perhaps start with analyzing what do you already post, and where? E.g.

* Do you post on [[silo]]s?
** What kinds of things do you post on silos?
** Why do you post any one specific post on a silo?
** Is that something you could post to your own site instead? (and [[POSSE]])
** If so, try it. If not, why not?
* Do you post on public [[mailing list]]s? 
** What kinds of things do you post on mailing lists?
** Are they things you could post on your own site first? And POSSE to the mailing list with a link back to your post permalink?

=== Why post ===
<span id="Thoughts_on_why_post">'''Why you (might want to) post'''</span> (or just why write). Share your reasons why you post, maybe they'll help motivate someone else!

* [https://dri.es/comment/134646#comment-134646 Dries's comment]: <blockquote><p>I write for myself first. Writing, in many ways, pushes me to think; writing is my process to flesh out ideas. </p><p>I write for the conversations second. I use this blog to think out loud in a public space, and to start conversations with people thinking about the same topics. </p></blockquote>

* [https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/ Shawn Wang: Learn In Public]: Posting as a mode of "learning in public":<blockquote><p>You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people "learn in private", and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. Again, that's fine, but we're here to talk about being in the top quintile. What you do here is to have a habit of creating learning exhaust. Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets. [...] Don't judge your results by "claps" or retweets or stars or upvotes - just talk to yourself from 3 months ago. I keep an almost-daily dev blog written for no one else but me.</p><blockquote>

==== Why post positive things ====
* {{t}} five reasons here: http://tantek.com/2018/357/t3/five-reasons-post-positive-things-promptly

==== Why not to post ====

Perhaps even document thoughts on '''why you might not post''':
* Avoiding self-promotion. Some alternatives:
** post promoting others's good work instead or first
** post something for a community (like an indie [[event]] for a community meetup like [[HWC]])

=== What to post next ===
Have too many things or drafts to post and not sure what to post next or in <span id="What_order_to_post">what order</span>?

* {{t}}:
*# post things from that day, per http://tantek.com/2018/364/t1/sixth-reason-post-positive-things-promptly
*# post previous drafts of positive things oldest to newest from the past week or month, per http://tantek.com/2018/364/t5/post-that-day-then-date-time-previous-week-month


=== What else to post ===
See if any of these resonate: (or add your own when you find sources of inspiration to post)

* Jot down ideas for posts, no matter how incomplete; could just be a word or fragment. Use a text file, notepad, or whatever is easiest for you. Re-visit the list periodically and expand those into posts.
* Anniversaries of projects or activities you started/joined and have kept up with
** publish on the day of or within a few days of the anniversary date
** provide a highlights or a brief summary of what you did on the subject in the past year
** link to previous years's post(s) on the subject
** (good incentive to implement [[on this day]] to help remind you of anniversaries!)

=== Posting to Support Open Source ===
