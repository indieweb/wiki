'''<dfn>Performance</dfn>''' typically refers to the speed, responsiveness, and initial load of a website; performance may also refer to the post type, [[performance (post type)|performance]]. Poor [[silo]] performance can be a motivation for setting up, using, publishing to your own website.

Badly written [[Javascript]], particularly poor use of frameworks, can cause bad site performance, perhaps an example of:
<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
