{{stub}}
There are many '''<dfn>past standards efforts</dfn>''' and the moral of this incomplete historical list is that weâ€˜ve had too many efforts to produce standards, and we've had even more efforts at producing talking shops, and not nearly enough attempts at actually building implementations.

* See [[standards]] for currently actively implemented specifications.

This page is historical from ~2015.
