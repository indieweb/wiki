{{stub}}

'''<dfn>polling</dfn>''' is also known as periodically fetching, and part of the problem with the “just use RSS!” attitude by some old-school bloggers who are ignoring about 15 years of social media UX and protocols work, specifically the “thundering herd” problem as well as the overpolling problem of popular sites; use [[WebSub]] instead per https://tantek.com/2018/024/t4/websub-recommendation.
