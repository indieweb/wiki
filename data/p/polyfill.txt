'''<dfn>polyfill</dfn>''' is a term used to describe providing capabilities to software, that it was not shipped with. As an example jQuery among other things polyfilled CSS selector for many websites, until the new querySelector API was available and allowed newer software to use a standards-compliant built-in feature.
