'''<dfn>Photo hosting</dfn>''' is where you serve photos and other images on the internet, typically for [[photo]] posts and other kinds of [[posts]] with photos.

Photo hosting is one step of many for creating and maintaining a [[photo]] post, in roughly this order but sometimes with steps combined or re-ordered:
* [[photo capture]] — the act of taking a photo on a camera or mobile phone
* [[photo editing]] — editing a photo, often on a local device, often before uploading
* [[photo upload]] - sending a photo from a local device to some place on the internet
* [[photo storage]] - where you store photos that are uploaded, perhaps longterm, and backups
* [[photo hosting]] - where you serve photos displayed in [[posts]]

For UIs to [[create]] a photo post, see:
* [[create#Photo]]

There are some folks that directly host photos from their personal server, and others use shared servers, or even [[silo]] CDNs to host photos

* {{kupietz}} is using Flickr as a CDN in WordPress photo posts

* {{t}} is using and moving towards more use of [[Flickr]] as a CDN, and has used a mix of Instagram, Twitter, Foursquare/Swarm in the past (most of which eventually broke).
