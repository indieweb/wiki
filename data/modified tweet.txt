A '''<dfn>modified tweet</dfn>''' is a [[tweet]] that has been [[reposted]] but modified in some way. The text may be shortened, link(s) removed, or even altered slightly for humorous effect. The text "MT" is commonly prefixed to indicate the tweet is a modified tweet.

* Original tweet: https://twitter.com/mashable/status/478705467888517121
* Modified tweet for humor: https://twitter.com/gRegorLove/status/478706686027239424
