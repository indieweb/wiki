<span style="float:right;height:128px;font-size:128px">🏠</span>

Your '''<dfn>homepage</dfn>''' represents you on the web, typically at the top of your domain, with your name and an [[icon]]ic representation, often marked up with [[h-card]], and fairly commonly one or more streams of recent, topical, or most relevant posts marked up with [[h-entry]].

For work on the IndieWeb.org homepage itself, see:
* '''[[site-homepage]]'''

== Why ==
All the reasons on [[why]] and more.

Use your own [[personal domain]] to own your [[identity]] on the web.

By making your homepage more useful, you will feel more motivated to share your URL instead of just your [[Twitter]] handle or other [[silo]] profile.

__TOC__
== How ==
What should be on your indie web site home page?
=== About You ===
Your homepage should have some basic information about you:
* name
* [[icon]] / [[profile photo]]
* [[communication]] links (aim: mailto: tel: etc. see [http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience] for some UI brainstorming on this)
* other [[about]] / contact information, e.g.
** Links to [[silo]] profile URLs, approximate location, short bio, categories/tags
* marked up with [[h-card]] (see [[Indiewebify.me]] to verify, validate)
* [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain|web-sign-in support]]
** [[rel-me]] links to your other identities on the web

Your home page is the URL you share with people, therefore it's useful to set it up with:
* [[role]] - brief summary of what it is you do
* [[discovery]] of what else you have on your site
* Your local time
* Last seen (last checkin/location post)
* upcoming events
* projects
* [[disclosure]] - disclosures of various types, e.g. cookies or analytics tracking

=== Stream ===
Next, it's quite popular to have:
* [[stream]] of your most recent [[posts]] and other activities.
See the Stream of Updates below for some inspiration.

=== Archive Navigation ===
If you show a stream of recent posts on your home page, it may also be useful to show a small navigation interface for your archives.

More: [[archive navigation]].

=== Previously ===
Among early 2000s bloggers it was popular to also have on your home page:
* [[blogroll]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Simple Homepages ===
Some interesting indieweb home page examples of simple contact/about information (e.g. [[hCard]]), maps for location, live IM status etc. - probably worth expanding and document each of these:
* http://scottbullard.com/ - phone/email links with more: http://scottbullard.com/more.html
* http://www.jaredhanson.net/ - live IM status on Jared's hCard
* http://npdoty.name/ - map as background centered on his current location
* old adactio.com (pre-2012) 
* http://jasonpark.me/ - made to look like graphically browsing a computer filesystem
* https://jacky.wtf/
* https://www.gwern.net/

That and most recent blog post:
* http://ebdesign.se/

That and occasional blog posts:
* http://aralbalkan.com/

The https://bear.im homepage for {{bear}} has a super simple [[hCard]] and then links to the [[hFeed]] and a more substantive About page

=== Stream of Updates ===
All that and most of the content they post online as a stream:

Mixed/composite feed examples with complete posts:
* http://tantek.com/
* http://adactio.com/ (late 2012+) 
* https://aaronparecki.com/ (2016+)

Streams of partial posts / summaries:
* {{voxpelli}} http://voxpelli.com/ – stream of latest blog post titles

Streams of only names/titles of posts:
* {{bear}} https://bear.im/bearlog

Separate feeds: 
* {{voxpelli}} http://voxpelli.com/ – links to separate feeds for bookmarks and social interactions
* http://2015.aaronparecki.com/ (2012-2015)

== Homepage Brainstorming ==
Things which could go on homepages which aren’t currently implemented, or are underimplemented. Sometimes there is an intent to implement.

* [[payment]] links/buttons
* local weather/daylight (extra context)
* people I’ve mentioned recently
* tags I’ve used recently
* actions like subscribe, contact, add to address book
* latest comments

I might be adding links to /me (my profile page) and /about (about the site, license info, powered by, hosted at, etc.) to my homepage. --[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]

=== Signed-in Features ===
When signed-in to your own site, it might be useful to have:
* [[reader]] - integrated reader showing posts from others you follow
** silo examples of such a logged in home page: [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]] - logged in dashboard

=== Sketches ===
I did some homepage sketches/brainstorming [https://github.com/Taproot/design/blob/master/homepage-brainstorming.jpg here] --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 14:32, 18 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Webmention to homepage ===
[[Webmention]]s sent directly to home pages could serve a number of use-cases:
* [[notification]] of a [[person-mention]] (like an indieweb @-mention) on a post somewhere else
* [[invitation]] to an indie [[event]]
* notification of a new private [[message]] received
* allowing other people to tag you in photos or posts

== Silo Examples ==
Silos don't technically give you access to their home page, but they do typically provide you with something resembling a home page, albeit typically at a path (not at the root), and they call it a profile. Though they really should be providing [[subdomain]]s instead of profile paths.

=== Twitter ===
As an example, [[Twitter]] let's you customize your profile page with:
* [[icon]] - upload (min/max resolution/bytes?)
* header image - upload (min/max resolution/bytes?)
* [[bio]] - 160 character text field, @ and # auto-linked.
* [[domain|website]] - auto-linked URL
* [[location]] - ??? character text field.

== Articles ==
Articles and posts about homepage design and features:
