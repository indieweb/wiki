{{emojicon|üè†}}

Your '''<dfn>homepage</dfn>''' represents you on the web, typically at the top of your domain, with your name and an [[icon]]ic representation, often marked up with [[h-card]], and fairly commonly one or more streams of recent, topical, or most relevant posts marked up with [[h-entry]].

For work on the IndieWeb.org homepage itself, see:
* '''[[site-homepage]]'''

== Why ==
All the reasons [[why]] and more.

Use your own [[personal domain]] to own your identity on the web.

By making your homepage more useful, you will feel more motivated to share your URL instead of just your [[Twitter]] handle or other [[social media]] profile.

__TOC__

== How ==
What should be on your indie web site home page?
=== About You ===
Your homepage should have some basic information about you, such as:
* name - whatever name(s) you want people to use for you
* [[icon]] / [[profile photo]]
* [[tagline]] / [[bio]] / [[favorite quotes]] / categories, [[tags]], or other [[about]] info
* Links to other profiles (e.g. community or [[silo]]) URLs 
** [[rel-me]] markup to those you consider and use as other identities on the web
** See: [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain|web-sign-in support]]
* [[contact]] links (txt, email, voice etc.)
* marked up with [[h-card]] (see [[Indiewebify.me]] to verify, validate) for [[autodiscovery]] of the above when people link to you

Your home page is the URL you share with people, therefore you may also want to add:
* [[role]] - brief summary of what it is you do
* [[discovery]] of what else you have on your site
* Your local time (zone)
* Last seen (last checkin/location/city/country)
* upcoming events you plan to attend or participate in, especially if others are welcome
* projects you are working on, especially if contributions are welcome
* [[disclosure]] - disclosures of various types, e.g. cookies or analytics tracking

Depending on your preferred design and media-specific layout, such information can go in the header, main content area, a sidebar, the footer, or distributed among those areas as you prefer!

=== Stream ===
{{main|personal feed}}
Next, it's quite popular to have:
* [[stream]] of your most recent [[posts]] and other activities.
See the Stream of Updates examples below for some inspiration.

=== Archive Navigation ===
If you show a stream of recent posts on your home page, it may also be useful to show a small navigation interface for your archives.

More: [[archive navigation]].

=== Previously ===
Among early 2000s bloggers it was popular to also have on your home page:
* [[blogroll]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Contact Homepages ===
Some interesting homepage examples of simple contact/about information, maps for location, live IM status etc.
* {{bear}}: https://bear.im/ has an [[h-card]] and links to his [[h-feed]] and a more substantive About page in the sidebar
* http://scottbullard.com/ - [[hCard]] phone/email links with more: http://scottbullard.com/more.html
* http://www.jaredhanson.net/ - live IM status on Jared's [[hCard]]
* http://npdoty.name/ - [[hCard]] with map as background centered on his current location
* http://ebdesign.se/ about, elsewhere, and most recent blog post
* old adactio.com (pre-2012) 

=== Stream of Updates ===
{{main|personal_feed#IndieWeb_Examples}}
All that and most of the content they post online as a stream:

Mixed/composite feed examples with complete posts:
* https://tantek.com/ (2010 onward, previously redirected at times to month permalinks 2002-2008)
* https://adactio.com/ (late 2012+) 
* https://aaronparecki.com/ (2016+)

See [[personal_feed#IndieWeb_Examples]] for more examples.

=== Other Examples ===
Some interesting personal create home page examples that are not in clear categories:
* http://jasonpark.me/ - Requires [[JS]], then shows a presentation made to look like graphically browsing a computer filesystem
* https://www.gwern.net/
* https://awarm.space/ ‚Äî ultra minimal short plain text example. 
** Previously apparently used to provide two "primary" streams, "fast" and "slow" series of posts, with only the "fast" stream showing date posted. Maybe check Internet Archive to find that version?

== Homepage Brainstorming ==
Things which could go on homepages which aren‚Äôt currently implemented, or are underimplemented. Sometimes there is an intent to implement.

* [[payment]] links/buttons
* local weather/daylight (extra context)
* people I‚Äôve mentioned recently
* tags I‚Äôve used recently
* actions like subscribe, contact, add to address book
* latest comments
* ‚Äúlive‚Äù banner image/gallery made from recent posts tagged with #banner or similar, to show off recent photo highlights without requiring a separate UI to manage it

I might be adding links to /me (my profile page) and /about (about the site, license info, powered by, hosted at, etc.) to my homepage. --[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]

=== Signed-in Features ===
When signed-in to your own site, it might be useful to have:
* [[reader]] - integrated reader showing posts from others you follow
** silo examples of such a logged in home page: [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]] - logged in dashboard

It may also be interesting to change your homepage for visitors who have signed in (/and are in your contact list etc)
* Showing replies, likes and other posts not usually shown on a homepage feed for signed-in viewers

=== Sketches ===
I did some homepage sketches/brainstorming [https://github.com/Taproot/design/blob/master/homepage-brainstorming.jpg here] --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 14:32, 18 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Webmention to homepage ===
[[Webmention]]s sent directly to home pages could serve a number of use-cases:
* [[notification]] of a [[person-mention]] (like an indieweb @-mention) on a post somewhere else
* [[invitation]] to an indie [[event]]
* notification of a new private [[message]] received
* allowing other people to tag you in photos or posts

== Silo Examples ==
Silos don't technically give you access to their home page, but they do typically provide you with something resembling a home page, albeit typically at a path (not at the root), and they call it a profile. Though they really should be providing [[subdomain]]s instead of profile paths.

=== Twitter ===
As an example, [[Twitter]] let's you customize your profile page with:
* [[icon]] - upload (min/max resolution/bytes?)
* [[header image]] - upload (min/max resolution/bytes?)
* [[bio]] - 160 character text field, @ and # auto-linked.
* [[domain|website]] - auto-linked URL
* [[location]] - ??? character text field.
