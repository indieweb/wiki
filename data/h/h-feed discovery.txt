{{stub}}

'''<dfn>h-feed discovery</dfn>''' is a proposed method for publishers to indicate the presence of an h-feed on a page (or representing a page) through the use of a [[rel-alternate]] link with <code>type="application/mf2+html"</code> which may link to a fragment within the same page. See: [[application/mf2+html]] for further details and discussion.
