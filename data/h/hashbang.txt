{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>hashbang</dfn>''' (or <dfn>hash-bang fragment</dfn>) is the character sequence <code>#!</code> inside a URL, typically at the start of the path, including in post permalinks (like Twitter did 2010-2012), and is an [[antipattern]] you should never use as part of your personal site [[URL design]]. 

== Criticism ==
=== Fragile ===
Links into a site that start with a hashbang (or any similar "routing" string like <code>/#/</code>) depend on there always being [[Javascript]] at the root of the site that can parse and recognize the link, and either display what it's supposed to show, or redirect to an actual permalink.

Thus as soon as the home page of a site changes, e.g. drops such scripted "routing", all hashbang links break.

Examples:
* Twitter broke their own hashbang links, e.g. https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23microformats used to give # microformats hashtag results but now just redirects to their "explore" page.

=== In General ===

<blockquote>…it most definitely _is_ about the hashbangs. This technique, on its own, is destructive to the web. The implementation is inappropriate, even as a temporary measure or as a downgrade experience.</blockquote>
