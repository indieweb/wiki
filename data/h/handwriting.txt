'''<dfn>Handwriting</dfn>''' is a great, tactile, time-tested method for creating content, so who wouldn't want to use it as part of a user interface for posting to one's personal website?


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{chrisaldrich}} made his first post from a handwritten index card with a fountain pen to his website on [https://boffosocko.com/2021/11/23/55798697/ 2021-11-23]. 
** He used a custom app on his Android phone to take a photo of the handwritten index card which saves the image to Google Drive. Opening the file in Google Docs automatically does [[OCR]] on the photo and places the text into the document. The document creation in Google Drive triggers an [[IFTTT]] recipe that uses a [[webhook]] to [[Micropub]] [https://boffosocko.com/2020/01/21/using-ifttt-to-syndicate-pesos-content-from-social-services-to-wordpress-using-micropub/ workflow (described elsewhere)] that posts the text from the Google Doc to his [[WordPress]] website as a draft. He can then edit any issues/errors from the OCR, add photos, etc. and then publish the post with optional [[syndication]] targets like Twitter, Mastodon, and [[micro.blog]].
__TOC__

* Daniel Burgarth runs https://www.stempen.org/, a site about pens in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), that is handwritten in pen with active URL links. It states that it was built with technology from [http://www.styluslabs.com/ Stylus Labs].

* [https://benstokes.dev/ Ben Stokes] has a  handwritten website [https://daily.tinyprojects.dev/ blog] built using his own project [https://paperwebsite.com/ PaperWebsite].

== Platforms ==
* [https://paperwebsite.com/ PaperWebsite] is a platform that allows one to write on any kind of paper, capture the writing via photo and uses AI to convert the writing to text and posts it to a custom website. One can then edit and publish the content.
