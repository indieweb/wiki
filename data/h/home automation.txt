'''<dfn>Home automation</dfn>''' is the use of computers to control home functions. Also known as a 'smart' or 'connected' home.

One of the principles of the Indieweb is owning your own data. At the simplest, the new home automation tools are increasingly siloed systems that cannot even be controlled without the manufacturer's server.

== Brainstorming ==

Home automation could be an opportunity to integrate the physical world with your website. This can be in the form of new ways to notify you of activity on your website(your Hue lights turn red when you get a webmention).

In reverse, some individuals may wish to gather and post data on their home. E.g. silo example: 
* https://twitter.com/houseofcoates
