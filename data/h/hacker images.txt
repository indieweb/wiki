In the early 2010s, such a deliberately staged photo set https://www.flickr.com/groups/hacker-images/pool/ was placed on Flickr with a permissive license to see if news media would use them in articles, which they subsequently did, not knowing that the images were placed there deliberately for them to find and use.
