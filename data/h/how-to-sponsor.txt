== About IndieWebCamp ==
IndieWebCamp is a two-day gathering of web creators building and sharing open web technologies to advance the state of the Web. The first day is about discussing how to empower people to own their identities and data, followed by a day of hacking & creating. IndieWebCamp first started as a small event in Portland, Oregon and has since grown to 5+ main events per year in the US and Europe, as well as biweekly events in 5+ cities worldwide. IndieWebCamp is maintained by volunteers around the world, and all conferences are run by the community.

<blockquote>
"What happens if Yahoo freezes your online account, loses your data, or goes out of business? What happens if you decide to move all your Facebook photos to another site? What if you want to reply to someone on Twitter using Google+? And the [IndieWeb] builds software that answers these questions." - [http://www.wired.com/2013/08/indie-web/ Klint Finley, Wired]
</blockquote>

=== Attendees ===
IndieWebCamp events routinely attract core developers and designers from Facebook, Google, Mozilla, Esri, and W3C contributors to HTML & CSS, as well as prominent journalists and writers looking for the next generation of publishing on the web. The indieweb.org wiki gets over 25K views a month, and the community chat room regularly has 100+ people and is steadily rising. IndieWebCamp events have been covered by Wired, Slate, and other major news publications. Each event is kept small for quality and collaboration purposes. Expect 20-50 people per IndieWebCamp event, and 10-20 at each bi-weekly event.

<blockquote>
"[Participants at IndieWebCamp practice] classic Internet innovation: created and deployed at the edge, not the center; rough, and constantly being improved."

"In their early work they're taking advantage of the good things the social network 'silos,' as they call them, can offer, while ensuring that the data we create, and much of the conversation it engenders, lives in our own home-base sites."

"And if we're lucky, and help these folks by testing it out on our own devices, it's a vital part of the future." - [http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/25/indiewebcamps_create_tools_for_a_new_internet.html Dan Gillmor, Slate.com]
</blockquote>

=== Topics ===
* Blogging, publishing, and journalism on the web 
* Storing and sharing personal data 
* Data ownership and online identity
* Emerging web standards and protocols 
* OAuth, IndieAuth, and future aspects of authentication
* Microformats, Micropub, Webmention, Backfeed, and other publishing methods 
* Personal and corporate web security

<blockquote>"Much of the appeal in avoiding corporate silos is that eventually the companies go out of business and take all your data with them. The IndieWeb solution to these problems is to run your own site, retain full control over your data and syndicate it to those corporate sites so that you can still participate in the larger conversation." - [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/18/remember_wordpress_pingbacks_the_w3c_wants_us_to_use_them_across_the_whole_web/ Scott Gilbertson, theregister.co.uk]</blockquote>
