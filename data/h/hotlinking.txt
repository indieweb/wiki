'''<dfn>Hotlinking</dfn>''' is the embedding of a resource (typically an image) from another website on your own site.

== Downsides ==

* The image might be (re)moved on the other website, leaving you with a broken image on the page.

* When your site gets a lot of traffic, you place a burden on the other website hosting the image.
* The other website can see your traffic (or at least the people who request the image), and analyse basic information about your visitors.
