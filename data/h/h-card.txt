{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card h-card]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up people, organizations, and venues on web sites, and supersedes hCard. Colloquially many will use the term "h-card" as a synonym for an online equivalent of a business card since it often contains identity information including name, address, photo, and related contact information.

== Why ==
Marking up your [[homepage]] profile with a minimal h-card including '''name''', '''url''' and '''photo''' properties covers most h-card usage on the IndieWeb:

* Feed [[readers]] display your profile photo next to your posts
* [[reply]] posts to your posts show your author profile in their [[reply context]]s
* Posts that you reply to show your author profile in their [[comments]] display
* Apps you sign into with [[IndieAuth]] (or which otherwise know your URL) auto-fill and auto-update your name and photo
* [[Gravatar]]-like lookups based on [[Why_web_sign-in#Why_not_email|domain instead of email address]]

== How ==
=== How to markup ===
You can make a minimal [[h-card]] for your name, photo, and URL with two elements and one classname, for example:

<pre>
<a class="h-card" href="http://waterpigs.co.uk">
 <img src="/photo.png" alt="" />
 Barnaby Walters
</a>
</pre>

Details for creating an h-card on [[WordPress]] can be found on [[Getting_Started_on_WordPress#Identity_2|Getting Started on WordPress]].

You can include an h-card when you mention someone in a post. Start with minimal markup such as:
<pre>
 <a class="h-card" href="https://aaronparecki.com">Aaron Parecki</a>
</pre> 

When your mention has a link to their site, they can receive an [[person-mention|@-mention]]. If you want to communicate that the post is about this person or that they are a subject of or in the post, use a [[person-tag]].

== Validators ==

You can check your homepage h-card for completeness and common mistakes using these validators:

* [https://pin13.net/mf2/ pin13.net mf2 parser] (raw parsed JSON)

== Issues ==

From a pure user features perspective, and assuming no [[antipatterns#invisible_metadata|invisible metadata]], how are the following accomplished (that is, with h-card)?

* I'd like to show some personal profile information (for example, name) on my posts, but not my picture. I may want to show additional profile information on another page, for example. '''/about'''. That may include my picture, or it may not (including [[icon]]).

* When I [[comment]], [[like]], [[repost]], or [[rsvp]] to someone else's post, and they render that response ([[comments-presentation]]), I'd like to let them show my additional profile information, including my picture, if they choose. ''[[authorship]] handles some of this, but maybe not all, for example, the case where I don't show my picture anywhere on my site.''

* Similarly, when I log into a site like this wiki with [[IndieAuth]] (etc.), I'd like the site to be able to discover my additional profile information, including my picture, to show on my profile page, activity, or other appropriate places. ''[https://microformats.org/wiki/representative-hcard-parsing representative-hcard-parsing] gets close, but not all the way. [[#Brainstorming]] below is a straw man extension that could help.''

From an h-card specific viewpoint, here are some additional issues / questions:
* Some people (e.g. [[User:David.shanske.com|GWG]], [[User:kartikprabhu.com| Kartik]], [[User:Snarfed.org]], [[User:Mowens.com]], {{gRegor}}, {{kisik21}}, {{LewisCowles}}) would like a way to include both a minimal h-card on a page *and* a link to a "complete" h-card with more information, for example, contact details or photo. [[authorship]] and [https://microformats.org/wiki/representative-hcard-parsing representative-hcard-parsing] are both related but slightly different, and both currently only use the inline h-card if it's available. The inline h-card could include a link to the expanded h-card.

* Along the same lines, some people (e.g. [[User:Snarfed.org]], [[User:Mowens.com]], {{gRegor}}) would like to make some parts of their h-card invisible everywhere, but still available to programmatic consumers. Examples include rel-me links to some silos, public encryption key. Related: [[antipatterns#invisible_metadata]]
** On my site currently, my author hCard on each post is invisible because I do not feel the need to display my photo, URL, and name on every post. This would be different if it was a multiple-author site. {{gRegor}}
** I too have made the h-card invisible on my home page because I don't want details to show there for design reasons. [[User:jeremycherfas.net|Jeremy Cherfas]]

=== What should be a <code>u-url</code> on the h-card and what shouldn’t? ===
'''A:''' The home page and any other URLs that represent the person or organization. The h-card specification was updated 2019-05-08 to clarify this. [https://microformats.org/wiki/index.php?title=h-card&diff=67001&oldid=66804&rcid=103888]

Previous discussion:
# [https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card The specification] says <code>u-url</code> is for the identity’s “home page”.
# [https://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-authoring#Link_it_up hCard authoring’s Link it up section] recommends to add “links to your website, your social network profiles and other sites that represent you specifically to your hCard with the class name <code>url</code>.” (Note that this is linked to indirectly by h-card as h-card-authoring has yet to be written.) And goes on to show [https://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-authoring#connect_with_yourself an example] where [[rel-me]] links are given the class.

There are also examples of both readings:

# {{aaronpk}} only includes his homepages <code><nowiki>aaronparecki.com</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>w7apk.com</nowiki></code> as url properties on his homepage h-card. External profiles can only be found through [[rel-me]] parsing.
# {{t}} includes all his [[rel-me]] links as url properties on his homepage h-card.

What should the general advice be? Are [[silo]] identities still homepages to be marked up with <code>u-url</code>?

# {{jacky}} thinks (2022-05-17) that pages that have usable markup to the IndieWeb (like [[microformats]]) should be the only ones linked up from one's [[h-card]], everything else can be linked via [[rel-me]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
As a basic [[building-block]] of the IndieWeb, an h-card helps to establish one's online [[identity]]. Numerous examples can be found on the [https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card#Examples_in_the_wild Microformats Wiki] as well as a few of the ones below:

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has an h-card in the [https://boffosocko.com right sidebar of his homepage] with both human-readable and machine readable data

=== Martijn van der Ven ===
{{martijnvdven}} ([https://twitter.com/martijnvdven self proclaimed] master of “the art of the h-card”) has an extensive h-card on http://vanderven.se/martijn/, including experimental properties like [https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-experimental-properties#p-x-dietary-preference dietary preference], experimental formats like [https://microformats.org/wiki/measure-brainstorming h-measure], a <code>dt-bday</code> specified to the minute, and more!
* If people take away anything from his card, he would like it to be the [[pronoun]] mark-up.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}}: I have an h-card in the footer of each [[h-entry]] on gregorlove.com, but would like to experiment with marking up my existing information on my [[about]] page and linking to that from each post.

== Brainstorming ==
=== partial vs complete ===
One possible solution for the [[#Issues|partial plus complete h-card issue]] is to include a rel-me link to the full h-card and *not* mark up the partial profile information on the home page as an h-card. The [https://microformats.org/wiki/representative-h-card-parsing representative-h-card-parsing] algorithm would then follow the rel-me link and use its full data. It doesn't seem ideal, but it'd work.

One problem with this is that the home page usually has many rel-me links, for example, to silos, and we don't yet have a way to denote the "canonical" one. {{gRegor}}, [[User:Mowens.com]], and others have proposed using u-uid and/or a new rel-canonical property for this.

* I wonder if there is anything we can do with <code>uid</code> to specify which h-card is the most complete / canonical identity h-card. — {{martijnvdven}}
* {{jacky}} uses "rel=canonical" on his representative h-card to help with disambiguation.
* <del>Could [https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-author rel-author] be suitable for this? It would definitely make sense for linking post pages to author URLs, perhaps less so when the publisher wants to have a partial h-card on their homepage and an expanded on on, say, an /about page — {{barnabywalters}}</del>
* For the “partial h-card on homepage and expanded on separate page” use case, rel=about could be ideal for this, as “about” is a very commonly used term for “additional information about this website/person” both in UI and URL design. It wouldn’t overload rel-author, and could be chained, e.g. a consuming implementation could find a minimal h-card on a post page, fetch the url property to find the same minimal representative h-card, and then follow a rel=about link to a page with a complete h-card on — {{barnabywalters}}
** If this was accepted, we could simply tack on addendums to [[authorship]] and [[representative h-card]] which say “once the author/representative h-card has been found, if a rel=about link is found on the same page, the consumer can optionally fetch that page and parse it for an h-card (matching the representative url or uid) with more information about the person” or similar — {{barnabywalters}}
** Searching [[indiemap]] data from {{snarfed}} (thanks!) shows:
*** 150x rel=About
*** 95x rel=about
*** 12x other variations (about…, about,, etc)
*** on further analysis, it looks like all of the rel=About/about usage in indiemap is from one domain, and not being used to link to an expanded profile page, so afaik there’s zero evidence of it being used for that in the wild
* the [https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth#users_with_separate_contact_pages relmeauth] [https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth#detailed_algorithm spec] suggests just using rel-me to link to an expanded contact info page, and assumes that consumers will look through rel-me URLs which match the same domain and fetch them if they’re looking for additional contact info — {{barnabywalters}}
** examples of this in the wild?
** aaronparecki.com has a rel-me to aaronparecki.com/aaronpk, which contains follower and following counts, but no additional h-card information
** {{snarfed}} ran a query on the [[indiemap]] data and found [https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=586366768654:047463741d5343c3ab218b152561b005&project=api-project-962594101220&ws=!1m5!1m4!1m3!1sapi-project-962594101220!2sbquxjob_7951a0a1_1845465c1ca!3sUS 29 examples of the same-domain rel-me publishing pattern]

=== pronouns use-cases ===
Adding more information and additional properties unlocks more possibilities:

* Allows apps to find and display/use your preferred [[pronoun]]s
** which apps? which specific use-cases does a consuming app need to show a pronouns?
*** A [[reader|social reader]] can use them for shorter references in actions ("they liked this photo") {{jacky}} 2022-07-03
* …

=== h-card generator ===
We need an h-card generator, any volunteers?

Something to replace this: 

{{warning|The following generates a microformats1 hCard instead of a microformats2 h-card.<br>You probably don't want to use this tool until it has been updated}}
The [[microformats]] website has a [https://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator fill-in-the-blanks hCard generator] that will allow one to input all of the data they'd like to display and it will automatically mark all of it up properly so that one can cut and paste the semantic HTML into a web page.
