A '''<dfn>highlight</dfn>''' is a [[reaction]] post of a range of content that consists typically of just a restyling (like a yellow background as you might use a yellow physical highlighter, or an underline).

== Why ==
People highlight books and other physical texts, as well as do so with revisions in proprietary software like Microsoft Word, thus there is some evidence they may want to do so with [[posts]] on the web as well.

== How To ==
No specific how to post a highlight post has been determined. More real world examples are needed for study before reasoned proposals can be made / implemented that would be able to support a desired presentation.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} has been experimenting with highlighting in posts since around October 2016. In some [[read]] posts, in which he also archives the original post, he uses the html [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_mark.asp &lt;mark&gt; tag] sometimes with a class using his initials and/or a date/time stamp (when the post date/time don't otherwise agree with the original highlight time) to indicate the originator and date/time of the highlight. The color of the highlight can be easily handled in CSS and as the mark html tag is not often used, it doesn't typically conflict with the uses via other sites.  

Because of the way his [[read]] posts are created, the matching of the original canonical URL allows other highlighting/annotation layers, like [[Hypothes.is]] for example, to also add their highlights and annotations over his pages as well. See note at [http://boffosocko.com/2017/01/19/pressforward-and-hypothes-is-work-great-together/ Pressforward and Hypothesis Work Great Together]. In some sense this gives him the ability to recreate the functionality of turning on/off the highlights of others, a functionality offered by Amazon Kindle (see section on https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201241990 View Popular Highlights & Public Notes].

He's [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-03-13/1489433078617900 considering] using a microformat (perhaps `p-highlight-of`) on highlights for parsers to be able to find/consume them in the future to differentiate between other similar mark up including `u-quotation-of` and `h-cite`.

In book reviews since Summer 2016, he has also been adding blockquotes containing highlighted text exported from his Amazon Kindle indicating a particular highlighter color which he also uses to delineate particular meanings. Example: [http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/23/book-review-fletch-reflected-by-gregory-mcdonald/#Guide+to+highlight_colors Guide to Highlight Colors].

Another older example of a highlight on his site is [http://boffosocko.com/2010/06/04/continuum-functional-integrals/ Continuum functional integrals]. This was created as a [[quotation]] at the time (given the technology), but the original intent was to highlight the particular quote with a much longer textbook. Instead of including simply a quotation, he included a photograph of the portion of the text in the post along with a blockquoted copy he meant to highlight.

[https://boffosocko.com/2018/06/22/highlighted-a-reply-to-laying-the-standards-for-a-blogging-renaissance-by-aaron-davis/ 2018-06-22] As an experiment, I created an explicit highlight post type on my website using some custom code in conjunction with [[Post Kinds Plugin]] which gives me a specific [https://boffosocko.com/kind/highlight/ archive of highlights] as well as a subscribe-able [https://boffosocko.com/kind/highlight/feed/ highlight feed]. Links for highlights are marked up with an experimental <code>u-highlight-of</code> [[microformat]].

=== Kartik Prabhu ===
{{kartikprabhu}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-03-13/1489435417857700 uses] a version of [[bookmark]] + [[fragmention]] to effectuate highlights on his site. Example: https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/2016-12#bm-resilientweb-choose-tools-wisely

== Silo Examples ==
=== Hypothesis ===
[[Hypothes.is]] is an annotations-based [[silo]] that allows one to both highlight and [https://hyp.is/-SIQ2AgtEeeiYRePGzBZUw/indieweb.org/highlight add notes/marginalia onto an overlapping layer on pages]. These notes have permalink URLs and they can also be shared to other sites.

=== Medium ===
[[Medium]] may have features resembling highlighting.

=== Twitter ===
{{kevinmarks}} has highlighted text within Twitter using [https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/840746589002072064 photos of actual texts]. This relatively frequently used functionality (though often using screenshots) is commonly used to get around the 140 character limit found on Twitter.

=== GoodReads ===
[[Goodreads]] in conjunction with its corporate parent [[Amazon]] allows one to sync their highlights and annotations (or notes) from e-books on the Amazon Kindle family of devices to their GoodReads account. UI features and data for [[archive|archives]] of books include the title and author, cover image, the text of the highlight, and the abilities to [[annotation|annotate]] or [[comments|comment]] and [[like]] the highlight, to make the highlight public or [[private_posts|private]], to delete it, and to mark it as a [[spoiler_post|spoiler]].

When made, highlights will show up in one's user feed for others to [[comment]] or [[like]] them. Here is an example of a highlight within a feed:

=== Highly.co ===
[[Highly]] is a [[silo]] web app that allows users to highlight content on web pages and within apps. Highlights on the service are cloud-synced, searchable, and shareable. On [https://medium.com/highlight-to-share/sparking-the-public-conversation-c5fd78d9bfb3 2019-04-17 Highly announced] on Medium that they would be joining [[Twitter]]. Though they indicate that their service will change somewhat and remain "up", it might be a good idea to [[export]] your data.

UI example of a highlight in situ. The service overlays a text "timeline" and visually indicates the percentage amount of text as well as it's relative location in the piece along with an estimated reading time for the entire text.

== Other Examples ==
=== Photos of Highlighted Text ===

Needs more research, documentation, screenshots.

== Brainstorming ==
=== bookmark a fragmention ===
At a minimum, a highlight post could be represented by a [[bookmark]] of a [[fragmention]]. 

The receiver of the highlight reaction, could determine this automatically, and decide to provide highlighting with a default highlight color that goes well with their post styling.

Alternatively, since highlights of paper text typical consist of the person doing the highlighting making a deliberate choice of <em>how</em> to stylistically express the highlighting, that stylistic expression could be considered as an additional attribute / property of a highlight post.
