{{stub}}

'''<dfn>href.li</dfn>''' is a link redirector that Tumblr adds to all outgoing links from posts; its ostensible purpose is to block known harmful outgoing links more quickly than theyâ€™d be able to remove such links from posts, but it is also likely used for analytics and user tracking as well.
