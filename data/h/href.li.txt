'''<dfn>href.li</dfn>''' is an [[outbound link wrapper|outbound link redirector]] that [[Tumblr]] & [[WordPress.com]] add to all outgoing links from posts; its ostensible purpose is to block known harmful outgoing links more quickly than theyâ€™d be able to remove such links from posts, but it is also likely used for analytics and user tracking as well.
