'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry h-entry]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up blog [[posts]] on web sites. It can also be used to mark-up any other episodic or time series based content.

== Why ==
=== Why publish ===
Adding h-entry markup to your [[homepage]] and [[permalinks]] is the simplest way to make those pages easily readable by consuming code like indieweb [[readers]].

Adding h-entry to your post pages enables post information [[discovery]] on your permalinks, which is useful for a variety of things, including:
* [[reply]] context syndication
* syndication of your [[replies]] from your site as comments on the permalinks of the sites that you reply to.

Adding h-entry to your home page enables:
* subscribing to your posts directly from your home page (no separate feed needed).
* A building block for adding [[PuSH]] 0.4 support for real time subscribers of your updates

Any page with an explicit author and publication date can use h-entry and enables:
* Nicer [[link-preview]]s, especially with an optional [[u-featured]] image
* For example: W3C specs like [https://w3.org/TR/webmention Webmention] and [https://w3.org/TR/micropub Micropub] have their name, editors, publication date all marked up with h-entry.
=== Why consume ===
By using a [[microformats2]] parser, and looking for h-entry items, your code will automatically get both h-entry and classic [[hAtom]] post information from people's post pages and home pages, which are published in total in combination by a double digit percentage of the web (thanks to [[WordPress]] default templates including such markup for 5+ years), and especially cutting edge IndieWeb sites.

HTML on a page is historically more accurate than [[feed files]] (see that page for more details on why).

Thus for the best user experience, your consuming code should first consume the h-entry (and by backward compat of such parsers, hAtom) of pages before looking at secondary side files.

== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Use h-entry to markup:
* [[posts]], including:
** [[notes]]
** [[articles]]
** [[comments]]
** ... and all other post types

A list of possible properties can be found [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Core_Properties on the microformats wiki].

h-entries will typically be used in two places: alone on [[post]] permalink pages and in plural on [[feed]] pages. 

On post permalink pages the h-entry should be the top-level microformat (not nested under anything).

For feed pages with multiple h-entrys, if you would like to omit the author property on the individual h-entrys on the page, you can wrap them in an [[h-feed]] and put the author info on the h-feed. This will allow the author information to be discovered by the [[authorship]] algorithm.

=== How to consume h-entry ===
For how to consume feeds of multiple h-entry posts, see [[feed#How_To_Consume|How To Consume Feeds]].

To consume a single h-entry:
* look for the first h-entry on the page. If none are found, this page does not represent a post.

For each h-entry, regardless of whether they’re being treated as a single post or part of a feed:
* to find the author of the h-entry, use the [[authorship]] algorithm
* to determine how to display the post as a comment, use the [[comment-presentation#How_to_display|comment presentation]] algorithm
* to determine the published datetime:
** if the h-entry has a <var>published</var> or <var>updated</var> property which is a valid datetime
*** if the datetime is floating (i.e. has no timezone), use the [[datetime#implying_timezone_from_webmentions|implied timezone]] heuristic to determine the timezone
** if the fixed published datetime is in the future, cap it to the present
*** you may wish to preserve the source timezone in the derived time, and optionally also allow a small window within which “future” posts are accepted e.g. 10 minutes
** if there was no datetime, let the published datetime of the post be the datetime it was first seen

When notified of an update to a h-entry, either by [[webmention]] or [[PuSH]] or any other plumbing:
* optionally archive current status of 
* update the <var>updated</var> property to be the updated date of the post using the same datetime resolving process given above
* re-apply the above per-h-entry algorithm, ignoring any updates to the <var>published</var>

See also the processes documented on [[comment]] for handling incoming comments, updates and deletions.

==== Issues ====
===== move general processing =====
Many of the processes documented on [[comment]] (e.g. deletion) can be applied equally to other cases of h-entry consumption (e.g. in a reader), and some of the detail given here applies to comments processing (e.g. datetime processing). Anything which is applicable to general h-entry processing should be moved here, leaving only anything ''specific'' to the comment use-case on [[comment]], and these algorithm referred to from there --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 05:33, 9 June 2014 (PDT)
===== bad hentry properties =====
Some h-entrys encountered are missing a "content" property and have just the implied "p-name" property which end up with an inappropriate value for the name. These URLs were sent via pingback to [https://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified a blog post] on aaronparecki.com, and are [[hEntry]] posts rather than the microformats2 version.
* [[WordPress]] classic [[microformats]] "hentry" markup:

** http://blogmobile.itude.com/2014/04/08/checklist-for-building-an-api/
** Analysis: Hypothesis: Perhaps the default WordPress core "hentry" with broken themes (that lack the rest of the hentry properties) is the source of the problem.
** Proposed resolution: Perhaps classic microformats backcompat parsing should not get any implied properties, since no classic microformats authors ever expect implied properties to happen.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Pretty much everyone on the IndieWeb publishes [[h-entry]] because it is a fundamental building block for the richer UX of [[Webmentions]] of federating and displaying [[comments]], and showing higher fidelity [[reply-context]]s on reply pages as well.

E.g. see people's personal sites linked from [[chat-names]].

== What uses it ==
Numerous [[projects]] and sites are parsing and consuming h-entry for various purposes, including:
* [[reply-context]] - see in particular [[reply-context#IndieWeb_Examples|indieweb sites]] that show reply context information parsed from h-entry + [[h-card]]
* [[comment-presentation]] - e.g. see [[comment-presentation#Current_Indiewebcamp_Practices|indieweb sites]] that show comments on posts syndicated in via parsing h-entry from others' reply posts.
In short, [[h-entry]] is <em>the</em> key building block for the indieweb. It represents a unit of content, to be syndicated, for a variety of use-cases.

== Requests ==
Requests to add h-entry support. Both publishing and consuming code.
