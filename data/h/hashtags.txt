{{stub}}

'''<dfn>hashtags</dfn>''' are the use of the hash "#" symbol followed immediately by a word/phrase/abbreviation to explicitly denote a topic inline in a [[post]]. Popularized on [[Twitter]], they're now everpresent on [[Instagram]] and other [[silos]] where they link to aggregations of posts inside those silos with those tags.

This page is specifically about '''hashtags'''. For general concept of tags and tagging content, see:
* '''[[tags]]'''

== Markup ==

Use [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag rel=tag] on hashtag links. If you're using [[h-entry]], use p-category as well.

== Discovery ==
How do we discover indieweb posts tagged with a particular tag? It’s a problem well suited to centralised hubs.

Could we get services like tagboard to start indexing indieweb posts, not just posts in silos?

== IndieWeb examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com to auto-link hashtags on his posts to his own [[tag]] aggregation page since 2013-03-08.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] on waterpigs.co.uk to auto-link to a /tags page containing a list of links to content which is tagged with that tag (as per hypermedia API design, [http://waterpigs.co.uk/tags/music example]) since [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/285/ 2012-09-22]. This probably needs some js/iframe goodness to pull that content in --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 05:57, 19 April 2013 (PDT)

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} uses hashtags in his posts to tags on the post itself, so it can be used to categorise his content more easily. This has the added benefit of owning Twitter-specific interactions if using a certain hashtag. Since [https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/01/cr6uw/ 2020-01-13], see [https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/05/dhrdl/ a recent example with auto-linked hashtags]

== FAQ ==
=== Autolinking hashtags ===
'''Where should hashtags in [[posts]] be auto-linked to?'''

Link them to a page on your site which aggregates posts tagged with that tag. It’s fine for this to just redirect to, for example, a google search of your site for that tag, but by always linking to a URL you control you can improve it/self-host it later.

== Silo support ==
Silos that support hashtag aggregation on their own content.

Single post-type hashtag aggregations:
* [[Twitter]] - [[notes]] (with embedded media, but not displayed by default, you have to twiddle them open)
* [[Flickr]] - [[photos]] (and [[videos]], but they don't play on tag aggregation pages, so effectively they're just images as well - poster-images from videos)

Composite post-type hashtag aggregations:
* [[Tumblr]] - Tumbler has an amazing display of hetergenous post types in a single tag aggregation grid.
** e.g. http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/cortexiphan shows a tag grid of the following post types
** [[photo]], including animated GIFs
** [[video]]
** [[note]]
** quote
** post with embedded media (photo or video), at least partially displayed by default

== Limitations ==
It appears that most platforms/silos limit hashtags to:
* _a-zA-Z0-9 characters
* Twitter, max length 139 (since Tweet length is 140)
** Twitter max promoted trend (hashtag) is 20.[https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170082?lang=en]
* most sites disallow hashtags that are just numbers (exception: [[Instagram]] allows them)
* some sites disallow hashtags that start with numbers (exception: [[Twitter]] near the end of 2009 started supporting hashtags that start with numbers per the increased frequency of use, e.g. [https://twitter.com/hashtag/2009resolution #2009resolution].)

== Brainstorming ==
=== person tag in plain text ===
* See: [[person-tag#Plain_text_authoring|person-tag plain text authoring]]

=== Regex ===
Check out Twitter's regex: https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text/blob/master/js/twitter-text.js#L135-L141

The following are a coarse approximations which will miss numerous international (non-English) hashtags.
* <code>/#[_a-zA-Z0-9]{1,139}/</code> is a regex that will match common hashtags per the [[#Limitations]] documented above, while liberally allowing numbers-only and numbers-starting hashtags, limited to hashtags that will fit on Twitter.
* <code>/#\w{1,139}/</code> is shorter.

=== more characters ===
{{t}} I have use-cases for more characters than the "usual" / Twitter’s regex. E.g. (from https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)
* ' ': "Needs Thought" (will use "__" for ' ' per [[Falcon#tags_with_spaces]] as noted below)
* '-': "css-ui"
* '/': "unknown/future spec"

=== hashtags for tags with spaces ===
Examples:
* Many [[WordPress]] blogs have categories with spaces in them.
* [https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html#ltcategorygtSubelementOfLtitemgt Feed Validator doc of category element] has <code><nowiki><category>Grateful Dead</category></nowiki></code> example
So having a way for hashtags to link to categories with spaces is desirable
* {{t}}: some thoughts here for now: [[Falcon#tags_with_spaces]]
** Leaning towards "__" (double underscore = space)


== IndieWeb-centric hashtags ==
Some hashtags commonly used by the IndieWeb community:
* #IndieWeb (naturally)

* #IndieWebCamp

* [[own_your_data#Hashtag|#ownyourdata]]

* [https://twitter.com/hashtag/newwwyear?f=tweets&vertical=default #newwwyear]
** Started by [http://jensimmons.com/ Jen Simmons] on Twitter as a means of using the idea of New Year's resolutions for taking small, but concrete steps towards building and improving one's website
