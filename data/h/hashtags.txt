{{stub}}

'''<dfn>hashtags</dfn>''' are the use of the hash "#" symbol followed immediately by a word/phrase/abbreviation to explicitly denote a topic inline in a [[post]]. Popularized on [[Twitter]], they're now everpresent on [[Instagram]] and other [[silos]] where they link to aggregations of posts inside those silos with those tags.

This page is specifically about '''hashtags''' the specific concept, how to implement, examples on sites. For related pages, see:
* '''[[:Category:hashtags]]''' — for notable IndieWeb related hashtags documented on the wiki
* '''[[tags]]''' — for the general concept of tags and tagging content
* '''[[tag page]]''' — for the page displayed when you click on a hashtag
* '''[[tags page]]''' — a page showing all the tags used by a particular person / profile

== How to ==
=== Markup ===

Use [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag rel=tag] on hashtag links. If you're using [[h-entry]], use p-category as well.

== Discovery ==
How do we discover indieweb posts tagged with a particular tag? It’s a problem well suited to centralised hubs.

Could we get services like tagboard to start indexing indieweb posts, not just posts in silos?

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com to auto-link hashtags on his posts to his own [[tag]] aggregation page since 2013-03-08.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] on waterpigs.co.uk to auto-link to a /tags page containing a list of links to content which is tagged with that tag (as per hypermedia API design, [http://waterpigs.co.uk/tags/music example]) since [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/285/ 2012-09-22]. This probably needs some js/iframe goodness to pull that content in --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 05:57, 19 April 2013 (PDT)

=== Tantek ===
{{main|tags#Tantek}}
{{t}} has published automatically marked up hashtags since 2016-01-26.
* http://tantek.com/2016/002/t2/change-clothing-inspired-tomorrowland
** note markup in source: <code>class="p-category auto-tag"</code> generated by [[Falcon]]’s <code>[[auto_tag]]</code> function.

Implementation notes:
* regex used: <code>/(^|\s)#([\w\:\.\/\-]){1,139}/</code>

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} uses hashtags in his posts to tags on the post itself, so it can be used to categorise his content more easily. This has the added benefit of owning Twitter-specific interactions if using a certain hashtag. Since [https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/01/cr6uw/ 2020-01-13], see [https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/05/dhrdl/ a recent example with auto-linked hashtags]

Jamie has written about this more at https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/12/08/owning-hashtags/

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} uses hashtags with <code>p-category</code> microformats on articles since 2019-11-01. They are not currently linked to a tag aggregation page for similar posts.
* https://gregorlove.com/2019/11/oh-its-november/

Note in the markup the # is outside the p-category: <code><nowiki>#<span class="p-category">nablopomo</span></nowiki></code>

Sometime in late 2022 I started displaying hashtags similarly on [[note]]s. A recent example:

== FAQ ==
=== Autolinking hashtags ===
'''Where should hashtags in [[posts]] be auto-linked to?'''

Link them to a page on your site which aggregates posts tagged with that tag. It’s fine for this to just redirect to, for example, a google search of your site for that tag, but by always linking to a URL you control you can improve it/self-host it later.

== Blog Aggregators ==
There are some blog aggregators that show posts from other sites with a particular hashtag.

* Dev.to, e.g.
** https://dev.to/t/indieweb
** https://dev.to/t/webmentions, 

== Silo Examples ==
Silos that support (hash)tag aggregation on their own content.

=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] - [[photos]] (and [[videos]], but they don't play on tag aggregation pages, so effectively they're just images as well - poster-images from videos), e.g.:
* https://flickr.com/photos/tags/indieweb
* https://flickr.com/photos/tags/cortexiphan

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] - [[notes]] (with embedded media), e.g. 
* https://twitter.com/hashtag/indieweb
* https://twitter.com/hashtag/cortexiphan

=== Tumblr ===
[[Tumblr]] - Tumblr has an amazing display of heterogeneous post types in a single tag aggregation grid., e.g. Tubmlr's /tagged/ path shows a tag grid of the following post types: [[photo]], including animated GIFs, [[video]], [[note]], [[quote]],  post with embedded media (photo or video), at least partially displayed by default
* http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/indieweb
* http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/cortexiphan 

=== Previously ===
* [[Delicious]] was well known for tagged links

== Limitations ==
It appears that most platforms/silos limit hashtags to:
* _a-zA-Z0-9 characters
* Twitter, max length 139 (since Tweet length is 140)
** Twitter max promoted trend (hashtag) is 20.[https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170082?lang=en]
* most sites disallow hashtags that are just numbers (exception: [[Instagram]] allows them)
* some sites disallow hashtags that start with numbers (exception: [[Twitter]] near the end of 2009 started supporting hashtags that start with numbers per the increased frequency of use, e.g. [https://twitter.com/hashtag/2009resolution #2009resolution].)

== Brainstorming ==
=== person tag in plain text ===
* See: [[person-tag#Plain_text_authoring|person-tag plain text authoring]]

=== Regex ===
Check out Twitter's regex: https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text/blob/master/js/twitter-text.js#L135-L141

The following are a coarse approximations which will miss numerous international (non-English) hashtags.
* <code>/#[_a-zA-Z0-9]{1,139}/</code> is a regex that will match common hashtags per the [[#Limitations]] documented above, while liberally allowing numbers-only and numbers-starting hashtags, limited to hashtags that will fit on Twitter.
* <code>/#\w{1,139}/</code> is shorter.
* <code>/(^|\s)#([\w\:\.\/\-]){1,139}/</code> is what {{t}} is using in [[Falcon]].

=== more characters ===
{{t}} I have use-cases for more characters than the "usual" / Twitter’s regex. E.g. (from https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)
* ' ': "Needs Thought" (will use "__" for ' ' per [[Falcon#tags_with_spaces]] as noted below)
* '-': "css-ui"
* '/': "unknown/future spec"

=== hashtags for tags with spaces ===
Examples:
* Many [[WordPress]] blogs have categories with spaces in them.
* [https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html#ltcategorygtSubelementOfLtitemgt Feed Validator doc of category element] has <code><nowiki><category>Grateful Dead</category></nowiki></code> example
So having a way for hashtags to link to categories with spaces is desirable
* {{t}}: some thoughts here for now: [[Falcon#tags_with_spaces]]
** Leaning towards "__" (double underscore = space)


== IndieWeb-centric hashtags ==
Some hashtags commonly used by the IndieWeb community:
* #IndieWeb (naturally)
* #IndieWebCamp
* [[own_your_data#Hashtag|#ownyourdata]]
* [[newwwyear|#NewwwYear]]
* [[LetsFixThis|#LetsFixThis]]

== Notable IndieWeb related hashtags ==
* #[[DeleteFacebook]]
