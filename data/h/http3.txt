'''<dfn>http3</dfn>''' is the third version of [[HTTP]]. Unlike previous versions, it uses QUIC to multiplex connections over a UDP connection with the goal of reducing latency and avoiding congestion.

More information is available at [https://quicwg.org/ QUICWG] and the following standards:

* [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8999 RFC 8999 - Version-Independent Properties of QUIC]
* [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000 RFC 9000 - QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport]
* [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9001 RFC 9001 - Using TLS to Secure QUIC]
* [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002 RFC 9002 - QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control]

http3 [https://caniuse.com/http3 can be used] (but is not necessary enabled by default) by most modern browsers and some command line tools (e.g. [https://everything.curl.dev/http/http3 CURL])

http3 is used within and supported by networking infrastructure including iCloud Private Relay, Cloudflare, and Google.

Some notes:

* Libraries are available for both client and server support.

* On the client side, when a connection is established over https an `alt-svc` header (per [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc 7838 RFC 7838]; see also [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc mdn web docs]) can signal support for http3 (protocol "h3"), and the next connection can attempt to use http3.

* There are extensions which provide browsers with an indicator of the http transport in use:

** for Firefox: "HTTP Version Indicator"

** for Chrome: "HTTP Indicator"
