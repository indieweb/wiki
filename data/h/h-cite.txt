{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-cite h-cite]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up citations and references on web sites.

== IndieWeb Uses ==

There are several IndieWeb uses of h-cite:

* [[photo]] - information on an embedded photo. For example, if it has a different author than the post.
* [[reply-context]] - summary display of the original post that a reply/comment is [[in-reply-to]].
* [[comments]] - comments shown below a post that have been federated/syndicated in from their original [[reply]] permalink.
* [[like]] - context about the thing you liked, similar to a reply-context.
* [[repost]] - context about the thing you reposted, like what resonated with you and you wished to draw the reader's attention to through the repost.
* [[appearances]] — markup books, papers, films that listed in your appearances

=== Notes on markup and usability ===

* <kbd>[https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element blockquote]</kbd> and <kbd>[https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-cite-element cite]</kbd> tags - when quoting other blog posts, it's good to provide a fully marked up citation using h-cite and the <kbd>blockquote</kbd> and <kbd>cite</kbd> HTML tags.
* Citation user interface - it is suggested to provide an explicit <kbd>&lt;cite class="h-cite"&gt;</kbd> markup in an input text box at the bottom of blog posts. This allows others to easily copy and paste your content into their follow-up blog posts or responses.
** [[User:Tantek|Tantek]] provides such input boxes with citation markup to copy/paste in the footer of every [[article]] he publishes, e.g. [http://tantek.com/2013/287/b1/daily-routines-creatives-edited]

== FAQ ==
'''Q:''' When making a mentions stream, should I use h-cite around each entry?

'''A:''' If you are displaying the entire entry, then it does not need an h-cite. If you are citing a summary of the entry — e.g. name, URL, and dt-published — then an h-cite is appropriate.
