{{stub}}

'''<dfn>hashtag-cache</dfn>''' is, like [[nickname-cache]], a way indieweb sites store information about [[hashtags]] to improve the user experience of the site owner referring, mention, and/or linking to those tags.

== Use Cases ==

Many of the use cases are shared with [[nickname-cache]], but there are some specific ones.

=== Improved Tag Aggregation ===

[[Hashtags]] makes it easy to find posts around a common when people agree on a common taxonomy so that posts around a common subject can be gathered through [[tag aggregation]]. A hashtag-cache would make it possible to discover such common url-based hashtags so that one can set up them up with using [[u-category]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* None so far

* [[autosuggest]]
* [[nickname-cache]]
