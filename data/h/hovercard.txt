{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>hovercard</dfn>''' is a brief overview, usually including thumbnail, name, and description, that is shown in a rectangle overlapping in-context when you hover over something like a link, typically richer than a plain text tooltip.

== Why ==
You should show a hovercard over links to people and other things to provide your reader a bit more information about what you're linking to instead of making them have to click through to find out.

== How ==
No generally agreed upon mechanism yet, however [[link-preview]] publishing may be a good start.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
[http://www.kevinmarks.com/hwc2015-07-15.html notes from homebrew website club] have them, generated by [[noterlive]] as links to [[unmung]]'s hovercard service.

{{ancarda}}'s blog, https://markdain.net/ has hovercards for links to sites that contain an [[h-card]]. An example can be seen here: https://markdain.net/post/1 (hover over "Martijn van der Ven" near the bottom of the page). This feature currently only works for sites with an h-card on them. Sites that contain an [[h-entry]] that links to an h-card via an author markup aren't yet crawled. Non IndieWeb pages are also currently exempt from having hovercards. Developments can be followed here: https://github.com/ancarda/website/issues/24

=== capjamesg ===

{{capjamesg}} displays hovercards in his articles as of 2022-10-10.

Hovercards can contain:

* the title of a page
* page description
* an image from the page (i.e. the <meta> image)

Hovercards only appear if context about the page can be retrieved. Otherwise, a hovercard will not appear. At minimum, a hovercard must contain the title of a page.

Hovercards are triggered by hovering over a link for the content of an article. Links outside the main content in an article are not triggered by a hovercard.

Examples:

* https://jamesg.blog/2022/10/10/announcing-indieweb-utils-v0-3-1/

James published his hovercard code on GitHub:

* https://github.com/capjamesg/hovercard.js/

James wrote about his hovercard implementation in "[https://jamesg.blog/2022/10/12/hovercards/ Adding hovercards to my website]".

=== Icons to other profiles ===
It would be great if a hovercard implementation would parse multiple u-urls from people's h-cards and show icons for "other" (silo) profile URLs.

Real world example: {{t}}'s tantek.com has "other profiles" marked up as additional u-url values of the top level / representative h-card:  http://pin13.net/mf2/?url=http://tantek.com/ 

Fallback parsing:
* parse the [[rel=me]] links from the person's home page as well, and include those in the list of u-urls being used to detect other silo profile URLs.

Design/mockup needed for how this could/would look, hopefully not too [[NASCAR]]-like, e.g.:
* only show the small icon to a service (no text, or text only in the alt / title text of the icon img)
* only show an icon for the first URL to each service (e.g. if the h-card has two [[Twitter]] URLs, only use the first one)
* maybe limit to a certain number? like 10? or
* provide just one row of small icons like badges? (thus limit to however many will fit in that one row)

Perhaps try hacking something up using one of those free [[social media icon set]]s.

== Common Denominators ==

There are certain UI elements which are common to most implementations, as listed in Silo Examples below:
* Profile [[banner image]] - no current indieweb equivalent (maybe logo for h-feed, as [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.8 Atom says it is 2:1])
* avatar image - photo of representative h-card
* Full name - name of representative h-card
* tagline or bio  - note from representative h-card? summary from h-feed (per [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.12 atom:subtitle]) 
* links ( urls from h-card; may also be email, twitter handle - we don't express link text well)
* recent posts/actions - from h-entry's
* friends in common - this is hard; [[vouch]] gestures towards it but xfn parsing seems closer; we don't have a clear model of the viewer of the page.
* employer - job-title and org from h-card
* follow/subscribe buttons - these are not yet defined as [[webactions]]
* contact buttons - this may follow [[communication]]
* counts of posts made - not marked up currently

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] shows hovercards when you hover over a person's name or icon.

Content varies, but if you're friends it shows their recent events and friend adds

[[File:2015-08-31-facebook-hovercard-example-friend.png]]

if not friends it gives mutual friend lists and their job title,

[[File:2015-08-31-facebook-hovercard-example-mutual-friends.png]]

with no mutual friends you get more biographical info

[[File:2015-08-31-facebook-hovercard-example-disjoint.png]]


On Facebook, their "hovercards" (when you hover over hyperlinked full names) shows you
* cover photo
* avatar/logo
* full name
* number of followers
* if you're friends:
** Recent events
** new friendships (with 1 link)
* if you have mutual friends
** # of mutual friends that the reader and that link have in common
** links to a couple of them (Highest degree of common links I think)
** workplace
* with no mutual friends
** workplace
** education

=== Twitter ===
Twitter shows hovercards when you hover over linked @-names.
