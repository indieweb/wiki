'''<dfn>how</dfn>''' (or <dfn>how to</dfn> or <dfn>how do I</dfn>) is the second question after first asking [[why]]; why should I IndieWeb, or why should I adopt, use, do, or create any particular IndieWeb feature or [[building block]], once clear, leads to how can I IndieWeb, or how can I adopt, use, do, or create a particular IndieWeb thing.

== Useful questions ==
=== What problem are you trying to solve? ===
First think though exactly what problem you're actually trying to solve.

=== What is ______? ===
A reminder to search for examples of prior art before jumping in with both feet to solve an ill-defined or non-existent problem; also don't reinvent the wheel if you don't need to. See also [[Loqi#Wiki|What is XYZ?]]

=== Add Yourself ===
Don't forget to add your example/implementation to the wiki, so that others can see and learn from what you've done. It's also not a bad general life aphorism either...

=== Own Site First ===
If you're going to do something, implement it on your own site first.

=== Frame things in a positive light ===
Similar to the aphorism that you'll get more flies with honey, it helps to think about your work and creative brainstorming in a positive framing instead of a negative one. It's easier to create/build with positivity than negativity, which tends to tear things down.

=== How to Join the IndieWeb Wiki ===

[[wikifying#How_to_Join_the_IndieWeb_Wiki|Joining the IndieWeb Wiki]] and prioritizing what you want to work on can be helpful for creating focus for what you want to work on.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Adversarial Interoperability ===
Worth extracting some specific and broad "how" approaches from:
* 2019-06-07 boinboing: [https://boingboing.net/2019/06/07/lightsabers-for-trustbusting.html Adversarial interoperability: reviving an elegant weapon from a more civilized age to slay today's monopolies] has many tips / proven techniques for how to convert folks from using silos to using indieweb approaches, e.g. <blockquote>Once Facebook could give new users the ability to stay in touch with MySpace friends, then every message those Facebook users sent back to MySpace—with a footer advertising Facebook's superiority—became a recruiting tool for more Facebook users. MySpace served Facebook as a reservoir of conveniently organized potential users that could be easily reached with a compelling pitch about why they should switch.</blockquote> Now replace "Facebook" with "the IndieWeb" and "MySpace" with "Facebook", e.g.: <blockquote>Once [the IndieWeb] could give new users the ability to stay in touch with [Facebook] friends, then every message those [IndieWeb] users sent back to [Facebook]—with a footer advertising [the IndieWeb]'s superiority—became a recruiting tool for more [IndieWeb] users. [Facebook will serve the IndieWeb] as a reservoir of conveniently organized potential users that could be easily reached with a compelling pitch about why they should switch.</blockquote>[content replaced or inserted]. Redo with replacing [Facebook] with [Twitter] etc., and every other [[silo]].
