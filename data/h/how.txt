Adversarial interoperability: reviving an elegant weapon from a more civilized age to slay today's monopolies] has many tips / proven techniques for how to convert folks from using silos to using indieweb approaches, e.g. <blockquote>Once Facebook could give new users the ability to stay in touch with MySpace friends, then every message those Facebook users sent back to MySpace—with a footer advertising Facebook's superiority—became a recruiting tool for more Facebook users. MySpace served Facebook as a reservoir of conveniently organized potential users that could be easily reached with a compelling pitch about why they should switch.</blockquote> Now replace "Facebook" with "the IndieWeb" and "MySpace" with "Facebook", e.g.: <blockquote>Once [the IndieWeb] could give new users the ability to stay in touch with [Facebook] friends, then every message those [IndieWeb] users sent back to [Facebook]—with a footer advertising [the IndieWeb]'s superiority—became a recruiting tool for more [IndieWeb] users. [Facebook will serve the IndieWeb] as a reservoir of conveniently organized potential users that could be easily reached with a compelling pitch about why they should switch.</blockquote>[content replaced or inserted]. Redo with replacing [Facebook] with [Twitter] etc., and every other [[silo]].
