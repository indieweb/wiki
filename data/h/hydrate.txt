{{stub}}

'''<dfn>hydrate</dfn>''' is web developer [[jargon]] for the process of client-side [[JS]] taking over a DOM that was generated on the server, adding it to JS components, adding event handlers, â€¦ instead of generating components only on the client or entirely replacing those sent by the server. Due to complexity typically a process integrated with larger frameworks (example: [https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/hydration.html vue.js documentation]) that use the same code to render on the server and on the client.
