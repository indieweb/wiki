'''<dfn>https admin tax</dfn>''' is the additional amount of regular administrative work you or your web host must do to keep your [[https]] site running and available.

Note that this page is not saying https is something to avoid, just that you should be aware of the additional work required to configure and maintain the https certificate. 

Chrome [https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html plans to label all HTTP pages as non-secure] in an upcoming release, making the eventual move to https-only all but a requirement. For now, as of 2018-01, http websites are still visible and accessible in all browsers.

== Fragility ==
Due to this admin tax, making your website https-only makes it more fragile, as shown by numerous indieweb examples where people have forgotten or neglected to do the administrative work update their certificates, thus breaking their websites and making them inaccessible.

Search IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] for "certificate expired" or "cert expired" for examples of failure to pay this admin tax.

"But [[letsencrypt]] forces you to automate certificate renewal so there's no problem then!"
* Any automation can break, and thus needs monitoring and maintenance. Using [[letsencrypt]] helps reduce https admin tax, but does not eliminate it. You must still:
** make sure whatever cert renewal automation you setup keeps working,
** monitor it to know when it breaks, 
** repair it when it breaks, and 
** reimplement it when you move your site to another server
