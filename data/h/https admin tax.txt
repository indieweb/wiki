{{stub}}

'''<dfn>https admin tax</dfn>''' is the additional amount of regular administrative work you or your web host must do to keep your [[https]] site running and available even if you make no other changes to your site and want to just leave it alone.

If you run a website, you should still strongly consider adding [[https]] support for all the reasons in [[https#Why]]. This page is here to raise awareness of the additional work required to configure and maintain the https certificate, and real additional site outage risks, as documented by real world examples of failures.

== Fragility ==
Due to this admin tax, making your website https-only in particular makes it more fragile, as shown by numerous indieweb examples where people have forgotten or neglected to do the administrative work update their certificates, thus breaking their websites and making them inaccessible even over plain http since they hardcoded their websites to always redirect to the https-only version of pages. [[HSTS]] can add additional fragility here due to the time it makes you wait to make changes to the http(s) setup of your site including redirects.

Search IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] for "certificate expired" or "cert expired" for examples of failure to pay this admin tax.

"But [[letsencrypt]] forces you to automate certificate renewal so there's no problem then!"
* Any automation can break, and thus needs monitoring and maintenance. Using [[letsencrypt]] helps reduce https admin tax, but does not eliminate it. You must still:
** make sure whatever cert renewal automation you setup keeps working,
** monitor it to know when it breaks, 
** repair it when it breaks, and 
** reimplement it when you move your site to another server
