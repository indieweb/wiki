{{stub}}

'''<dfn>https admin tax</dfn>''' is the additional amount of nontrivial regular administrative work you or your web host service provider must do to keep your [[https]] site running and available as compared to http. Search IndieWeb [[discuss|chat]] for "certificate expired" or "cert expired" for examples of failure to pay this admin tax. Note that this page is not saying https is something to avoid, just that you should be aware of the additional work required to configure and maintain the https certificate. 

In 2018 using https is a requirement not a luxury for a website and shouldn't be considered a tax.
* http websites still work just fine in browsers (thus not "required" by any reasonable definition)
* it is a tax because it is extra work that is required to maintain an https website or else it breaks (see fragility below)

== Fragility ==
Due to this admin tax, making your website https-only makes it more fragile, as shown by numerous indieweb examples where people have forgotten or neglected to do the administrative work update their certificates, thus breaking their websites and making them inaccessible.

But [[letsencrypt]] forces you to automate certificate renewal so there's no problem then!
* Any automation can break, and thus needs monitoring and maintenance. Using [[letsencrypt]] helps reduce https admin tax, but does not eliminate it. You must still:
** make sure whatever cert renewal automation you setup keeps working,
** monitor it to know when it breaks, 
** repair it when it breaks, and 
** reimplement it when you move your site to another server
