{{stub}}

'''<dfn>https admin tax</dfn>''' is the additional amount of nontrivial regular administrative work you or your web host service provider must do to keep your [[https]] site running and available as compared to http. Search IndieWeb irc for "certificate expired" or "cert expired" for examples of failure to pay this admin tax.


In 2018 using https is a requirement not a luxury for a website and shouldn't be considered a tax.
