{{stub}}

'''<dfn>h-card as a service</dfn>''' (<nowiki>https://h-card-as-a-service.herokuapp.com</nowiki>) was a prototype web service replacement for wiki profile pages and [[chat-names]] built by {{veganstraightedge}}.

It was archived in May 2019 [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=h-card_as_a_service&diff=60817&oldid=49386]. As of 2022-12-03, the Github repository appears to no longer be available: https://github.com/veganstraightedge/h-card-as-a-service

== Features ==
* UI: a simple form with fields for commonly used properties (name, url, photo, etc) already used by several people on the wiki
* Lookup: h-card-as-a-service can be used as a single point of lookup for people’s h-card info. 
* Templating: It also shows the h-card markup on a person’s profile page which could be copy/pasted onto one’s website. 

== TODO ==
Also on https://github.com/veganstraightedge/h-card-as-a-service

* write README
* add button to edit form to re-fetch h-card
* add syntax highlighting for html h-card copy/pasta 
* turn on pg:backups on heroku 
* add person/delete?
* implement real `signed_in?` using indieauth
** auto-populate `URL` from indieauth when `signed_in?`
* port https://github.com/indieweb/representative-h-card-php to Ruby
** use that to parse bday from http://acegiak.net 
* auto-update h-cards (except '''note''' field) every night with a scheduled job
* get other URLs from rel=me (in addition to u-url)
* ...

== Feedback ==
* +1 on just "location". We don't have a lot of use for structured data (country/city) so better to leave it free-form. — {{aaronpk}}

* blank link with u-email if no email address entered. Should only include an email link if the field is entered? {{gRegor}}
** Fixed — {{veganstraightedge}}

== Brainstorming ==
* Right now we use <nowiki>{{nickname}}</nowiki> on the wiki a lot, so it'd be great if the wiki could pull from this site to be able to provide similar functionality. This will look like some sort of small mediawiki plugin. — {{aaronpk}}

* Please add usage examples in the pronoun section, I'm pronoun stupid and not 100% sure what each box means — [[User:Ignite.digitalignition.net|Ignite.digitalignition.net]]
