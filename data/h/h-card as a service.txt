* Lookup: h-card-as-a-service can be used as a single point of lookup for people’s h-card info. 
* Templating: It also shows the h-card markup on a person’s profile page which could be copy/pasted onto one’s website.

== Feedback ==
* +1 on just "location". We don't have a lot of use for structured data (country/city) so better to leave it free-form. — {{aaronpk}}

* blank link with u-email if no email address entered. Should only include an email link if the field is entered? {{gRegor}}
** Fixed — {{veganstraightedge}}

== Brainstorming ==
* Right now we use <nowiki>{{nickname}}</nowiki> on the wiki a lot, so it'd be great if the wiki could pull from this site to be able to provide similar functionality. This will look like some sort of small mediawiki plugin. — {{aaronpk}}
