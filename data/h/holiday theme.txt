A '''<dfn>holiday theme</dfn>''' is a temporary custom CSS or other change in a website typically meant to visually indicate the celebration of a holiday or special occasion.

== Why ==

A holiday theme is a way of celebrating the holidays that you care about. Similar to how people hang up special decorations for particular holidays, some like to decorate their digital home with a temporary theme.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Highlighting colors ===
Inspired by the CSS-based counter display at https://www.pinknews.co.uk/ one could implement highlighting colors for either personal branding or for holiday decoration. It has a clever little hack such that when you highlight across multiple paragraphs it gives each paragraph a different color for a rainbow effect.

[[File:Rainbow_colored_paragraph_highlighting.PNG|200px|frame|Screencapture from article showing multiple paragraphs which are highlighted in a rainbow of different colors.]]

It's done with a set of styles like: <nowiki>p:nth-child(6n+5)::selection { background-color: blue }  </nowiki>

Basically, for every <nowiki><p></nowiki> element in the main body of text it just cycles through 5 or 6 possible background colours, using the <nowiki>::selection</nowiki> pseudo selector (?) to only appear when highlighted and nth-child to target each paragraph differently.

Ideas:
* Pastel colors for Spring/Easter
* Red, white and blue for Fourth of July?
* Orange/black for [[Halloween]]?
* red/white for candy canes or Red/Green in December

This could also be used to spice up one's [[fragmentioner]] as well.
