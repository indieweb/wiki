{{stub}}

'''<dfn>h-x-app</dfn>''' is a proposed microformats vocabulary for marking up data about software applications.

There's a bunch of research into existing formats and potential properties over on [[store]]. See below for current, experimental usage.

In October 2021 {{snarfed}} [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2021-10-13#t1634169089002700 indicated], based on his [[indie map]] crawl of IndieWeb sites, that complete set of h-x-app names at the time was: [[Quill]], IndieAuth.com, [[Teacup]], redaktor, Switchboard, Taproot Notes, A WebMention Endpoint, unrelenting.technology Game logs, unrelenting.technology Crawl log, and [[Woodwind]] (defunct). Here are the complete indiemap h-x-app results: 121 pages, 25 canonical. (beware, 29MB!) https://snarfed.org/h-x-app.csv

Aaron also added <code>h-x-app</code> markup to the IndieWebCamp wiki with '''name''', '''logo/photo''' and '''url''' properties.

=== Consumers ===
==== Danielle McLean ====
{{00dani}} parses <code>h-x-app</code> markup in her authorization endpoint and uses the data to better present where she is logging in to. See [https://00dani.me/articles/4/lemoncurry-1-5-0-now-with-indieauth her post about it], with screenshots of her UI.

==== Aaron Parecki ====
{{aaronpk}} parses <code>h-x-app</code> (and <code>h-app</code>) markup in the [[p3k]] authorization endpoint to present a nicer prompt when logging in to applications.

==== Eddie Hinkle ====
{{eddiehinkle.com}} parses both <code>h-x-app</code> and <code>h-app</code> markup in the [[abode]] authorization endpoint to present a nicer prompt when logging in and authenticating applications.

[[File:abode-authorization-screen.png|420px]]

==== capjamesg ====

{{capjamesg}} published h-x-app markup with the name, logo, and url properties on the following resources that he has built and hosts:

* [https://webmention.jamesg.blog Webmention Endpoint]
* [https://micropub.jamesg.blog Micropub Endpoint]
* [https://microsub.jamesg.blog Microsub Endpoint]

{{capjamesg}} reads h-app and h-x-app markup in his IndieAuth endpoint during the authorization stage as per the specification. The name, logo, and url of an application found in h-app or h-x-app markup is presented to the user during authorization for additional context on the application to which they are subscribing.

== Service Support ==

=== indieauth.com ===
[[IndieAuth.com]] consumes <code>h-x-app</code> when displaying the authentication/authorization prompt in order to show the application's name and icon if available. If no markup is available, then only the client_id is displayed.

[[File:indieauth.com-prompt-showing-app-info.png]]

== Properties ==

h-x-app properties currently in use are:

* u-url: URL of the client.
* p-name: Name of the client.
* u-logo: An image representative of an application.
* p-summary: Provides a short description of the client, which may include its purpose (not part of the IndieAuth specification)
* p-author: Author of the client, optionally marked up as an embedded h-card

=== p-summary Discussion ===

A p-summary attribute could be displayed on an authorization page on an IndieAuth server. Some OAuth clients such as Twitter already allow applications to specify descriptions. Similar behavior would be useful in IndieAuth. A client could show a description of their tool on the IndieAuth serverâ€™s authorization page when a user is asked to approve acces to their tool.

p-summary has not been adopted by as many clients as the other proprieties.

== Brainstorming ==

* How is h-x-app different from h-product? The current attributes in use both overlap. I know the intent behind h-x-app is to convey information about applications. Is an "application" a product for IndieAuth use cases?
** Maybe h-x-app needs to be more clearly defined toward a /store use case in order to advance further in its development outside of being used for client introspection by IndieAuth providers.
