{{stub}}

'''<dfn>headless CMS</dfn>''' is a [[Content Management System]] that only handles the backend parts of a traditional CMS (storage, editing interface, APIs, ...), with the visitor-facing side handled by a different system. 

For an Indieweb site, a combination of file storage and a [[Micropub]] server that are used to create posts that are then rendered into a [[static site]] by a [[static site generator]] could be called a headless CMS.

== Examples ==

* [[Netlify CMS]] - edits content stored on Github, actual website is rendered by a [[static site generator]]
* [https://strapi.io/ Strapi] - "The most advanced open-source Content Management Framework to build powerful API with no effort."
* [https://getcockpit.com/ Cockpit] - "Simple content platform to manage any structured content. A self-hosted headless and api-driven CMS"
* [https://www.contentful.com/ Contentful] - A closed source headless cms as a service. Provides an editing interface and an api to retrieve content
