{{stub}}
Closest thing we currently have to an '''<dfn>h-feed validator</dfn>''' is the [https://monocle.p3k.io/preview Preview tool] in [[Monocle]], which will accept the URL of your [[h-feed]], parse it, and the display a minimally styled visual feed of what it found, which you can use to verify your feed name, and the entries in your feed with author information, article names if any, HTML or plain text content, and date-times published linked to entry permalinks.

There is a feature request to add h-feed validation to [[IndieWebify.me]]:
