'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-review h-review]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up [[review]] posts on web sites.

== Why ==
h-review is the simplest way to markup a review so that it has a chance of being consumed by readers, aggregators, etc.

== Using h-review ==
=== How to consume h-review ===
Use a [[microformats2]] parser as you do for [[posts]] in general.

You may treat an h-review similar to a [[comment]], however, you should at least be ready to handle an empty comment/summary/content field, and look for (and handle) at least the optional fields of:
* rating
* tags

=== Publishers ===

See and add to [[review#IndieWeb_Examples|review: IndieWeb Examples]] instead of here.

=== Consumers ===

* [[Breakfast_and_Coffee|Breakfast and Coffee]] accepts h-review documents via webmention. Upon sending a h-review to Breakfast and Coffee, the wiki will add your review to the aggregate review page that relates to the place you are reviewing. If no aggregate review exists, a new page will be created and the provided h-review will be at the top of the Review section in the new aggregate page.
