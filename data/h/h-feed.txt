https://indieweb.org/h-feed

'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed h-feed]</dfn>''' is a [[microformats2]] draft specification with a top level feed object to contain root class(h-*) objects, usually [[h-entry]] [[posts]] and optionally a common [[author]], name, and representative photo. It is functionally a [[DRY]]er replacement for RSS/Atom [[feed files]] and thus could supersede them.

== How ==
=== How to markup ===
Mark up your 
* your feed container with class="h-feed" (e.g. on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> or within a <code>section</code> or <code>div</code>)
* if there is a link to the page or alternatively the anchor for the feed container, then add class="u-url" on that hyperlink
** otherwise if you lack any top level links, you can optionally add a hidden link: <code><nowiki><a class="u-url" href="/"></a></nowiki></code>
** if the h-feed is a partial h-feed(for example, no content only name and url), add a link to the full h-feed with class="u-url u-uid"
* Optionally its name, often a top level <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with class="p-name"
* Optionally, add an [[h-card]] inside the h-feed with class="p-author". You can also, alternatively, have h-cards on each individual item in your h-feed, or a top-level h-card outside of the h-feed container.
* Optionally, and add class="u-photo" on the representative photo of your page (e.g. banner etc.). Consumers may imply/use the u-photo of the p-author h-card you marked up in the previous step
* Optionally, add <code>rel=prev</code> and <code>rel=next</code> links within your h-feed to provide support for [[pagination]]
* Optionally, if homepage does not contain your primary h-feed, a link to your h-feed from the homepage with rel="feed" to aid in discovering the feed or feeds.

Example markup below:

<pre>
<section class="h-feed">
  <h1 class="p-name"><a href="/feed" class="u-url">My h-feed</a></h1>
  <div class="h-entry">
    <a href="/entry/1" class="u-url p-name">Entry #1</a>
  </div>
  <div class="h-entry">
    <a href="/entry/2" class="u-url p-name">Entry #2</a>
  </div>
    ...
  <div class="h-entry">
    <a href="/entry/5" class="u-url p-name">Entry #5</a>
  </div>
  <a href="/next" rel="next">Next</a> &mdash; <a href="/previous" rel="prev">Previous</a>
  <a class="h-card u-url u-uid p-name">Jane S. Doe</a>
</section>
</pre>

=== How to test ===
Feeds marked up with h-feed should work in the same way as simple lists of h-entries. See [[feed#How_To_Test|How to Test Feeds]].

=== How to consume ===
See [[feed#How_To_Consume|How to Consume Feeds]]

== Why ==
So indie [[readers]] who subscribe to your site can display:
* a name (and icon) for your site/feed in a list
* [[authorship]] of the feed
* [[authorship]] of each entry in the feed
* multiple feeds from a page (less common)

Other use cases might include:
* Generate an Atom feed
** This seems like a legacy use-case, not sufficient to actually justify h-feed.
* Feed per channel of content - needs a name
** "I will have a feed per tag (channel) so I want to name them." - Sandeep Shetty in #indiewebcamp
** It appears there is some desire to create separate feeds for an indieweb site for separate subsets of content, and name them <em>explicitly</em> accordingly. This presents a need for a container object for the h-entry elements, where the container itself can have a name. This is a potential interesting use-case for an explicit 'h-feed'.
* An h-feed of h-events that can be subscribed to in a calendar program
* An h-feed of h-cards that could indicate a blogroll.
* An h-feed of h-cites could be used for a response feed.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members that support h-feed:

=== Tantek ===
[[User:Tantek|Tantek Çelik]] supports h-feed on his [http://tantek.com/ tantek.com] home page using an index.html template and [[Falcon]] since [http://tantek.com/2012/198/t1/added-microformats2-h-feed-h-entry 2012-07-16], at [[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]'s encouragement, to help with the indie [[reader]] he is building.

As retrieved on 2019-07-23, tantek.com has 3 h-feeds on his home page, which are nested inside his top-level h-card. The first does not have an explicit name and is a full feed of his posts, the second is a minimal feed of his recent articles, and the third is a feed of h-events indicate his speaking and events. The feed does not have pagination links.

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} supports h-feed on his site's main page as well as all other post lists including type specific pages (/note, /photo , etc) and monthly archives.  Feeds still need next/previous links, these will likely only be on a separate (primary) h-feed off the main page. The main page has had h-feed since March 2014 but was implemented to add h-feed to any post list type page in May 2015.

As retrieved 2019-07-23, the h-feed is nested inside a top-level h-card, has a name property, and the page supports pagination.

As retrieved 2019-07-23, the page has an h-feed with the properties of name, summary, and content(assume error as this encompasses the entire pages content). Feed has pagination.

=== Piper McCorkle ===
{{pmc}} supports h-feed for posts and notes at https://piperswe.me/posts and https://piperswe.me/notes, respectively

Feed has a name property.

=== Chris McLeod ===
{{mrk}} supports h-feed on his WordPress blog at https://mrkapowski.com/ by using the [[Autonomie]] theme.

The feed has a name and author h-card as properties. It previously had a photo property, but this was removed after running into issues syndicating [[photo]] posts.

=== Jamie Tanna ===

{{jamietanna}} has supported h-feed on all his feeds (homepage, per content type, for taxonomy items i.e. tags) since [https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/05/12/implementing-hfeed-making-content-discoverable/ 2019-05-12].

The feed has name and URL property.

== Implied Examples ==
Some sites have a collection of top level h-entry (or other) microformats, which are intended to imply an "h-feed" as a set.

* {{aaronpk}} — make a subsection with details
* {{addyourself}}

== Past Examples ==

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} has had an h-feed on eddiehinkle.com's [https://eddiehinkle.com homepage], [https://eddiehinkle.com/social/ social] page, as well as all of the sub-feed pages linked from social since 2017-03-10.

As retrieved, 2019-07-23, the homepage no longer has an h-feed. despite having a minimal representation of recent posts. The main feed appears to be at /all, has an author h-card property only. Social is no longer a valid link.

=== Will Norris ===
[[User:Willnorris.com|Will Norris]] supports h-feed on his [https://willnorris.com/ willnorris.com] home page since mid-2013 using WordPress and a modified version of [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 wordpress-uf2] (modifications to be sent upstream at soonish?)

As retrieved on 2019-07-23, the page is no longer running WordPress and no longer has an h-feed on the page.

== Consumers of H-Feed == 

This section covers consumers of h-feed. At the moment, this is primarily feed readers.

=== Readers === 

* [[Woodwind]]
* [[Shrewdness]]
* Readers implementing the [[Microsub]] spec also consume h-feed. See [[Microsub]] for a list.

=== Proxies ===

* [[Bridgy]]

=== Converters ===

* [[unmung]]
* [[granary]]

== Brainstorming ==

=== recommended practices ===

{{gwg}} reviewed community h-feed usage and noted that out of the ones listed on this page, the majority had a name property. many, but not all had an author property. A small number had a summary property or pagination. None of the ones surveyed had a photo property.

=== Feeds other than h-entry ===

While the definition of feed has traditionally been a number of h-entrys, other h-* objects have been used in feeds.

An h-feed of h-events has been used for an upcoming events list. An h-feed of h-cards has represented a followers list.

* {{gRegor}}: I have an h-feed for:
** h-event https://gregorlove.com/events/past
** h-cite https://gregorlove.com/responses/
** h-card https://gregorlove.com/following/ (implicit h-feed)

=== multiple h-feeds in the same page ===
# The first h-feed you find on the page (document order) is the h-feed ''of the page''
# Any additional h-feeds may be ignored by anyone processing the h-feed of the page
# If the publisher wants secondary h-feeds to be referenceable , they must put unique ID attributes on them
# Thus if consuming code wants to reference a secondary h-feed on a page it must do so with a url with the fragment ID of that secondary h-feed

=== partial feeds===
Partial (e.g. truncated) vs full h-feeds.

A lot of blogs have feeds with partial content, where the entries only have post names/titles, permalinks, and sometimes summaries but not full post content. This could be done for UX reasons where the reader is not subjected to a full long post but a quick list of shorter summaries.

If you do have a partial feed (e.g. on your home page), it is good (for indie [[reader]] consumption) to also have a separate full feed page.

The partial feed can use a <code>u-uid u-url</code> to link to the full feed page which could be discovered by a canonical h-feed discovery algorithm.
<pre>
    <div class="h-feed" id="partial_feed">
        <h1 class="p-name">
         <a class="u-url" href="#partial_feed">Partial Feed</a></h1>
        <a class="u-uid u-url" href="/feed.html">Full Feed</a>
        <ol>
            <li class="h-entry"><a href="permalink1">Article1 name</a></li>
            <li class="h-entry"><a href="permalink2">Article2 name</a></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</pre>

==== design freedom ====
The possibility of separate partial vs full feeds provides more design freedom for content publishers, since they can choose to have a full or partial (or no!) feed on their homepage and thus design accordingly.

<blockquote>acegiak: KartikPrabhu: my wife's site (which I'm helping her add microformats etc to) is a potential test for this because she's an artist and wants her landing page to be quite specific in appearance.</blockquote>

=== canonical feed autodiscovery ===
The assumption of a "canonical" feed may be the wrong framing.

Better to consider sites that share multiple feeds of information on their home page, and may have a "primary" feed among them. See "feed autodiscovery" for more.

=== feed autodiscovery ===
==== prior work ====
Feed readers discover the links to legacy RSS/Atom feed files automatically from HTML pages by parsing for links with <code>rel="alternate"</code> and  <code>type="application/rss+xml"</code> or <code>type="application/atom+xml"</code> respectively. 

When such links use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the page, this provides the potential for a nice UX where the user does not need to know about the 'plumbing' of feeds / feed files. 

Example from [http://adactio.com adactio.com] in [http://feedly.com Feedly]

[[File:autodiscovery-feed-example-adactio.jpg|500px|thumb|center|autodiscovery feed example from adactio.com]]

How can (possibly multiple) h-feed feeds be discovered similarly?

==== rel feed ====
Link to h-feed marked-up html pages from the home page using <code>rel="feed"</code> with <code>type="text/html"</code> and an optional <code>title="Feed Title"</code>. Also, suggested to have <code>rel="feed alternate"</code>. See also [[rel-feed]].

This would probably be unnecessary if the homepage itself was an h-feed.

2. http://blog.whatwg.org/feed-autodiscovery

==== url uid ====
Alternatively, if an h-feed has a u-url u-uid property that is not the URL of the current page itself, then that u-url u-uid URL can be treated as the canonical full feed.

==== Zegnat proposal 2018 ====
{{Zegnat}} proposed an algorithm for this here:
* https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-16#t1542370898681400


* Can I subscribe to tantek.com?
* What is tantek.com? tantek.com is Tantek Çelik (h-card)
* Is tantek.com a feed? No.
* Does tantek.com advertise a rel-feed URL? No.
* Does the main object on tantek.com (h-card) contain a feed? Yes!
* Are there multiple feeds? Yes
** Identify feeds using a uid if found, if not, a ID that can be used as a fragment
*** Return multiple feeds for the user to decide whcih to subscribe to
*** assume main feed.

==== Tantek example ====
On my tantek.com homepage, I have three h-feed elements
* unnamed
* Recent Articles
* Speaking & Events

I realized that this pattern makes sense from the perspective that the main/primary feed doesn't need a separate name, or a superfluous explicit name like "Main", thus an h-feed consumer could:
* treat the first unnamed h-feed as the primary h-feed of the page, and 
* lacking one, perhaps just treat the first h-feed as the primary h-feed.

== WordPress ==

=== WordPress classic hfeed ===
A large percentage of WordPress themes (how many? since when? #/% users?) use the classic [[hAtom]] <code>hfeed</code> class on every page, as opposed to only on pages with multiple <code>hentry</code> entries. Due to the popularity of WordPress, this is present on a large number of websites.

=== WordPress theme support ===
* {{aaronpk}} As of 2018-08, the state of WordPress theme support of Microformats is spotty: 
** aaronpk: <cite>I even subscribe to wordpress Atom feeds over microformats feeds when I follow people in my reader because the mf2 is always so inconsistent</cite> [https://chat.indieweb.org/wordpress/2018-07-29#t1532887939550200 source]
** However, when done properly, the Microformats feeds provide much richer data than other feed formats since they can convey a variety of [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|post types]], [[responses]] with rich [[reply-context]] (e.g. with [[h-cite]]), etc.
*** need URL example(s) of richer h-feed in a [[WordPress Theme]], more post types, reply-contexts, etc.
