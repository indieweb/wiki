https://indieweb.org/h-feed

'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed h-feed]</dfn>''' is a [[microformats2]] draft specification with a top level feed object to contain [[h-entry]] [[posts]] and optionally a common [[author]]. It is functionally a [[DRY]]er replacement for RSS/Atom [[feed files]] and thus could supersede them.

== How ==
=== How to markup ===
Mark up your 
* index your feed container with class="h-feed" (e.g. on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> or within a <code>section</code>)
* its top level <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with class="p-name"
** if it links to the index (itself) then class="u-url" on that hyperlink
** otherwise if you lack any top level links, this works: <code><nowiki><a class="u-url" href="/"></a></nowiki></code>
* markup the [[h-card]] you already have on your index page with class="p-author"
* and add class="u-photo" on the representative photo of your index page (e.g. banner etc.), or leave it out and let consumers imply/use the u-photo of the p-author h-card you marked up in the previous step
* add <code>rel=prev</code> and <code>rel=next</code> links within your h-feed to provide support for [[pagination]]

Example markup below:

<pre>
<section class="h-feed">
  <h2 class="p-name"><a href="/feed" class="u-url">My h-feed</a></h2>
  <div class="h-entry">
    <a href="/entry/1" class="u-url p-name">Entry #1</a>
  </div>
  <div class="h-entry">
    <a href="/entry/2" class="u-url p-name">Entry #2</a>
  </div>
    ...
  <div class="h-entry">
    <a href="/entry/5" class="u-url p-name">Entry #5</a>
  </div>
  <a href="/next" rel="next">Next</a> &mdash; <a href="/previous" rel="prev">Previous</a>
</section>
<a class="h-card u-url u-uid p-name">Jane S. Doe</a>
</pre>

=== How to test ===
Feeds marked up with h-feed should work in the same way as simple lists of h-entries. See [[feed#How_To_Test|How to Test Feeds]].

=== How to consume ===
See [[feed#How_To_Consume|How to Consume Feeds]]

== Why ==
So indie [[readers]] who subscribe to your site can display:
* a name (and icon) for your site/feed in a list
* [[authorship]] of the feed
* [[authorship]] of each entry in the feed
* multiple feeds from a page (less common)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members that support h-feed:

=== Tantek ===
[[User:Tantek|Tantek Çelik]] supports h-feed on his [http://tantek.com/ tantek.com] home page using an index.html template and [[Falcon]] since [http://tantek.com/2012/198/t1/added-microformats2-h-feed-h-entry 2012-07-16], at [[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]'s encouragement, to help with the indie [[reader]] he is building.

=== Shane Becker ===
[[User:veganstraightedge.com|Shane Becker]] supports h-feed on his [http://veganstraightedge.com/ veganstraightedge.com] home page using for his composite feed of posts and on each post-type specific feed ([http://veganstraightedge.com/notes /notes], [http://veganstraightedge.com/articles /articles], [http://veganstraightedge.com/bookmarks /bookmarks], [http://veganstraightedge.com/videos /videos], [http://veganstraightedge.com/notes /notes]) since [https://github.com/veganstraightedge/sbbme/commit/90a6d6eabeb3ff4d64177f163146f1e506dd0600#diff-75a266e0ac273be00ba708fb9e5ad5e1 2012-11-18] (private repo). He previously supported just hfeed on his feeds since [https://github.com/veganstraightedge/sbbme/commit/4d24ced47e2d15894326948c45983e75cd5e9f23#diff-bb387ef52f60f88effbf8d999def732aR1 2010-06-04] (private repo). 

=== Will Norris ===
[[User:Willnorris.com|Will Norris]] supports h-feed on his [https://willnorris.com/ willnorris.com] home page since mid-2013 using WordPress and a modified version of [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 wordpress-uf2] (modifications to be sent upstream at soonish?)

=== Kevin Marks ===
{{kevinmarks}} has had an h-feed on [http://kevinmarks.com kevinmarks.com] since 2013-12-10 and of course has one on [http://known.kevinmarks.com known.kevinmarks.com], like all [[known]] sites.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] supports h-feed on his [http://Waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] home page since 2014-01-21
* [http://waterpigs.co.uk/services/microformats-to-atom/ h-feed to atom gateway]

=== Jeena ===
[[User:Jeena.net|Jeena]] supports h-feed for his blog posts and notes on https://jeena.net since 2014-02-25

=== Tom Morris ===
[[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] supports h-feed for posts on [http://tommorris.org/ tommorris.org] since 2014-02-25.

=== Bear ===
{{bear}} supports h-feed for his blog posts at https://bear.im/bearlog since 2014-07-25. Feed discovery is lacking and needs to be added to his home page.

=== Pelle Wessman ===
{{voxpelli}} supports h-feed for his blog posts, archive, bookmarks and interactions at http://voxpelli.com/ since [https://github.com/voxpelli/voxpelli.github.com/commit/b12f4a9efadfd00a7276e151f2c3696f6b7a9279 2014-09-07]. For blog posts only partial content with titles only – for bookmarks and interactions full content.

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} supports h-feed for [[notes]] at http://gregorlove.com/notes/ since 2014-??-??.
* Since this feed is not on the homepage, the navigation link to the notes uses <code>rel="feed"</code> for [[feed discovery]].

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} supports h-feed on his site's main page as well as all other post lists including type specific pages (/note, /photo , etc) and monthly archives.  Feeds still need next/previous links, these will likely only be on a separate (primary) h-feed off the main page. The main page has had h-feed since March 2014 but was implemented to add h-feed to any post list type page in May 2015.

=== rhiaro ===
{{rhiaro}} has h-feed on homepage and all pages which are a collection of her own posts (eg. rhiaro.co.uk/tag/indieweb, rhiaro.co.uk/travel, rhiaro.co.uk/2015, rhiaro.co.uk/likes) since 2015-02-??.
* Plans to add rel=feed or something from homepage/side menu to discover different feeds.

=== Jonny Barnes ===
{{jonnybarnes}} supports h-feed for [[notes]] at https://jonnybarnes.uk/notes since ?

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} has had an h-feed on eddiehinkle.com's [https://eddiehinkle.com homepage], [https://eddiehinkle.com/social/ social] page, as well as all of the sub-feed pages linked from social since 2017-03-10.

=== Gokberk Yaltirakli ===
[[User:Gkbrk.com|Gokberk Yaltirakli]] has an h-feed on his [https://gkbrk.com/microblog microblog] page.

=== Vincent Pickering ===
{{Vincent}} supports h-feed for his blog posts at https://vincentp.me since 2019-01-01

=== Piper McCorkle ===
{{pmc}} supports h-feed for posts and notes at https://piperswe.me/posts and https://piperswe.me/notes, respectively

==Brainstorming==
=== multiple h-feeds in the same page ===
# The first h-feed you find on the page (document order) is the h-feed ''of the page''
# Any additional h-feeds may be ignored by anyone processing the h-feed of the page
# If the publisher wants secondary h-feeds to be referenceable , they must put unique ID attributes on them
# Thus if consuming code wants to reference a secondary h-feed on a page it must do so with a url with the fragment ID of that secondary h-feed

=== partial feeds===
Partial (e.g. truncated) vs full h-feeds.

A lot of blogs have feeds with partial content, where the entries only have post names/titles, permalinks, and sometimes summaries but not full post content. This could be done for UX reasons where the reader is not subjected to a full long post but a quick list of shorter summaries.

If you do have a partial feed (e.g. on your home page), it is good (for indie [[reader]] consumption) to also have a separate full feed page.

The partial feed can use a <code>u-uid u-url</code> to link to the full feed page which could be discovered by a canonical h-feed discovery algorithm.
<pre>
    <div class="h-feed" id="partial_feed">
        <h1 class="p-name">
         <a class="u-url" href="#partial_feed">Partial Feed</a></h1>
        <a class="u-uid u-url" href="/feed.html">Full Feed</a>
        <ol>
            <li class="h-entry"><a href="permalink1">Article1 name</a></li>
            <li class="h-entry"><a href="permalink2">Article2 name</a></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</pre>

==== design freedom ====
The possibility of separate partial vs full feeds provides more design freedom for content publishers, since they can choose to have a full or partial (or no!) feed on their homepage and thus design accordingly.

<blockquote>acegiak: KartikPrabhu: my wife's site (which I'm helping her add microformats etc to) is a potential test for this because she's an artist and wants her landing page to be quite specific in appearance.</blockquote>

=== canonical feed autodiscovery ===
The assumption of a "canonical" feed may be the wrong framing.

Better to consider sites that share multiple feeds of information on their home page, and may have a "primary" feed among them. See "feed autodiscovery" for more.

=== feed autodiscovery ===
==== prior work ====
Feed readers discover the links to legacy RSS/Atom feed files automatically from HTML pages by parsing for links with <code>rel="alternate"</code> and  <code>type="application/rss+xml"</code> or <code>type="application/atom+xml"</code> respectively. 

When such links use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the page, this provides the potential for a nice UX where the user does not need to know about the 'plumbing' of feeds / feed files. 

Example from [http://adactio.com adactio.com] in [http://feedly.com Feedly]

[[File:autodiscovery-feed-example-adactio.jpg|500px|thumb|center|autodiscovery feed example from adactio.com]]

How can (possibly multiple) h-feed feeds be discovered similarly?

==== rel feed ====
Link to h-feed marked-up html pages from the home page using <code>rel="feed"</code> with <code>type="text/html"</code> and an optional <code>title=""Feed Title"</code>. Also, suggested to have <code>rel="feed alternate"</code>. See also [[rel-feed]].

==== url uid ====
Alternatively, if an h-feed has a u-url u-uid property that is not the URL of the current page itself, then that u-url u-uid URL can be treated as the canonical full feed.

==== Zegnat proposal 2018 ====
{{Zegnat}} proposed an algorithm for this here:
* https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2018-11-16#t1542370898681400

To-do: extract algorithm and put here inline

==== Tantek example ====
On my tantek.com homepage, I have three h-feed elements
* unnamed
* Recent Articles
* Speaking & Events

I realized that this pattern makes sense from the perspective that the main/primary feed doesn't need a separate name, or a superfluous explicit name like "Main", thus an h-feed consumer could:
* treat the first unnamed h-feed as the primary h-feed of the page, and 
* lacking one, perhaps just treat the first h-feed as the primary h-feed.

== WordPress ==

=== WordPress classic hfeed ===
A large percentage of WordPress themes (how many? since when? #/% users?) use the classic [[hAtom]] <code>hfeed</code> class on every page, as opposed to only on pages with multiple <code>hentry</code> entries. Due to the popularity of WordPress, this is present on a large number of websites.

=== WordPress theme support ===
* {{aaronpk}} As of 2018-08, the state of WordPress theme support of Microformats is spotty: 
** aaronpk: <cite>I even subscribe to wordpress Atom feeds over microformats feeds when I follow people in my reader because the mf2 is always so inconsistent</cite> [https://chat.indieweb.org/wordpress/2018-07-29#t1532887939550200 source]
** However, when done properly, the Microformats feeds provide much richer data than other feed formats since they can convey a variety of [[posts#Kinds_of_Posts|post types]], [[responses]] with rich [[reply-context]] (e.g. with [[h-cite]]), etc.
*** need URL example(s) of richer h-feed in a [[WordPress Theme]], more post types, reply-contexts, etc.
