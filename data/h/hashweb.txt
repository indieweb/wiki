* Criticism: not actually practical for many web use-cases: https://chat.indieweb.org/microformats/2021-05-15/1621105675842000 <blockquote>I don’t want the page ID to change every time I fix a tpyo, and I also don’t want caching to completely break whenever a prev/next link or “12 hours ago” or whatever changes</blockquote> and thus not a "solution" for any kind of user-centric "decentralized web"
