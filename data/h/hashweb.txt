{{stub}}

'''<dfn>hashweb</dfn>''' is shorthand for content addressable web, a more directly meaningful term (instead of the overloaded “[[dweb]]”) for the set of technologies attempting to define identifiers (URLs) for content based purely on some hash of the content, such as [[IPFS]].

== Criticism ==
=== Impractical ===
The hashweb, in particular URLs based on content hashes, are not actually practical for many web use-cases: https://chat.indieweb.org/microformats/2021-05-15/1621105675842000 <blockquote>I don’t want the page ID to change every time I fix a tpyo, and I also don’t want caching to completely break whenever a prev/next link or “12 hours ago” or whatever changes</blockquote> and thus not a "solution" for any kind of user-centric "[[decentralized web]]"
