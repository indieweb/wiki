{{stub}}

'''<dfn>User-agent</dfn>''' is a common [[HTTP]] header that generally indicates the name, version, and a URL for the application making the request. 

As a simple anti-spam measure, many sites (especially Wordpress?) block requests from User-Agents like [[curl]] and python-requests, and it can be useful to specify your own to avoid these restrictions. 

If your application goes haywire and starts spamming them with too many requests, it also gives the receiver a clue where it's coming from so they can let you know!
