'''<dfn>[http://disqus.com/ Disqus]</dfn>''' is a [[comments]] hosting [[silo]].

You can use Disqus to create a comments embed on your site and blog [[posts]].

Though this does encourage your readers to sharecrop (on Disqus) their comments on your posts, it also provides them a single place to view the comments they've made across any/all sites that use Disqus for comments.

=== How to Export ===
(this section is a stub and needs help!)
__TOC__

How to export your comments from Disqus is actually two different questions:
# How to export comments written by you from Disqus (across all posts/sites you've commented with Disqus)
# How to export comments on your posts and site from Disqus (across all users who have commented on your stuff). Note: [https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2016-01-28/line/1454036098387 2016-01-28 request for this]

==== Exporting a blog's comments ====
Disqus provides the [https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472149 ability to export (XML) comment data from their system] for people using it as a plugin commenting system -- that is comments written on your posts/site (across all users who have commented on your site). The export data they provide is meant as a simple back-up rather than as something useful that would allow the comments to be re-imported into another site. It appears that those who use it on [[WordPress]] can opt to have the Disqus comments mirrored separately into their database so if they quit using it they still own the data.

==== Exporting your own comments ====
[https://disqus.com/home/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/exporting_my_own_comment_content_from_disqus/ As of 10/22/16] it still appears that there is no simple or direct method to export one's own comments. 


== IndieWeb Experience ==
No indieweb community members are currently using this on their own site(s).

IndieWeb community members that have tried this and their experience:
* {{aaronpk}}: "Facebook tends to get more comments [than Disqus] for me probably because everyone has an account and is always logged in"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819651]
* {{cweiske}}: "disqus doesn't work on my page"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819652]
* "I’m fed up with Disqus. It’s been useful, easy to plug on this blog, but it’s a mess for web performance, and I don’t own my data, so… bye bye. Webmention is now a great alternative, with more people implementing it, so let’s try to keep only that."

[[Bridgy]] uses Disqus to [https://www.brid.gy/about#disqus add incoming webmention support to Tumblr blogs]. It posts the webmentions as Disqus comments.

=== Displays ads on site to public but not owner ===
Via https://twitter.com/fdevillamil/status/394368809597149184, in short:
<blockquote>I'm getting reports that disqus shows ads to everyone but the admins/site-owner and uses some very shady tactics to do it.</blockquote>[https://twitter.com/zedshaw/status/394334044487307264]

'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Supercookie_.28other_uses.29 Supercookie]''' used to do so:
<blockquote>Confirmed, looks like Disqus is using a super cookie to track me even after clearing cookies and then avoids showing the ads to me.</blockquote>[https://twitter.com/zedshaw/status/394335690151849984]

== WordPress ==
The Disqus for [[WordPress]] plugin supports automatic syncing of comments between the Disqus system and the WordPress database. Which means there is no action required if Disqus is disabled for you to continue to have access to the comments people provided through it.
