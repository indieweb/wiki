[[Category:silo]]

'''<dfn>[https://del.icio.us/ Delicious]</dfn>''' is a [[bookmark]]s [[silo]] that was among the first to implement [[tags]], and user-tagging (AKA folksonomy), and present a UI of popular tags. [[Pinboard]] acquired delicious in 2017. Starting 2017-06-15 the site was put in read-only mode and delicious users were given the option to migrate to Pinboard or export their bookmarks.

== How to export your data ==
[[export|Export]] was an available feature for portions of the product's life, but not under others. In particular, during a long stretch of 2016-2017 under the Science, Inc. ownership, export was not available. Science, Inc. promised the feature would return, but it did not under their ownership.[http://boffosocko.com/2016/12/13/owning-my-old-delicious-bookmarks-sadly-not-today/ 1]

As a result of the inability of export, at least [https://github.com/szafranek/delicious-exporter one developer] wrote a script to allow a limited version of export.

Following the acquisition by [[Pinboard]], it was promised that the data export feature would be turned back on before the website was frozen on 2017-06-15 at which point no new bookmarks would be allowed to be created.

2017-06-11 The native export function on the site was finally re-enabled at https://del.icio.us/export.
