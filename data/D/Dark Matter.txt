__TOC__


== Dark Matter Platform ==

The longer term plan is build a collection of apps that work separately or together to provide a person with her #indieweb needs. The first app is '''Publisher'''. The second will likely be '''Reader''' or '''Contacts'''.

== Dark Matter Reader <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VERSION-0-red.svg" /> ==

We have plans to eventually build a feed reader too. It'll read [[RSS]]/[[Atom]], [[h-entry]], and popular [[silo]] [[snowflake]] APIs ([[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], [[Vimeo]], [[YouTube]], et al). It will be usable standalone or in conjuction with an instance of Dark Matter Publisher.


== Dark Matter Contacts <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VERSION-0-red.svg" /> ==

We have plans to eventually build a contact manager too. It'll be an adressbook of people, people/sites you follow, people you link to, places you geo-tag posts at, places you host events at, etc. It will be usable standalone or in conjuction with an instance of Dark Matter Publisher.




== Open Source ==

Our work is primarily focused on one repo right now:<br>
https://github.com/darkmatterapp/publisher-server-rails

All of Dark Matter is open source. It's very much a work in progress.
