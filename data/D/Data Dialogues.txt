'''<dfn>Data Dialogues</dfn>''' are three hour interactive and interdisciplinary workshops hosted by [[Meta Platforms]], focused on privacy challenges in rapidly evolving product areas, such as [[Threads]] and [[ActivityPub]]. 

A small group of practitioners from academia, nonprofits, and civil society are invited to discuss the challenges in developing a strategy that ensures products are designed to work for and protect everyone. 

Conversations are held under the Chatham House Rule.
