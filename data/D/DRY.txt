'''<dfn>DRY</dfn>''' is an acroynm for '''Don't Repeat Yourself'''. It describes a computing practice of reducing repetition. In data publishing, this means publishing one canonical version of information  — preferably visibly — rather than duplicating it inside the page (e.g. meta tags like [[OGP]]) or in separate [[side file]]s (e.g. [[RSS]]).
