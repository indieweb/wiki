'''<dfn>Doodle</dfn>''' is a lightweight scheduling webapp that lets you punch in your availability and figures it all out.

== IndieWeb Example ==
*2019-06-20 {{jgmac1106}} used a [https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2019/06/20/cho0sing-first-known-collective-meeting-knownchat series of events] that people could RSVP (a yes vote) for planning a meeting of the Known Open Collective

== Other Examples ==

* [https://framadate.org/ Framadate] is an open-source tool very similar to Doodle that may also be self-hosted

== Criticism ==
Doodle polls are heavily monetized through advertising. This leads to heavy webpages and requires people to give up data to choose to attend events.

* Criticism: Bad for any kind of community organizing. Doodle is better suited to corporate hierarchies where one person is in charge of determining the set of possible dates. For community organizing you want "anyone" to be able to suggest dates, adjust suggestions, etc. A community can also use more nuanced date preferences, with arbitrary commentary about the relative (in)convenience of specific dates. A wiki page / list of dates on a page/section are better suited than Doodle for all of these use-cases.
