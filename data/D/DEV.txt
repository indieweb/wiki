'''<dfn>[https://dev.to/ DEV]</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>dev.to</dfn>''' is a [[silo]]-based community of software developers that uses their platform for [[discovery]], publishing [[articles]] and networked learning about programming and development topics.

<blockquote>DEV is built on [https://forem.com/ Forem]: open source software designed to empower communities. Because our application is [https://github.com/forem open source], you can inspect every little detail of the code, or chip in yourself! Forem is available for anyone interested in creating similar communities in any niche or passion. Visit our meta Forem, forem.dev for more information.â€”[https://dev.to/about DEV about page]</blockquote>

== IndieWeb building blocks support ==

=== Syndication ===
Their blog platform uses [[Markdown]] and Liquid tags for composing posts so one can easily cut-and-paste content from their site for cross posting. The bottom of the post [[editor]] has a hexagonal icon with a circle inside that provides posting options including the ability to provide a [[rel-canonical]] link to indicate a syndication source.

[[File:Devto_canonical_link.PNG|thumb|alt=User interface screen capture of modal window that pops up when the hexagon is clicked. The Modal has a field for putting in the canonical URL of the original post as well as a potential series name once multiple posts in such a series exists.
]]


They provide a facility for cross-posting drafts of articles using [[RSS]] and rel-canonical links with details which can be found here: https://dev.to/settings/extensions
