'''<dfn>[https://dev.to/ DEV]</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>dev.to</dfn>''' is a [[silo]]-based community of software developers that uses their platform for [[discovery]], publishing [[articles]] and networked learning about programming and development topics.

<blockquote>DEV is built on [https://forem.com/ Forem]: open source software designed to empower communities. Because our application is [https://github.com/forem open source], you can inspect every little detail of the code, or chip in yourself! Forem is available for anyone interested in creating similar communities in any niche or passion.

== IndieWeb building blocks support ==

=== Syndication ===
Their blog platform uses [[Markdown]] and Liquid tags for composing posts so one can easily cut-and-paste content from their site for cross posting. The bottom of the post [[editor]] has a hexagonal icon with a circle inside that provides posting options including the ability to provide a [[rel-canonical]] link to indicate a syndication source.

They provide a facility for cross-posting drafts of articles using [[RSS]] and rel-canonical links with details which can be found here: https://dev.to/settings/extensions
