== Micropub Support ==

* 2016-02-21 {{aaronpk}} asked Dropshare if they would support Micropub https://aaronparecki.com/2016/02/21/7/
* 2016-02-22 Dropshare replied that they would look into it once "the RFC is passed" (presumably meaning once the spec reaches W3C Recommendation status) https://twitter.com/DropshareApps/status/701690450957230084
* 2017-05-24 {{aaronpk}} tweeted at Dropshare that Micropub is now a Recommendation, but did not get a response https://aaronparecki.com/2017/05/24/5/micropub
