'''<dfn>[https://datproject.org Dat]</dfn>''' is a protocol for transferring files peer-to-peer.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{kevinmarks}} has been experimenting with [[Fritter]] in early 2018
* {{jimpick}} did some experimentation at [[2017|IndieWeb Summit 2017]] which can be found in the [[2017/Demos#Jim_Pick|Demos section]].
* {{petermolnar}} runs a copy of his site over dat://petermolnar.net as an experiment since 2019-06-01

== How to run dat dat as a daemon on linux ==

This only works with static websites that use relative URLs to navigate.

    # get the latest binary release of dat cli
    cd /tmp
    wget https://github.com/datproject/dat/releases/download/v13.13.1/dat-13.13.1-linux-x64.zip
    unzip dat-13.13.1-linux-x64.zip
    cd dat-13.13.1-linux-x64
    # make the dat binary executable and copy it to a folder in $PATH
    chmod  0755 dat
    sudo cp dat ~/.local/bin
    # go to your website's root directory
    cd /var/www
    # create the dat information - this will be interactive
    dat create
    # create a file to tie your domain to your dat hash
    mkdir .well-known
    grep dat dat.json | sed -r 's/.*: "(.*)"/\1/' > .well-known/dat
    echo "TTL=3600" > .well-known/dat
    # open iptables for dat
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3282 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
    # switch to a screen session, because dat doesn't seem to have a real daemon 
    # mode yet
    screen -S dat
    # start sharing - this will import every file it finds in the directory
    # it's running from and will keep watching for changes
    dat share --port 3282 --watch --import
