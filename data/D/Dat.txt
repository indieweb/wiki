'''<dfn>[https://datproject.org Dat]</dfn>''' is a protocol for transferring files peer-to-peer.
Currently being superseded by the [[Hypercore]] protocol.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{kevinmarks}} has been experimenting with [[Fritter]] in early 2018
* {{jimpick}} did some experimentation at [[2017|IndieWeb Summit 2017]] which can be found in the [[2017/Demos#Jim_Pick|Demos section]].
* {{petermolnar}} runs a copy of his site over dat://petermolnar.net as an experiment since 2019-06-01
* [[User:Www.kickscondor.com|Kicks Condor]] has their site available on dat://kickscondor.com/ since â€¦.

== How to run dat dat as a daemon on linux ==

'''Important: as {{Zegnat}} pointed out, the commands below import everything, including hidden files, such as .htpasswd, .htaccess, will show source code of PHP files, and so on. It is very easy to leak secrets this way.'''

This only works with static websites that use relative URLs to navigate.

    # get the latest binary release of dat cli
    cd /tmp
    wget https://github.com/datproject/dat/releases/download/v13.13.1/dat-13.13.1-linux-x64.zip
    unzip dat-13.13.1-linux-x64.zip
    cd dat-13.13.1-linux-x64
    # make the dat binary executable and copy it to a folder in $PATH
    chmod  0755 dat
    sudo cp dat ~/.local/bin
    # go to your website's root directory
    cd /var/www
    # create the dat information - this will be interactive
    dat create
    # create a file to tie your domain to your dat hash
    mkdir .well-known
    grep dat dat.json | sed -r 's/.*: "(.*)"/\1/' > .well-known/dat
    echo "TTL=3600" > .well-known/dat
    # open iptables for dat
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3282 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
    # switch to a screen session, because dat doesn't seem to have a real daemon 
    # mode yet
    screen -S dat
    # start sharing - this will import every file it finds in the directory
    # it's running from and will keep watching for changes
    dat share --port 3282 --watch --import
