== IRC ==
DigitalOcean has an [[IRC]] channel on [https://freenode.net freenode]; #digitalocean

== Free DNS hosting ==

They offer free DNS hosting with a nice API, so it's possible to use it as dynamic DNS as well - once you detect a change in the local IP, you can alter the entry. The TTL is 900 seconds, which is not immediate, but tolerable.

They also seem to add [[domain privacy]] by default, also for free, to any domain, which is hosted (ns records are with digitalocean) with them.
