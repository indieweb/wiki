{{stub}}

'''<dfn>DOI</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for <i>Digital Object Identifier</i>, "a character string used to uniquely identify an object such as an electronic document[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier]", kind of like a URL with more bureaucracy.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== add yourself! ===

== Tools ==
* [[indiebookclub]] supports DOI when posting [[read]] posts.

== Criticism ==
=== URLs work fine ===
DOIs are unnecessary because URLs work fine, and in many ways are better than DOIs. See additional criticisms:
=== Organizational bottleneck ===
"Before Zenodo can issue a DOI for your …"[https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/] - say what? I have to get some ORG to issue URLs for me? No thanks.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-17/line/1400361447] Using a [[personal domain]] I can issue whatever/however many URLs I want without asking anyone's permission.
=== Use of minting a red flag ===
Anyone that talks about "Minting a …" is probably doing it wrong and trying to sell you some service for doing the so-called "minting".[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-17/line/1400361520]
=== Unobvious time waster ===
There's so much [[architecture astronomy]] talk in nearly any positive description of DOIs that you could easily waste hours of your time before it was clear it was a waste of time. Hence criticism documented here to hopefully help you shortcut such distraction.
== Silo Support ==
=== GitHub ===
As of ~ 2014-05, [[GitHub]] posted about [https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ Making Your Code Citable] using DOIs.
