== Advantages ==
* The UI is easy to navigate.
* Discord and its features are well documented (link?)

== Criticisms ==
* It's not self-hostable
* Although it contributes to OpenSource the product is not OpenSource
* Discord API and chat gateway is proprietary. This means that integration developers (i.e. people making bots) are beholden to implementing interfaces that work with Discord's specific API.
* Content stored on discord is stuck in a [[silo]], hidden from the rest of the web, and therefore not possible to index, search or archive.
* Discord has no built-in data export tool, and using the API for archiving data is against the TOS [https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Discord]

** "Discord remains mostly unpleasant for me to use but I'm learning to get better at it. It is very "noisy" as an interface for me. It's too similar to standing in the middle of Times Square or being in a room full of Slot Machines. But again, I'm working with it." [ @[Joe_Crawford]] February 4, 2025
