<blockquote>And spinning up a @discord server does not = community building. That’s one program out of many needed to engage with your community, yet it seems to be the default these days. I’m curious how many Slack orgs and Discord servers are you in currently? New blog post idea brewing.</blockquote>

=== Privacy Concerns ===
In response to a new global policy where “users may be required to engage in an age-verification process”, as announced: {{citation

}} concerns were raised about privacy. Especially as Discord was breached for thousands of photo ID scans just a few months prior.

Discord clarified their policy to alleviate some of the concerns by updating the blog post 2026-02-10 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20260211114128/https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification new archived]) and [[POSSE|cross-posting]] this to [[Twitter|X]]: {{citation

Adult users could avoid verifying, as well, due to concerns around data privacy, particularly if they don’t want to use an ID to verify their age. In October, one of Discord’s former third-party vendors suffered a data breach that exposed users’ age verification data, including images of government IDs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Discord remains mostly unpleasant for me to use but I'm learning to get better at it. It is very "noisy" as an interface for me. It's too similar to standing in the middle of Times Square or being in a room full of Slot Machines. But again, I'm working with it.</blockquote>

* It's not self-hostable
* Although it contributes to [[open source]] the product is not open source.
* Discord API and chat gateway is proprietary. This means that integration developers (i.e. people making bots) are beholden to implementing interfaces that work with Discord's specific API.
* Content stored on discord is stuck in a [[silo]], hidden from the rest of the web, and therefore not possible to index, search or archive.
* Discord has no built-in data export tool, and using the API for archiving data is against the TOS [https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Discord]
* Discord bans users who use third-party clients.
