'''<dfn>[https://duckduckgo.com/ DuckDuckGo]</dfn>''' is a search engine and also the name of a [[web browser]] which focuses on privacy; the search service supports a <kbd>!indieweb</kbd> hardcoded shortcut for searching the IndieWeb wiki, and is used for a personal site search feature by at least one IndieWeb site.

== Features ==
=== Shortcut searches ===
DuckDuckGo has [https://duckduckgo.com/bangs a shortcut feature called !Bang], which provides quick access to various other search services. This is especially useful when using DuckDuckGo as the default search engine of your browser, so you can use the address bar to search things.

The [https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=indieweb !indieweb] Bang can be used to search this wiki.

=== Off Switch for Bot-Generated Summaries ===
DuckDuckGo has settings to disable [[large language model]] summaries and a [https://noai.duckduckgo.com/ NoAI subdomain] that disables them by default. DDG advertised these options by running a poll in January 2026.
