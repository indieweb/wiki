'''<dfn>Dublin Core</dfn>''' (AKA '''Dublin Core Schema''' or just '''DC''') is an old set of vocabulary that was used in meta tags for terms like date, subject, author of a page that has few if any IndieWeb publishing examples beyond [[Known]] support, and has no known non-trivial consuming code or services for web pages. 

Dublin Core metadata uses a "DC:" prefix inside the meta tag name attribute.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Other than [[Known]] websites publishing Dublin Core meta tags, there are known no examples of #indieWeb sites prominently publishing or any that use or consume the vocabulary for any actual purpose.

== Other Examples ==
* [[Hypothesis]] has a tiny bit of obscure Dublin Core document identity vocabulary consuming support when parsing documents per https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-hypothesis-interacts-with-document-metadata/ <blockquote>When Hypothesis sees the combination of dc.identifier and dc.relation.ispartof it joins the values of the two tags to create a URL-independent identifier.</blockquote>

== Criticism ==
=== Too ambiguous ===
Dublin Core does not unambiguously identify important document aspects.
<blockquote>Use Dublin Core tags (e.g., DC.title) as a last resort - they work poorly for journal papers because Dublin Core doesn't have unambiguous fields for journal title, volume, issue, and page numbers.<cite><a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing">Google Scholar Inclusion Guidelines</a></cite></blockquote>

=== Lack of consuming code for HTML ===
* Citation for lack of HTML consuming of DC (note authority) https://twitter.com/paulwalk/status/1093110979406237697
** "(disclaimer: I manage DCMI): Good question :-)  There is evidence of DCMI Terms being used in Linked Data in other contexts, but not aware of research into consumption of DC in context of being embedded in webpages. [1/2]" [http://www.paulwalk.net @paulwalk] February 6, 2019

=== DRY violation ===
* Due to the paucity of consumers including Dublin Core meta tags typically duplicates visible information and thus violates the principles of [[DRY]].
