'''<dfn>Dublin Core</dfn>''' ('''Dublin Core Schema''') is a small set of vocabulary terms that can be used to describe digital resources (video, images, web pages, etc.), as well as physical resources such as books or CDs, and objects like artworks. Dublin Core metadata uses a "DC:" prefix.

== History ==
Dublin Core conceived at the 1995 invitational OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop. In the 2000s as people began to advocate for [[RDF]] Dublin Core became a popular vocabulary.

The initiative is governed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and any changes to Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
While [[Known]] websites include Dublin Core there are known no examples of #indieWeb sites using or consuming the vocabulary

== Other Examples ==
* [[Omeka]] includes Dublin Core in publishing
* [[Scalar]] includes Dublin Core in publishing
* [[Hypothesis]]  can use either a [[DOI]] or Dublin Core when parsing documents [https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-hypothesis-interacts-with-document-metadata/]

== Criticism ==
* Dublin Core does not identify important document elements.
** <blockquote>Use Dublin Core tags (e.g., DC.title) as a last resort - they work poorly for journal papers because Dublin Core doesn't have unambiguous fields for journal title, volume, issue, and page numbers.<cite><a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing">Google Scholar Inclusion Guidelines</a></cite></blockquote>
* Due to the paucity of consumers including Dublin Core violates the principles of [[DRY]].
