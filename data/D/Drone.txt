{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Drone</dfn>''' is a self-service [[continuous integration]] and [[continuous deploy]]  platform like [[Jenkins]], [[TravisCI]] and [[GitLab]].

As it is open source, this main advantage is that it can be self-hosted.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{Lohn.in}} uses a [[self-hosted]] instance of [[Gitea]] + [[Drone]] + [[Hugo]] for his [[personal domain]] (since 2021-08-07).
