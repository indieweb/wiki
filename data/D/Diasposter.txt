'''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/diasposter/ Diasposter]</dfn>''' is a [[POSSE]] plugin for [[WordPress]] that allows one to send posts from a self-hosted WordPress install to [[Diaspora]].

== Description ==

<blockquote>
“Diasposter posts to Diaspora whenever you hit the “Publish” button. It can import Disapora comments to your original WordPress posts. It even uploads your WordPress post images as native Diaspora photos.

Transform your WordPress website into a back-end for Diaspora. Create original posts using WordPress, but publish them to Diaspora. Synchronize with your Diaspora comments. Always have a portable copy (a running backup) of all your original content, plus its Diaspora discussion thread.”
