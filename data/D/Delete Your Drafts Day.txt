'''<dfn>Delete your drafts day''' is a day, when we encourage people to delete the posts in the drafts. It is celebrated on the 29th of February, so currently it only happens every four years. It was mentioned by Aaron on his blogpost [https://aaron.jorb.in/leap-day-is-delete-your-drafts-day/ Leap Day is Delete Your Drafts Day].
