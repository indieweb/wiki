'''<dfn>Dublin core</dfn>''' is what the "DC:" prefix refers to that you might see in invisible meta tags in some web pages, including in some indieweb sites (like default [[Known]] installs), yet there are no known practical consuming applications of such meta DC tags, and thus both no reason to publish them, and in addition reasons not to such as [[DRY]] violations.
