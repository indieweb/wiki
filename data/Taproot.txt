== Design Principles ==

In addition to the indiewebcamp [[principles]], these are some principles I have discovered through building taproot.

* '''Build software which feels safe, all other concerns''' (privacy, security, technically exciting) are secondary [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1181/] — this is based on personal experience through [[selfdogfood]]ing taproot
* '''Easy things should be easy, remove friction so hard things are only has hard as they need to be''' [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1168/]
* '''Use event listener patterns to build upon the same data in intelligent ways''' [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1100/]
* '''Build reusable, framework-agnostic components''' and release ''them'' to the public, not monolithic products.

Taproot was named on <time class="dt-published">2014-03-24</time>.

== IndieWeb Support ==
Taproot supports the following:
* All content is marked up using [[microformats2]] so parse at your leisure.
* Supports posting of [[notes]], [[articles]] and [[music]] — other post types are faked with HTML inside notes
* Sends [[pingbacks]] and [[webmention]]s to all the links on every post
* Receives webmentions and pingacks and displays them as [[comments]], [[likes]], [[reposts]] or [[mentions]]
** Hooked up to [[Bridgy]] to display silo interactions in the same place
* [[reply]] notes parse the URL they’re in-reply-to and display a [[reply-context]] if microformats are present
* Notes have [[webactions]] with twitter intent fallback if POSSEd to twitter
* ATOM fallback is provided for all [[feed]]s
* Notes and articles are [[POSSE]]d to [[twitter]] automatically and manually/indirectly to [[facebook]]
* Logging in using [[indieauth]] and [[distributed-indieauth]]
* New post UI is publicly viewable and can be used to create new posts on other people’s [[micropub]]-enabled sites

== Itches ==

Currently working on:
* Using Taproot every day to post content
* [[Shrewdness]]

Next up, in approximate order of priority:
* Publishing [[events]] and RSVPs, handling incoming RSVPs, figuring out invitations
* Publishing [[recipes]]
** Particularly I’m interested in presenting them in a way optimised for use in the kitchen from a laptop or tablet
* Audio posts, potentially with POSSE to [[Soundcloud]]
* Publishing likes and reposts
* DOM [[templating]] for all templates
* Extract more of the code behind my listeners and services into reusable open-source libraries

Done (latest first):
* Implemented anti-[[DDOS]] measures (tried client validation, ditched and went with expiring webmention endpoints)
* Publishing [[venues]] with reviews, inspired by [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]]
* Implemented a basic micropub endpoint, capable of creating notes
* Made it easier to edit note and article published datetimes and lists of syndication URLs
* Timezones now included in all datetimes in feeds and posts
* Showing mentions+mention counts on articles as well as notes, made templates and logic more reusable
* Composite [[feed]] on homepage instead of just notes
* Implemented distributed Indieauth and micropub, allowing people to use my new-note UI to create posts on their own site
* Integrated with [[Bridgy]] instead of manually shimming [[backfeed]]
* Added file upload control to note uploading UI
* Improved new note location UI with interactive map preview for manual adjustments
* Removed dedicated ATOM endpoints, replaced with generic mf2 to ATOM conversion endpoint
* Basic [[phone]] UI on homepage
** works nicely on desktop, needs improvement and [[Tropo]] involvement for good mobile UX
* Mobile-oriented [[homepage]] design as per [https://github.com/Taproot/design/blob/master/homepage-brainstorming.jpg previous brainstorming]
* Allowed notes to have names, which display as a small title at the top of the note. For shorter named articles which don’t quite fit into /articles, which is styled for long-form “serious” essays
* Improved check in/location note UI, location now shown on interactive [[Leaflet]] map before posting, can be corrected by dragging on map
* Added last-seen location+map, last 3 articles to homepage
* Added a homepage feed after feed reader research demonstrated need for URL -> latest posts
* Deploying new rewritten version
* Rewriting the whole thing to remove frameworkey nonsense code
** using silex as app library
** no DB — faking it with CSV indexes like the idiot I am (it’s actually surprisingly effective)
* Accepting webmentions as well as pingbacks
* Federated comments
* Post-by-[[email]]
* Major migration away from DB storage, toward flat files, with lots of codebase cleanup in the process
* Import of old posts from Diaspora [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes?tagged=diaspora&before=2012-08-23T17:35:19 see them here]
* Frontend js using Backbone and requirejs

== Structure ==

I got sick of all the complicated frameworkey nonsense which was accumulating in taproot. Symptoms:
* not immediately knowing where to look to change any one particular bit of functionality
* having to change things in different packages+deploy+update to do simple functionality changes
* too many layers of abstraction+indirection — specifically, mixing abstraction layers
* no longer fun to work on, simple additions take too much time
And as such I am rewriting taproot to be smaller and flatter and saner.

Documentation of the aforementioned frameworkey nonsense is retained for posterity at the bottom of the page.

=== Storage ===

==== Mentions ====

Mentions are stored separately from the content they refer to, for ease of editing and moderation. They’re stored with a flattened h-entry-like representation of them which can be easily used in various contexts.

The HTML and HTTP headers from cachable (i.e. public) URLs which are fetched (e.g. webmentioned or webmentioners) are stored in an archive, which also acts as a cache.

Incoming [[webmentions]] are processed by a mentions module, which does the following things:
* fetches and archives (using [https://github.com/Taproot/archive taproot/archive]) the webmention source URL
* resolves the target URL and gets it’s path
* parses microformats on the page, looks for the first h-entry. if found, it’s flattened, normalised and purified to avoid XSS attacks
* from rel values/u-* values in the h-entry, determine the primary mention relationship type, which is one of [[reply]], [[rsvp]], [[like]], [[repost]] or [[mention]] — mention is used as a fallback if no more specific one is given
* gives the mention an ID based on the source URI, target URI and current datetime
* stores the mention in a file containing the source, target, resolved target path and normalised h-entry
* indexes that file for querying later

Then, when looking for mentions of a particular URL (e.g. http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/1000/), the following steps are taken:
* Query the index for rows where the resolved path matches the path of the URL we’re looking for
* use the rows given to either determine mention type counts for the URL, or fetch the associated files and parse to get the h-entry data for displaying

==== Posts ====

Modules all store their data in flat files (usually YAML) which I index in CSV file indexes, read/written using PHP’s <code>fgetcsv</code> and <code>fputcsv</code> [http://php.net/manual/en/function.fgetcsv.php functions], which are surprisingly speedy.

For content which has an intrinsic name (like pieces of music, contacts or blog posts) I tend to use an ASCII-fied slug of the name for the ID, generated using [https://github.com/barnabywalters/php-helpers/blob/master/BarnabyWalters/Helpers/Helpers.php#L170 Helpers::toAscii]. Otherwise (for notes) I create a <= six-character ID from the newbase60 representation of epoch days + number of seconds into that day.

==== Schema ====

The data is all stored in a [[microformats]]-2 JSON variant structure which is substantially flatter than mf2 JSON — all properties are properties of the parent object, not a properties key, there is no “children” key and only plural properties map to arrays. I keep most of the semantics the same except on the occasions where I prefer a different term (tag over category) or want to aggregate the properties from what would be multiple different mf properties into one (e.g. combining geo, adr and venue into “location”).

* Originally I intended on using the [[activitystreams]] schema to store and represent all my content, the idea being that it would allow me to make listeners which could work seamlessly on all sorts of content types. In actuality, I have nowhere near as many content types as I anticipated, and want to treat each one very differently. In addition to this, I found some of the semantics within activitystreams irritating (e.g. displayName vs title, both horrible names) and the activity ~= object ambiguity confusing. Coupled with the fact that there is no activitystreams client, I decided to drop activitystreams as the basis for representing my data. --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 12:33, 14 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Previous, abandoned structure ===

Taproot has a highly modular structure. It is made up of an Application class, which handles event dispatching, simple dependency injection, routing and module loading. There are two types of modules — full modules, which expose URLs, and listeners, which listen to events dispatched within taproot.

Currently there are modules for Index, Notes, Articles, Contacts, Tunes, Tags and Mentions.

There are a large number of listeners which handle everything from authentication to [[POSSE]] and content transformation. Typically if I want to add a new piece of functionality I’ll do it in a listener, if I want to add a new content type I’ll create a new module.

== Notes ==

(out of date as of 2013-12)

The Notes module is the mainstay of my Taproot usage. It handles the creation and display of short [[note]]s — kinda like tweets, but with a potentially much larger scope through the excessive use of tagging.

As in most of Taproot, the notes module handles basic CRUDL of data, and various listeners do everything else, including converting markdown, interpreting hashtags, autolinking @names, syndication of content.

Posting a note looks like this:
