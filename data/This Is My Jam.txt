== POSSE to ==
This Is My Jam has an [[API]], however to date no one has used it to POSSE.

You can manually POSSE however, e.g. some folks who publish [[jam]] posts also POSSE them TIMJ. E.g.:

{{main|jam#IndieWeb_Examples}}

Example(s):
* Original jam post: http://tantek.com/2015/047/t7/mornings-look-for-me-trackish-tuesday

== Shutdown ==
This Is My Jam is expected to be archived on 2015-09-26 (according to their homepage) at which point the site will become read-only. It is unknown how long it will stay running in read-only mode.

* 2015-08-09 <cite>[http://thisismyjam.tumblr.com/post/126260430022/jam-preserves Jam Preserves]</cite> <blockquote>After nearly a year assessing many options, we’ve decided to stop operating This Is My Jam in its current form.</blockquote>
** Read-only: <blockquote>This Is My Jam will become a read-only time capsule in September. This means you won’t be able to post anymore, but you’ll be able to browse a new archive version of the site.</blockquote>
** Export: <blockquote>Your profile data (jams, loves, etc) will also be exportable in a few formats, including text lists; the [http://www.thisismyjam.com/developers read-only API] will stay online for developers who want to play; </blockquote>
** Open source: <blockquote>we’ll also be open sourcing as much code as we can [https://github.com/thisismyjam on Github].</blockquote>
** Problems with proprietary [[snowflake]] [[API]]s: <blockquote>keeping the jams flowing doesn’t just involve our own code; we interoperate with YouTube, SoundCloud, Twitter, Facebook, The Hype Machine, The Echo Nest, Amazon, and more. Over the last year, changes to those services have meant instead of working on Jam features, 100% of our time’s been spent updating years-old code libraries and hacking around deprecations just to keep the lights on. The trend is accelerating with more breaking/shutting off each month, soon exceeding our capacity to fix it. </blockquote>
** Licensing and geo barriers increased: <blockquote>more sophisticated licensing and geographic controls meant “sorry, this cannot be played here” messages became the norm rather than the exception.</blockquote>
