'''<dfn>Zero Registration</dfn>''' is a proposed name for the feature of [[IndieAuth]] that allows applications to interoperate with services using IndieAuth without having to register (with each other), unlike existing proprietary uses of [[OAuth]] clients and servers like apps having to register with [[Twitter]]/[[FB]] one at at time and wait for approval.
