'''<dfn>[https://zoom.us/ Zoom]</dfn>''' is a video conferencing service used during some [[IndieWebCamp]] and [[Homebrew Website Club]] events.

You do not need an account to join a Zoom link, and you ''can'' participate by their web interface, but the web interface will prompt you to download the app if you're not careful about navigating their user interface. Zoom has apps available for: iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows and Linux. https://zoom.us/download

''Consider [[Jitsi Meet]] for a WebRTC-based open source self-hostable alternative.''

== Tips for Remote Participation ==
Stay on mute until you are about to speak. That helps reduce background noise for everyone.

Use headphones. It's important to use headphones so that your microphone doesn't pick up audio from the other participants and feed it back into the call. Your phone's headphones are good enough, but a headset with a dedicated microphone, or headphones with built in microphone will work great as well.

If you will be using a camera to share your video, try to sit somewhere with a light source shining on your face, such as sitting facing a window. Avoid sitting facing away from a window because the camera pointing at the window will be backlit and it will be difficult to see your face.

== Tips for Hosts ==
Anyone with a Zoom link can join the meeting. By default, any participant in a meeting can share their video, screen, and audio. To prevent spam, trolling, and abuse:

* Use a new Zoom meeting ID for each event
* Designate one or two other co-hosts of the event, and give them co-host ability when they join
* All co-hosts should be familiar with how to kick people out of the video call quickly
* Avoid sharing the Zoom link directly on Twitter, instead link people to the events.indieweb.org page to get the Zoom link from there
* As host, consider turning off screen sharing initially and enabling only as necessary:
** In the host controls, click the arrow next to '''Share Screen''' and click '''Advanced Sharing Options'''
** Under '''Who can share?''' choose '''Only Host'''
** Close the window
