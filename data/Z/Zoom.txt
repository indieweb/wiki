== Tips for Remote Participation ==

Stay on mute until you are about to speak. That helps reduce background noise for everyone.

Use headphones. It's important to use headphones so that your microphone doesn't pick up audio from the other participants and feed it back into the call. Your phone's headphones are good enough, but a headset with a dedicated microphone, or headphones with built in microphone will work great as well.

If you will be using a camera to share your video, try to sit somewhere with a light source shining on your face, such as sitting facing a window. Avoid sitting facing away from a window because the camera pointing at the window will be backlit and it will be difficult to see your face.
