[https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131 WebmebtionDressing] ([http://bl.ocks.org/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131 demo]) is an "iframe ready" webmention display that lets you view [[Webmention|webmentions]] of a specific page on this wiki (for example [http://bl.ocks.org/thedod/raw/78b14341e39ca0d09131/#WebmentionDressing ''this'' page]). The code can also be configured to show webmentions of any other site using [[webmention.io]].

It can work on static sites (it's javascript) but not with javascript-disabled browers (for the same reason ;) ).

== Embeddind at Sites Using webmention.io ==
Simply edit ''SITE_ROOTS'' and ''DEMO_PATH'' at the top of [https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131#file-script-js script.js]  (as explained in the [https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131#file-readme-md README]).

You can then include an iframe with your own copy of WebmentionDressing (configured as explained above), and supply the current page's path as the URL's hash (e.g. ''#WebmentionDressing'' for [[WebmentionDressing|this page]] or ''#2014/Online'' for [[2014/Online]]).

== Theming ==

''To change the design (it doesn't have to be bootstrap), just edit the [https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html mustache] templates at the bottom of index.html''[https://gist.github.com/thedod/78b14341e39ca0d09131#file-readme-md]. Of course, if you don't want it to be bootstrap you'll also need to redesign the rest of the html :)

This was the original intention of WebmentionDressing: to create an easy platform for designers to try out various ideas of [[comments-presentation|comment presentation]].

=== Interactive Theming ===

An earlier version of the template exists as a codepen.io [[http://codepen.io/thedod/pen/MYYOVN/left pen]]. This enables realtime tweaking of templates. Remember to click "fork" before you begin so that you can save your changes :). You can either login to codepen via github, or simply save an "anonymous fork" (if you don't intend to maintain it later).

=== Contribs are Welcome ===

If you fork something nice (codepen, gist, or your own site), please let us know (e.g. post about it and webmention  [[WebmentionDressing|this page]] :)

== Deployment ==
