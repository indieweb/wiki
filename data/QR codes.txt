'''<dfn>QR codes</dfn>''' are 2D barcodes that have had a mixed success with usability, from nearly ignored (see [http://peoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com/ the Tumblr mocking this]), to partially successful ([[Path]] add friend UI), to invisibly useful ([[Snapchat]] add friend UI).

=== Opaqueness Encourages Domain Squatting ===
Since QR codes are opaque to the user in terms of what URL is being navigated to, there is more incentive for nefarious domain squatters to take over expired domains that QR codes point to, e.g.:

* 2015-06-19 <cite>[http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33200142 Heinz QR porn code too saucy for ketchup customer]</cite> <blockquote>Heinz has apologised after a QR code on a bottle of tomato ketchup directed people to a pornography website [â€¦] the registration of the URL had lapsed because the related promotion had ended. The site is no longer live. </blockquote><blockquote>Graham Cluley, an online security expert, said: "QR codes can point to anywhere on the web. The problem is that humans don't have a clue where they're going to be taken because their brain can't read a QR code, like they can a regular URL. <br/><br/>"It seems [Heinz] failed to renew their registration of the domain name, so it slipped out of their hands and was snatched up by an opportunistic porn site.</blockquote>
