{{stub}}

Typical use of the term '''<dfn>roadmap</dfn>''' does not refer to actual <em>roads, maps, or maps of roads</em> - instead, keep a personal priority ordered list of what you're specifically '''Working On''', and for unsorted or vague desires, add them to an unordered '''Itches''' list, on your User page or your project's page.

See: '''[[wikify]]''' to get started with documenting your own personal indieweb roadmap!
