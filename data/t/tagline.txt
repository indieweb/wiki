{{stub}}

<span class="p-summary">A '''<dfn>tagline</dfn>''' is a short phrase intended to uniquely identify a person, product, or organization, usually displayed visually on a web page shortly after the name.</span>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{benthatmustbeme}} - "SysAdmin, Developer, Technologist"
* {{benwerd}} - "Humanist technologist. Equality and adventures."
* {{gregorlove}} - "little g big R"
* [https://julieannenoying.com/ julie anne noying] - "annoying people since 1981"
* [https://kmikeym.com/ kmikeym] - "Community through Capitalism"
* [http://shevski.com/ skevski] - "I make things happen"
* ...

== Community Examples ==
* IndieWeb.org <blockquote>a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web".</blockquote> See [[#IndieWeb_Tagline|IndieWeb Tagline]] below for history and uptake in the wild.
* ...

== Silo Examples ==
* [[GooglePlus]] has a tagline field in the About page.
* [[WordPress]] has a specific tagline field for blogs that most often appears under the site title to be used this way
* [[Known]]'s subtitle field can be used this way
* [[Blogger]]'s description field for blogs can be used this way

== Differences from Bio ==
A [[bio]] is typically one or more grammatically complete sentences, whereas a tagline is typically a partial sentence or series of words. A tagline is not always descriptive of the thing, whereas a bio is intended to be descriptive. Additionally, bios are normally only associated with people, whereas taglines apply to companies or products as well.

== Marking up ==
Many blogs have a subtitle feed that functions as a tagline. In Atom these are marked up as [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.12 subtitle]
For [[h-feed]] using p-summary is suggested to mark this up. [[unmung]] translates atom subtitle to p-summary [http://www.unmung.com/feed?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fknown.kevinmarks.com%3F_t%3Drss&raw=on eg]

== IndieWeb Tagline ==
The indieweb.org (formerly indiewebcamp.com) website has had a tagline on the homepage since 2012.

Currently: <blockquote>The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web"</blockquote>

=== Similar Usage ===
Others have expressed the challenge / opportunity we (as a community) are facing / solving in similar ways, with a similar contrast:

* 2016-08-10 @anildash: <cite>[https://medium.com/@anildash/the-lost-infrastructure-of-social-media-d2b95662ccd3 The lost infrastructure of social media]</cite> <blockquote>"My hope is that those who are building tools today will see what’s come before and use it as inspiration to help give <strong>voice to people</strong> on the web in ways that are a bit more open-ended and a little less <strong>corporate-controlled</strong> than the platforms we have today."</blockquote> [see also [[lost infrastructure]]] This clear contrast of people vs. corporate is very much akin to the contrast in our tag line of <blockquote>The IndieWeb is a <strong>people-focused</strong> alternative to the "<strong>corporate web</strong>".</blockquote> <strong>emphasis added</strong> in both blockquotes.
