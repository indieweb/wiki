'''<dfn>test in production</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn>testing in production</dfn>) deploying code changes to a web site or service typically visible to the public as part of checking to see if the code changes function as expected, and is practiced by some IndieWeb [[creators]] especially with their own [[projects]] as a form of [[eating their own cooking]], often before publishing code changes to an open source repository.

== Why ==
Testing your code in production on your own site is one way to [[use what you make]] before sharing it with others to make sure it behaves as expected, and personally take the risk & responsibility for those changes rather than offloading those burdens to whoever might be using your open source project.

== Precautions ==
While testing your code in production can be a good part of [[using what you make]], security precautions should still be taken. Showing errors, warnings and notices usually reserved for dev environments can be a big security risk due to the fact that things like paths, usernames, secret keys, etc. might be inadvertently shown to anyone who cares to look. 

== How to ==
__TOC__
=== How to log errors ===
It‚Äôs not great [[UX]] to have confusing error messages intermingled with content.

Rather, you should log all such messages somewhere where only you can see them, or only show them in-page if you‚Äôre logged in as an admin.

In PHP, there are several ways to go about this.

* Setting <code>display_errors off</code> in your php.ini
* Within PHP: <code>ini_set('display_errors', 'off');</code>
* For a single line: <code>@codeWhichIsCausingErrors();</code>
* If you‚Äôre logged in as an admin: <pre>if ($user->isAdmin()) ini_set('display_errors', 'on');</pre>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has been testing [[CASSIS]] in production on his personal site tantek.com since creating it and continues to do so, in the hopes that any errors in code changes will be revealed on his personal site before they affect others.

== Corporate Examples ==
When corporations (e.g. [[silos]]) test in production, the results are often documented in unflattering ways unfortunately.

While "testing in production" may exercise some aspects, it is not a replacement for formal testing & QA methods.
