{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>top-level domain</dfn>''' ('''TLD''') is the last part of a domain name, such as <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, <code>.org</code>.  It should not be confused with the [[apex]] (e.g. the example.com in www.example.com).

== TLDs for web development ==

Many developers use a TLD for local domains for development. <code>.dev</code> is often used for this, but was registered in 2015 by Google [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/13/google_developer_gtld_domain_icann/]. In 2017, Google enabled HSTS for all <code>.dev</code> domains [https://ma.ttias.be/chrome-force-dev-domains-https-via-preloaded-hsts/] meaning it will not allow to work over [[HTTP]] any more.

[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606 RFC 2606] explicitly reserves <code>.test</code>, <code>.example</code>, and <code>.invalid</code> [https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2017-09-17/1505668270070000]. There is [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-let-localhost-be-localhost-06 a draft specification for <code>.localhost</code>].

== Domains ==
Alphabetically sorted domains (after the ccTLDs cluster).

=== ccTLDs ===
{{main|ccTLD}}
This is an abbreviated list of country code top level domains, for the full list of IndieWeb-related ccTLDs and IndieWeb or other experience / warnings, see: '''[[ccTLD]]'''

=== biz ===
.biz is a generic top level domain intended for use by businesses ("biz" is colloquial for business). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.biz for more details about .biz.

IndieWeb Examples:
* https://beesbuzz.biz/ — {{fluffy}}
* ...

=== ong ===
.ong is the French equivalent of .ngo, for non-governmental organizations, and is similar to .org in that respect except registrants must demonstrate non-governmental status (per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NGO_and_.ONG).

IndieWeb Related Examples:
* https://latl.ong/ — [[Meridian]] software & service (from the folks who brought you [[micro.blog]]
* ...

=== tech ===
.tech along with many of the other new similar TLD:s often have "premium" domains that are open for registration, but which have special "premium" pricing that can be above $10k/year at times.

When using a tool like [https://domainr.com/ Domainr] such domain names can often be suggested as short, easy to spell alternatives for terms that one searches for, but unless one spots that the domain is premium it can become a very expensive buy.

== Database of available TLDs ==

The IANA manages the authoritative list of TLDs on their website: [https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db the Root Zone Database]. Every domain has its own Delegation Record that is linked to and can be checked. If you would like to know [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-10-27/1509145554673000 who owns <code>.cat</code>] you can check [https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/cat.html its Delegation Record].
