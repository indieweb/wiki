{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>throwback</dfn>''' is a current [[post]] of content from some time ago, typically at least days, often years.

There are two potential reasons for posting old content. One would be for the purpose of archiving older content in a newer form, the other would be to share that content with others, such as old photos.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}}: I have manually posted some throwback photos. Typically these were photos that Facebook's [[on this day]] feature has brought up in my feed. I download the original photo from Facebook and post it on my site with a brief description, usually including the word "throwback". I link to the original photo post on Facebook and credit the person who took the photo. I've only done this with friend's photos who I know won't mind me reposting on my site.

=== David Shanske ===
{{gwg}} has been posting throwback photos for some time (since ????-??-??).

** the name of the post and photo caption explicitly notes "1980s"
** the content of the post notes "… dug into the archives for this polaroid", indicating both the creation some non-trivial time in the past, and in a different format (physical).

== Brainstorming == 
=== Design ===
{{gwg}} asked the question of whether throwback posts, old photos in particular, should have any particular special visual design elements.

=== Past Dating ===
{{gwg}} asked the question of whether or not a post should be created past-dated to the original content, and a separate post be created highlighting this currently. This would be consistent with content that was already on your site, that you would highlight in the present, and might be a way to encourage further create of pre-web content.

The use case for {{gwg}} is pre-web content. The example was 1980s era pictures.

This would be a kind of cross-media [[backfill]], from pre-web media to the web.

Compare also with features like [[on this day]] which are supported by silos like [[Timehop]] and in some sense are meant to encourage throw back type posts.

Other terms/phrases for this practice:
* {{gwg}} retro posting
* {{t}} retropost, retpost (akin to retcon, thought on Twitter, "#retpost" seems to be mostly typos for 'repost'). Both inspired from {{gwg}}’s suggestion.
* ...

{{t}} thoughts:
* Create a backdated post (retropost) with only the content that was created as of the point in time of the backdate, no subsequent annotations etc. E.g.
** when a photo was taken
** when handwritten notes were written in a paper log
