'''<dfn>twtxt</dfn>''' is a decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for hackers.

It is a CLI tool, as well as a format specification for self-hosted flat file based [[microblogging]].

Website: https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html.

You want to get some thoughts out on the internet in a convenient and
slick way while also following the gibberish of others? Instead of
signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform,
getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them
in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is
your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like
a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending
on which files you track. The format is simple, human readable, and
integrates well with UNIX command line utilities.
