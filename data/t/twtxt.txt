'''<dfn>twtxt</dfn>''' is a decentralised, minimalist microblogging service.

It is a CLI tool, as well as a format specification for self-hosted flat file based [[microblogging]]. Clients also exist in the form of a Web Application and there are
even free publically available services that you can use without installing a client.

Original website: https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/
Widely implemented extentions: https://dev.twtxt.net/

You want to get some thoughts out on the internet in a convenient and
slick way while also following the gibberish of others? Instead of
signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform,
getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them
in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is
your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like
a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending
on which files you track. The format is human readable, and
integrates well with UNIX command line utilities.

== Features ==

* A command-line interface thanks to click.
* Asynchronous HTTP requests thanks to asyncio/aiohttp and Python 3.
* Integrates with existing tools (scp, cut, echo, date, etc.) and your shell.
* Tweet using echo -e "`date -Im`\tHello world!" >> twtxt.txt!
* A specification with supporting tools

== Yarn.social ==

There is https://yarn.social/ (previously known as twtxt.net) which is compatible with normal twtxt feeds, but is an extended web-based setup, more resembling mastodon/pleroma, with support for multi-user servers, and writing posts with markdown (of course, just like mastodon, you can also be the solo user on your instance), and public viewing on the web, without needing to set up any clients.
