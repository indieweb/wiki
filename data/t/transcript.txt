A '''<dfn>transcript</dfn>''' is typically a word-for-word text version of the audio content in [[audio]] or [[video]] posts. 

Transcripts are often synced and embedded into videos and shown contemporaneously with the audio track in a process known as closed captioning.

== Why ==
Transcription greatly improves web [[accessibility]]. It also makes audio and video posts easier to find via [[search]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Marty McGuire ===
{{schmarty}} provided transcripts for [https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/ This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition] on his website. Some of the details for his process can be found at [https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/17/native-html5-captions-and-titles-for-audio-content-with-webvtt/ Native HTML5 captions and titles for audio content with WebVTT]

Clicking on one of the timestamps/text will take you to that portion of the video (aka [[media fragment]]).

=== TranscribeMe === 
[https://www.transcribeme.com/ TranscribeMe] is a paid service for transcriptions that indicates they can work for as low as $0.79/minute with turnaround times in under 24 hours. 

=== oTranscribe ===
[https://otranscribe.com/ oTranscribe] is "A free web app to take the pain out of transcribing recorded interviews." This is a more [[manual_until_it_hurts|manual]] process for creating transcripts, but has some useful interface to make the process a bit less painful. 
* Suggestion: Rougher/cheap services (like YouTube) with automated transcription might be used first and then this service could be utilized to clean those transcriptions up.
