A '''<dfn>transcript</dfn>''' is typically a word-for-word text version of the audio content in [[audio]] or [[video]] posts. 

Transcripts are often synced and embedded into videos and shown contemporaneously with the audio track in a process known as closed captioning.

== Why ==
Transcription greatly improves web [[accessibility]]. It also makes audio and video posts easier to find via [[search]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Marty McGuire ===
{{schmarty}} provided transcripts for [https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/ This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition] on his website. Some of the details for his process can be found at [https://martymcgui.re/2017/10/17/native-html5-captions-and-titles-for-audio-content-with-webvtt/ Native HTML5 captions and titles for audio content with WebVTT]

* To access time coded text versions of YouTube videos that have transcriptions, click on the "more" icon (the three dots next to the video's share and save icons) and click on "Transcript" and the page will open a sidebar with the text of the captions. Clicking on one of the timestamps/text will take you to that portion of the video (aka [[media fragment]]).
** It is possible to use the service [https://www.tunestotube.com/ TunesToTube] to upload audio (only) files to rely on YouTube's transcription service to transcribe podcast audio.

=== Rev ===

=== TranscribeMe === 
[https://www.transcribeme.com/ TranscribeMe] is a paid service for transcriptions that indicates they can work for as low as $0.79/minute with turnaround times in under 24 hours. 

=== oTranscribe ===
[https://otranscribe.com/ oTranscribe] is "A free web app to take the pain out of transcribing recorded interviews." This is a more [[manual_until_it_hurts|manual]] process for creating transcripts, but has some useful interface to make the process a bit less painful. 
* Suggestion: Rougher/cheap services (like YouTube) with automated transcription might be used first and then this service could be utilized to clean those transcriptions up.
