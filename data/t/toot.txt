'''<dfn>toot</dfn>''' was a humorous term for a [[note]] post in [[Mastodon]] that had its origins in a 2008 Twitter joke by Merlin Mann, suggested for adoption in Mastodon by Hbomberguy & officially adopted by Mastodon into its user experience in 2016, and finally removed in 2021.

Mastodon was originally called tootsuite.
