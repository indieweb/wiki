A '''<dfn>tags page</dfn>''' is a page that shows the [[tags]] in use by posts or other content on a specific site, or a way of browsing specific [[tag page]]s on a [[tag aggregation]] site, sometimes displayed as a tag cloud.
__TOC__

== Why ==
Having a tags page, especially one that displays their frequency of usage, can give you insights into which topics you are more interested in, enough to post more often about them.

A tags page that shows frequency of tags over time could help show you which subjects you are interested in more recently as opposed to subjects you used to be interested in.
