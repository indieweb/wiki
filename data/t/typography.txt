'''<dfn>Typography</dfn>''' is the art/science of making text attractive and readable. 

Among the most important considerations is the idea of managing the length of a line, in terms of the number of characters. A line of between 45 and 90 characters is widely considered more readable than both longer and shorter lines. The lines in this paragraph are not very readable on a desktop computer screen without adjusting the size of the typeface.

Additional considerations for typesetting include:
* Leading a.k.a. `line-height`, the space between lines of text
* Kerning a.k.a. `letter-spacing`, the space between individual characters
