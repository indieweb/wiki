Questions? Ask in our [[discussion]] channels!

Roughly ordered by importance / oldest first.

== Update How to Run an IndieWebCamp page/documentation ==
*We need an easier/simpler/shorter "how to run an IndieWebCamp" page / documentation https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps
* We need IndieWebCamp in a box prepared to send to new organizers https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamp_kit
** Things like "Hello my URL is" stickers, sticky notes for the grid, maybe masking tape. Or at least a list of things to order and have delivered to the venue
* Questions to ask registrants like: food prefs, childcare needs etc
* Decrease challenges like all the wiki pages, the nice pages at 2017.indieweb.org/ etc
**Keeping the choice of which ticketing system to use, for regional prefs. E.g. Tito eventbrite brownpapertickets or even Meetup
* Possible templates for typical camp pages and planning layout so it doesn't have to be reinvented
* Add more detailed steps to documentation on what types of information should be gathered via a ticketing system
* Add some specific tutorials regarding certain ticketing systems such as Tito in regards to best practices like copying an existing event as the beginning for a new event

== Improve [[Getting Started]] ==
In progress of updating [[Getting Started]] steps to:
* simplify steps (create subpages if necessary for longer explanations)
* reduce steps to only those that are required and have direct benefits
** i.e. are direct steps toward achieving [[IndieMark]] levels in various areas.
** provide an explicit "Why?" quick and easily understandable explanation of the benefits, the motivating reasons for taking this step. What problems are solved? What new capabilities do you get by taking this step.
* re-order steps in order of ease of implementation / dependency 
* move nice-to-haves, or simpler side options, to other pages.

I've updated [[Getting_Started#Connect|Connect]] and [[Getting_Started#Personal_Domain|Personal Domain]] accordingly (including subsuming short domain as a "bonus" subpart of personal domain) so far and will work on subsequent Getting Started steps accordingly. However, if you want to help with these updates, please go for it and edit accordingly! - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:06, 7 May 2013 (PDT)

Currently working on:
* ...

== Improve [[Why]] Explanation ==
* create subsections on [[why]] for frustration, fear, death
* provide good photo/summary page links (e.g. lightboxes of screenshots) for all corp site failures on [[site-deaths]] and [[why]] pages.
* copy each "why" citation for a silo to a Criticisms or Downtime section for that silo

== Tagboards ==
Create additional Tagboards (e.g. http://tagboard.com/indieweb ) for IndieWeb related things, and any tags used/mentioned by [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp] (or [https://twitter.com/indiewebcampuk @indiewebcampuk]) and link them to the respective wiki pages here.

{{jacky}}: The link to the tagboard is dead - do we need that? 11 Apr 2022

== Process Criticism ==
* If/when you see IndieWeb critical (or silo apologist) articles, add to: [[challenges#Citations_to_process]]

* Go through [[challenges#Citations_to_process]] and analyze the articles, extracting new [[FAQ]]s and specific challenges for the IndieWeb to overcome.

== Blog Update to Call For A Distributed Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

* Blog an update of the 2+ year old http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/ from an IndieWeb perspective, what IndieWeb technologies have solve the problems in the original post, status of the experimental tech the original post mentioned, etc.

* Include references to https://rhiaro.github.io/thesis/ since it is newer than Brewster's post and has lot broader coverage of projects, efforts etc.

Bonus, also integrate the points / proposals / projects mentioned in https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-if-we-build-the-internet-we-always-wanted into the post such that the post responds to both at the same time (there's a lot of overlap).

== Blog State of the Interoperable Decentralized Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

Follow-up to previous blog post and http://dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/decentralized_web.pdf (PDF, sorry, academic source) with case studies on some projects from that blog post and the 2016 [[Decentralized Web Summit]]

Consider also explicitly citing and following-up to: 
* https://metaverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/10/decentralized-web-pt-3-indieweb/

Document from most to least interoperably deployed decentralized web solutions.

Noting second to last anything mentioned in the MIT report that is deployed with real users but single-project [[monoculture]] with all the downsides of that, fragility etc.

Noting last anything mentioned in the MIT report that is either not deployed (e.g. academic / theory / hand-waving / hype), or experimentally deployed, but no real (even [[selfdogfood]]) users.

== Blog on Open Standards for the Decentralized Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

Follow-up to previous blog posts and {{aaronpk}}’s [[OSBridge]] [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/06/22/1/osbridge 2016 talk] on the topic, focusing first and mostly on:

* Well deployed interoperable web standards (10+ interop impls with real world daily users across systems)
** [[Webmention]]
** [[Micropub]]
** [[microformats2]] ([[h-entry]], [[h-card]], [[h-feed]], etc.)
* Emerging interoperable web standards (3+ interop impls with real world daily users across systems)
** [[WebSub]]
** Maybe [[LDN]]? Double-check actual software/systems/sites in use.
* Other standards being implemented (1+ impls, maybe interop, with real world daily users within systems)
** [[ActivityPub]] - e.g. on [[Mastodon]] etc.
* Monoculture standards - "standards" only implemented (often driven by) a single implementation, summarize such [[monoculture]] problems etc.
** [[Dat]]
** [[Ethereum]]
** [[IPFS]]

== IndieWeb Homepage Live Modules ==
* [[site-homepage#New_live_modules]]

== Archive sessions and chat logs ==
Refer to [[Etherpad#Archiving_IndieWebCamp_notes|Etherpad: Archiving IndieWebCamp notes]].
* [[2018/Nuremberg/Sessions]]
* [[2018/Düsseldorf/Demos]]
* [[2016/Berlin/Schedule]]
* [[2016/NYC/Demos]]

== Move YouTube archived content to archive.org ==

As we've moved to storing new sessions on archive.org, you can volunteer to move old sessions there that were recorded on YouTube...and maybe even watch them as well.

If each of us take a few when time permits...we can get through them easily.

Instructed parties can enquire in chat for the credentials for our archive.org account if you do not have them.

== Use What You Make ==
Goals: create an actual [[use what you make]] page separate from [[eat what you cook]], and replace general use of [[selfdogfood]] with [[use what you make]].

This needs multiple steps:

* ✅ extract the "use what you make" principle and supporting text/quotes from the [[eat what you cook]] metaphor and create a new page for [[use what you make]] rather than a redirect (may need to delete & recreate so it shows up as new), as the complement to [[make what you need]].
* analyze the [[selfdogfood]] page for content that would make sense to include or move to the new [[use what you make]] page, and turn [[selfdogfood]] into more of a metaphor-focused & historical page similar to [[scratch your own itch]]
* analyze which pages link to [[selfdogfood]], manually decide if they should reference and link to [[use what you make]] instead, and update those refs/links accordingly.
* ^ similarly, analyze which pages link to [[eat what you cook]], manually decide if they should reference and link to [[use what you make]] instead, and update those refs/links accordingly.
* ✅ after creating the new [[use what you make]] page, update [[principles]] to link directly to it in principle 4

== See Also ==
* [[wikify]]
* [[wiki]]

* add h-feed and WebSub to the columns of this table https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators#Web_feed_and_protocol_support, note which feed readers support either or both, and reach out to other OSS in that table requesting support (filing GH issues accordingly, and linking to them on their indieweb wiki pages!)
*  help with tracking down (with citations!) the YYYY-MM-DD dates for the items listed here that would be helpful! [[timeline#Needs_Dates_and_incorporation_above]]
* Write a descriptions of how indieweb [[building blocks]] have been tied together in various implementations to make a clearer more complete independent (decentralized) social web picture
* Look into developing a "mf2 upgrade" module for the "soil" WordPress Plugin https://github.com/roots/soil that would upgrade any Theme/Frontend microformat etc. markup to use mf2, re-using code and logic from https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-uf2
* Identify whole dead [[projects]] from https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=projects&diff=prev&oldid=41350 and move/archive them to another page accordingly, perhaps with archive-org links for their dead links
* write up something similar (as user-accessible and devoid of jargon) as https://macgenie.micro.blog/2018/04/10/a-guide-to.html adapted for IndieWeb, e.g. on "A Guide to the IndieWeb For People Who Have A Love/Hate Relationship With Twitter" obviously crediting the original as inspiration
* Create a page that lists / analyzes / shows IndieWeb Equivalents to https://medium.com/@anildash/the-missing-building-blocks-of-the-web-3fa490ae5cbc and is easily findable e.g. by searching for "Missing Building Blocks"

** "Why not just use your own domain for your to-do list and own your task. Here is my example: https://jgregorymcverry.com/my-to-do-list/ I send myself a webmention as updates. I have used Google Keep as well and just pin a “to-do, doing,  done” (http://jgregorymcverry.com/6265-2/)" [https://jgregorymcverry.com/ @jgmac1106] August 28, 2018
* split [[FAQ]] developer questions into their own [[developer FAQ]] (everything in FAQ should be written accessibly enough to answer anyone curious about IndieWeb, journalists, etc.)
* move Historical sections of pages to their own pages
* highlight best of breed screenshots for as many pages as possible near the tops of pages to immediately convey a product or spec or even concept

* Create an issue on Coralproject / talk https://github.com/coralproject/talk/issues asking to "Support Micropub to keep a copy of your comments on your own blog", noting the use-case / real-world example that there are Coral users that created their own Tumblr to just to manually keep a copy of their comments!
* write-up a "debunking" [[misconceptions]] entry for "No IndieWeb is not just people who program their own websites" per https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/100548246348444630
** "@KevinMarks @cwebber @aaronpk I'm sorry but indieweb doesn't count, you're programming your own websites, you're not the general population. That method is not accessible for most people on here." [https://mastodon.social/@Gargron @Gargron] August 14, 2018
* Document when/how to setup initial yyyy.indieweb(.)org/cityname page as part of [[IndieWebCamp_Organizing#Before]]
* Document when/how to connect up tito registration to yyyy.indieweb(.)org/cityname page as part of [[IndieWebCamp_Organizing#Before]], and be sure to uncomment / show Indie RSVPs!
* [[Category:building-blocks]] needs clean-up, some sort of IA/organization at a minimum clustering of similar "levels" of building blocks for easier chunking / understanding, and most of all, a set of diagrams illustrating how they interrelate
* do an iteration of updating [[IndieMark]] per recent tweet about it: https://twitter.com/eldelacajita/status/1091036825102307328
** "I found their IndieMark very interesting and useful for understanding the "how" part: https://indieweb.org/IndieMark<br><br>It "a set of metrics for measuring the indieweb-ness of a site, and a step-by-step approach to incrementally adopting indieweb features on your site"." [http://la-cajita.es @eldelacajita] January 31, 2019
* submit patches to add microformats2 support to the HTML output from [https://www.mhonarc.org/ MHonArc]
* ^^^ start here: https://github.com/Conservatory/MHonArc/blob/master/lib/mhamain.pl
* Good example of a series of diagrams to explain the progression of a technology, could be useful to do an IndieWeb building blocks version: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/
* fix the [[Main_Page|home page]] markup/styling in [[Template:Main_Page.css]] to be properly responsive for mobile widths so as to NOT overlap text (e.g. Discuss Events currently overlap the logo in mobile browsers, or narrow window on desktop), and to *not* use "position:absolute" on the nav UL as a horrible hack to "pull it up" to the top of the page.
* Incrementally update [[Getting Started on WordPress]] for accuracy and user-friendliness, see Chris Aldrich's work in progress on a rewrite: [[User:Boffosocko.com/wordpress-draft]] and feel free to merge from there into the current page.
* Simplify [[Category:building-blocks]] into a section with shortest possible list of IndieWeb Building Blocks necessary for interop, including using clustering to make fewer total blocks.
* add <code><nowiki>[[Category:Demos]]</nowiki></code> to past camp demo pages for inclusion to https://indieweb.org/Demos
** {{chrisaldrich}} added a bunch in 2020-07 using search, but likely didn't get them all (yet)
* garden this: [https://indieweb.org/Special:WhatLinksHere/selfdogfood Pages that link to "selfdogfood"] and instead how to contextually link to https://indieweb.org/eat_what_you_cook
* The demos from IWC Austin 2020 need to be extracted from chat logs and documented on [https://indieweb.org/2020/Austin/Demos 2020/Austin/Demos]
* stub a [[rude FAQ]] page based on the general idea as described in https://scottberkun.com/2007/how-to-write-a-rude-qa/ with answers to "but it costs money to have a domain" and "but what’s the business model"
** "but it costs money to have a domain" is concern-trolling. It's a nonsense isolated argument when everyone making that argument has spent 100x on their hardware (and annual cell service!) that they are using to make the argument. also until we have cities/states/countries providing UBS like free public water/toilets to housing & healthcare and eventually wifi & domains, if you make something "free" to users then you turn them into the exploited product. also everything costs money and if it doesn't, then someone else is paying on your behalf, and very likely getting something out of it that benefits them in some way, e.g. ads, with the exception of something like UBS which requires political changes.
** "but what’s the business model": Nope, no [[business model]] here, please go find something else to exploit you capitalist.
* split [[reacji]] and [[reacjis]] into two separate pages similar to [[like]] and [[likes]]
* Make a new [[identity loss]] page from [[why#Identity_loss]] and leave a summary in place there.
* Fix mobile display issues on the home page, see screnshot: https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2021-12-18#t1639789551480000
** "Also the homepage top bar displays poorly on mobile" [http://tracydurnell.com @tracydurnell[d]] December 18, 2021
* Create a [[brainstorming]] page describing what it is, and how to create a Brainstorming section as part of [[wikifying]]
* need to split-up and re-organize any specific content from [[blockchain]] into [[Bitcoin]] or [[cryptocurrency]] (possibly [[NFT]] or just as a subsection), and [[web3]] (and maybe a few others?), creating new articles instead of redirects accordingly (please with IndieWeb-relevant [[definition]]s), so that all the edits don't go to only a small # of negative articles.
* Check past few weeks of [[newsletter]]s for heavily edited wiki pages to see if they’ve perhaps grown to big and could have large sections split into separate pages.
* Create a new page for [[aggregator]] that is a much broader description than [[reader]] or [[feed reader]] and includes things like [[IndieNews]] and other uses for the word, and redirect [[aggregators]], [[aggregate]], and [[aggregation]] to [[aggregator]]
* Update [[2019/Düsseldorf/Demos]] with actual demo descriptions from the IRC chat log link in the page
* split [[why post]] into its own page, it’s worth its own definition and expansion
* update [[Main_Page]] to not refer to Selfdogfood and instead say to [[use what you make]] or simpler: use the web (instead of email)
* Review whether [[long-troll]] should be on the wiki, part of or redirected to something else, or deleted as unrelated to the IndieWeb (may have been an accidental/unintended page creation from chat)
* Improve [[Getting Started]] to be at least as friendly for newcomers as: https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-started-use-mastodon/
* Once they've been uploaded, figure out appropriate pages for using the images/cards from [https://boffosocko.com/2020/12/01/indieweb-advertising-cards/ IndieWeb Inspirational Cards] as "hero" images at the top
** Uploaded: the Wiki links for the images can be found just at/below: https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2022-12-20#t1671578123280600
* Should we create a page about [[BDFL]]s and/or [[Messianic thinking]] as described in https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/10755-Warning-signs-with-social-media-platforms#10755_h3_1_Messianic-thinking as a general warning to both avoid projects/efforts with such personalities, and to avoid becoming such a personality yourself?
* need new page: [[JS framework]] (or [[JavaScript framework]], or some other name variant better than these) that collects the JS-specific framework information/links across the wiki, which you can find by searching for "JS framework" or "Javascript framework", and then use it as a main|JS_framework link at the top of this section: [[framework#JS]]
* Watch the video of [[2022/Düsseldorf/Demos]] and take notes in that wiki page on who demonstrated and what did they demonstrated, similar to [[2021/Düsseldorf/Demos]].
* Archive etherpads from [[2022/Düsseldorf/Schedule]] into session pages on the wiki
