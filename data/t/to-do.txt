Questions? Ask in our [[discussion]] channels!

Roughly ordered by importance / oldest first.

== Simplify and update How to Run an IndieWebCamp docs ==
*We need an easier/simpler/shorter "how to run an IndieWebCamp" page / documentation:
** '''[[IndieWebCamps]]'''
** many specific steps for this are documented on the page/section: 
*** [[IndieWebCamp_Organizing#See_Also]]
* We need IndieWebCamp in a box prepared to send to new organizers https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamp_kit
** Things like "Hello my URL is" stickers, sticky notes for the grid, maybe masking tape. Or at least a list of things to order and have delivered to the venue
* Questions to ask registrants like: food prefs, [[accessibility]] needs, childcare needs etc
* Decrease challenges like all the wiki pages, the nice pages at 2017.indieweb.org/ etc
**Keeping the choice of which ticketing system to use, for regional prefs. E.g. Tito eventbrite brownpapertickets or even Meetup
* Possible templates for typical camp pages and planning layout so it doesn't have to be reinvented
* Add more detailed steps to documentation on what types of information should be gathered via a ticketing system
* Add some specific tutorials regarding certain ticketing systems such as Tito in regards to best practices like copying an existing event as the beginning for a new event

== Improve [[Getting Started]] ==
In progress of updating [[Getting Started]] steps to:
* simplify steps (create subpages if necessary for longer explanations)
* reduce steps to only those that are required and have direct benefits
** i.e. are direct steps toward achieving [[IndieMark]] levels in various areas.
** provide an explicit "Why?" quick and easily understandable explanation of the benefits, the motivating reasons for taking this step. What problems are solved? What new capabilities do you get by taking this step.
* re-order steps in order of ease of implementation / dependency 
* move nice-to-haves, or simpler side options, to other pages.

I've updated [[Getting_Started#Connect|Connect]] and [[Getting_Started#Personal_Domain|Personal Domain]] accordingly (including subsuming short domain as a "bonus" subpart of personal domain) so far and will work on subsequent Getting Started steps accordingly. However, if you want to help with these updates, please go for it and edit accordingly! - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:06, 7 May 2013 (PDT)

Currently working on:
* ...

== Improve [[Why]] Explanation ==
* create subsections on [[why]] for frustration, fear, death
* provide good photo/summary page links (e.g. lightboxes of screenshots) for all corp site failures on [[site-deaths]] and [[why]] pages.
* copy each "why" citation for a silo to a Criticisms or Downtime section for that silo

== Process Criticism ==
* If/when you see IndieWeb critical (or silo apologist) articles, add to: [[challenges#Citations_to_process]]

* Go through [[challenges#Citations_to_process]] and analyze the articles, extracting new [[FAQ]]s and specific challenges for the IndieWeb to overcome.

== Blog Update to Call For A Distributed Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

* Blog an update of the 2+ year old http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/ from an IndieWeb perspective, what IndieWeb technologies have solve the problems in the original post, status of the experimental tech the original post mentioned, etc.

* Include references to https://rhiaro.github.io/thesis/ since it is newer than Brewster's post and has lot broader coverage of projects, efforts etc.

Bonus, also integrate the points / proposals / projects mentioned in https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-if-we-build-the-internet-we-always-wanted into the post such that the post responds to both at the same time (there's a lot of overlap).

== Blog State of the Interoperable Decentralized Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

Follow-up to previous blog post and [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928064228/http://dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/decentralized_web.pdf dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/decentralized_web.pdf] (Internet Archive link, and PDF, sorry, academic source) with case studies on some projects from that blog post and the 2016 [[Decentralized Web Summit]]

Consider also explicitly citing and following-up to: 
* https://metaverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/10/decentralized-web-pt-3-indieweb/

Document from most to least interoperably deployed decentralized web solutions.

Noting second to last anything mentioned in the MIT report that is deployed with real users but single-project [[monoculture]] with all the downsides of that, fragility etc.

Noting last anything mentioned in the MIT report that is either not deployed (e.g. academic / theory / hand-waving / hype), or experimentally deployed, but no real (even [[selfdogfood]]) users.

== Blog on Open Standards for the Decentralized Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

Follow-up to previous blog posts and {{aaronpk}}’s [[OSBridge]] [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/06/22/1/osbridge 2016 talk] on the topic, focusing first and mostly on:

* Well deployed interoperable web standards (10+ interop impls with real world daily users across systems)
** [[Webmention]]
** [[Micropub]]
** [[microformats2]] ([[h-entry]], [[h-card]], [[h-feed]], etc.)
* Emerging interoperable web standards (3+ interop impls with real world daily users across systems)
** [[WebSub]]
** Maybe [[LDN]]? Double-check actual software/systems/sites in use.
* Other standards being implemented (1+ impls, maybe interop, with real world daily users within systems)
** [[ActivityPub]] - e.g. on [[Mastodon]] etc.
* Monoculture standards - "standards" only implemented (often driven by) a single implementation, summarize such [[monoculture]] problems etc.
** [[Dat]]
** [[Ethereum]]
** [[IPFS]]

== IndieWeb Homepage Live Modules ==
* [[site-homepage#New_live_modules]]

== Archive sessions and chat logs ==
Refer to [[Etherpad#Archiving_IndieWebCamp_notes|Etherpad: Archiving IndieWebCamp notes]].
* [[2019/Düsseldorf/Demos]] from chat logs
* [[2018/Nuremberg/Sessions]]

* [[2017/Nuremberg/Demos]]
* [[2017/Nuremberg/Schedule#Sunday_May_21,_2017]]
* [[2016/Berlin/Schedule]]

== Move YouTube archived content to archive.org ==
{{main|remote_participation#Archiving}}

As we've moved to storing new sessions on archive.org, you can volunteer to move old sessions there that were recorded on YouTube...and maybe even watch them as well.

If each of us take a few when time permits...we can get through them easily.

Instructed parties can enquire in chat for the credentials for our archive.org account if you do not have them.

List of session grid pages or individual videos to copy over:

* [[2019/Berlin/Schedule]]
* [[2018/Schedule]]
* [[2018/NYC/Sessions]]
* ...

== Use What You Make ==
Goals: create an actual [[use what you make]] page separate from [[eat what you cook]], and replace general use of [[selfdogfood]] with [[use what you make]].

This needs multiple steps:

* ✅ extract the "use what you make" principle and supporting text/quotes from the [[eat what you cook]] metaphor and create a new page for [[use what you make]] rather than a redirect (may need to delete & recreate so it shows up as new), as the complement to [[make what you need]].
* analyze the [[selfdogfood]] page for content that would make sense to include or move to the new [[use what you make]] page, and turn [[selfdogfood]] into more of a metaphor-focused & historical page similar to [[scratch your own itch]]
* analyze which pages link to [[selfdogfood]], manually decide if they should reference and link to [[use what you make]] instead, and update those refs/links accordingly.
* ^ similarly, analyze which pages link to [[eat what you cook]], manually decide if they should reference and link to [[use what you make]] instead, and update those refs/links accordingly.
* ✅ after creating the new [[use what you make]] page, update [[principles]] to link directly to it in principle 4

== Update brainstorming page ==
For [[brainstorming]] page:

* Describe what it is, and how to create a Brainstorming section as part of [[wikifying]]
* list the [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?search=brainstorming&title=Special%3ASearch&go=Go existing specific brainstorming pages we have] and includes a section about "Brainstorming" sections on wiki pages per [[expand_a_page#Common_Sections]].

== Update definitions with IndieWeb relevance ==
Update these pages so the [[definition]] is [[relevant to the IndieWeb wiki]]. After updating, remove the <code><nowiki>{{relevance needed}}</nowiki></code> in the page to remove it from this list.

Also review [[Special:AncientPages|older pages]] and add <code><nowiki>{{relevance needed}}</nowiki></code> as needed.

{{#categorytree:Definitions_needing_IndieWeb_relevance|mode=pages|hideprefix=always}}
== New Pages ==
New pages to create, per request, or from See Also contributions clustered into specific pages here:
=== thundering herd ===
* Start a [[thundering herd]] page with scenarios and citations from https://everything2.com/title/Slashdot+Effect http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/T/thundering-herd-problem.html RSS feed reader polling,  and most recently Mastodon distributed retrieval of link previews from shared links

* Incrementally update [[Getting Started on WordPress]] for accuracy and user-friendliness, see Chris Aldrich's work in progress on a rewrite: [[User:Boffosocko.com/wordpress-draft]] and feel free to merge from there into the current page.
* Simplify [[Category:building-blocks]] into a section with shortest possible list of IndieWeb Building Blocks necessary for interop, including using clustering to make fewer total blocks.
* add <code><nowiki>[[Category:Demos]]</nowiki></code> to past camp demo pages for inclusion to https://indieweb.org/Demos
** {{chrisaldrich}} added a bunch in 2020-07 using search, but likely didn't get them all (yet)

* stub a [[rude FAQ]] page based on the general idea as described in https://scottberkun.com/2007/how-to-write-a-rude-qa/ with answers to "but it costs money to have a domain" and "but what’s the business model"
** "but it costs money to have a domain" is concern-trolling. It's a nonsense isolated argument when everyone making that argument has spent 100x on their hardware (and annual cell service!) that they are using to make the argument. also until we have cities/states/countries providing UBS like free public water/toilets to housing & healthcare and eventually wifi & domains, if you make something "free" to users then you turn them into the exploited product. also everything costs money and if it doesn't, then someone else is paying on your behalf, and very likely getting something out of it that benefits them in some way, e.g. ads, with the exception of something like UBS which requires political changes.
** "but what’s the business model": Nope, no [[business model]] here, please go find something else to exploit you capitalist.
* split [[reacji]] and [[reacjis]] into two separate pages similar to [[like]] and [[likes]]
* Make a new [[identity loss]] page from [[why#Identity_loss]] and leave a summary in place there.
* need to split-up and re-organize any specific content from [[blockchain]] into [[Bitcoin]] or [[cryptocurrency]] (possibly [[NFT]] or just as a subsection), and [[web3]] (and maybe a few others?), creating new articles instead of redirects accordingly (please with IndieWeb-relevant [[definition]]s), so that all the edits don't go to only a small # of negative articles.
* Check past few weeks of [[newsletter]]s for heavily edited wiki pages to see if they’ve perhaps grown to big and could have large sections split into separate pages.
* Create a new page for [[aggregator]] that is a much broader description than [[reader]] or [[feed reader]] and includes things like [[IndieNews]] and other uses for the word, and redirect [[aggregators]], [[aggregate]], and [[aggregation]] to [[aggregator]]
* split [[why post]] into its own page, it’s worth its own definition and expansion
* update [[Main_Page]] to not refer to Selfdogfood and instead say to [[use what you make]] or simpler: use the web (instead of email)
* Review whether [[long-troll]] should be on the wiki, part of or redirected to something else, or deleted as unrelated to the IndieWeb (may have been an accidental/unintended page creation from chat)
* Improve [[Getting Started]] to be at least as friendly for newcomers as: https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-started-use-mastodon/
* Once they've been uploaded, figure out appropriate pages for using the images/cards from [https://boffosocko.com/2020/12/01/indieweb-advertising-cards/ IndieWeb Inspirational Cards] as "hero" images at the top

* need new page: [[JS framework]] (or [[JavaScript framework]], or some other name variant better than these) that collects the JS-specific framework information/links across the wiki, which you can find by searching for "JS framework" or "Javascript framework", and then use it as a main|JS_framework link at the top of this section: [[framework#JS]]
* Update [https://indieweb.org/Posts_about_the_IndieWeb Posts about the IndieWeb] for 2022-2023 by curating the best IndieNews articles about the IndieWeb from the [[this-week]] newsletter published in 2022-2023
* create a new page for the stream of posts from subscriptions/followings like [[home stream]] or [[news feed]], find/add press/media references to those phrases and relevant Wikipedia articles as well
* ^ note Facebook introduced its stream of posts feature as [[news feed]] per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_(Facebook)
* Consider stubbing a [[Web 2.0]] page based on the [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?search=%22Web+2.0%22&title=Special%3ASearch&go=Go numerous references to it on the IndieWeb wiki], placing it within the context of IndieWeb discussions to clearly community its relevance to the IndieWeb at least minimally in the dfn, and more in the page contents.
* Add some summary user-understandable (non-technical) IndieWeb vision/media "talking points" to [[DNS]] and [[domain name]] pages so when the press asks you about domain names, you have a crisp & clear story/explanation to provide that has a good chance of being quoted. Context: search for "domain" in https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network
* garden the [[antipatterns]] page so it is easier to skim / navigate and easily discover / reference existing anti-patterns
* Need graphic design help to [[buttons#Need_to_be_updated|Update a few past IndieWeb buttons]] from the old logo to the current logo, upload and update the [[buttons]] page accordingly.
* figure out a replacement term for "tweetable" and replace non-Twitter-specific instances of it on the wiki accordingly [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?search=tweetable Search results]
* Create a new section at the top of [[to-do]] for "New Pages to Create" and move items with redlinks in See Also up to the new section
* Come up with a term for the collaborative interactive pixel art grid thingy that both {{aaronpk}} and {{sknebel}} have on their home pages now so we can document it as an IndieWeb site feature with examples. And link to it from [[grid#See_Also]]
* ^ also link to it from [[pixel-art#See_Also]]
* create a new page for [[DNS propagation]] to document the problem/challenge of the potential time delay between purchasing a domain name. pointing domain name servers at a [[web host]], and having the domain actually serve your content on your web host. This can be a challenge for new folks at IndieWebCamps who want to setup a new site, and why we encourage new folks to purchase their domain and set it up with at least a [[static web host]] like [[GitHub pages]] on day 1, so they can get things working on day 2.
* Figure out the purpose of [[user-profile]] vs [[home page]] (especially [[homepage#Silo_Examples]]) vs [[personal feed]] and crosslink them accordingly, moving content as necessary, and summarize at the top precisely what the page is about and its relation to the others (do we need a diagram or two or three to help clarify this?)
* split [[why blog]] into its own page, moving relevant content from [[why post]] and [[blog#Why]] and [[blogging#Why_to_blog]], leaving a main template in those places with a summary perhaps of the top 3 points in the context of each page
* go through the red links on [[2023/SD/intro-demos]] and decide which ones should be redirects or [[new page]]s that are IndieWeb relevant, and create them accordingly!
* maybe split IWC-specific buttons from general concept on [[buttons]]
* fix dfn of [[ebook]] to be indieweb relevant and add IndieWeb Examples of at least aaronpk and capjamesg, and See Also [[pandoc]]
* [[lost]] site unlinking: search for kylewm(.)com davidpea(.)ch notenoughneon(.)com links on the wiki and at a minimum wrap them in "nowiki" tags and if they’re in IndieWeb Examples sections, move them to a "Previous Examples" subsection, and ideally add http://archive.org links from around the time their links were added to each page.
* Consider deleting redirect and creating a new page for [[80x15]] with its own IndieWeb Examples section (e.g. IndieWeb itself [[buttons#80x15]], global site footer of https://aaronparecki.com/ ), maybe Organization examples (e.g. https://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikimania(80x15).gif) and links to galleries like https://web.badges.world/
* Go through past [[IndieWebCamps]]/[[cities]] individual camp pages, for each that has a "Photos" section (each should!), expand dfn to summary of the camp & stats, location including city state (if any) country, nth camp overall, nth in-person (or nth online), nth in country, nth in city/region (e.g. LA as one city region), n total number of participants (remote-only in parens), n sessions (link), n hours of sessions, n hours of recordings (link to playlist of all sessions), keynotes (if any) on topics 1 2 3 (linked recordings) by keynoters A B C (linked personal sites), finishing with n demos
* create a page on [[non-technical]] defining it as an unhelpful & unwelcoming othering phrase per discussion in https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-01-18#t1705610390349800
** "capjamesg, also the very framing of "people who are not technical" is unwelcoming" [http://Tantek.com @[tantek]] January 18, 2024
* go through the wiki and copy edit / repair / replace uses of "non-technical" or "non technical" with more helpful & [[welcoming]] text, leaving archived meeting/session notes as-is because history is what it was [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?search=%22non-technical%22+%22non+technical%22&title=Special%3ASearch&profile=default&fulltext=1 Search results]
* check the high level pages which link to [[IndieMark]] and re-evaluate if it is serving the intends purpose for those pages or not, and if not, add to [[IndieMark#todo]] or similar what needs to be improved about IndieMark
* process https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-01-18 topics for /discuss FAQs re: terminology and why/why not to discuss some topics in some channels, and hybrid user/technical origins of IndieWeb vs today's desired user-centric focus by default and movement of all technical specific details to dedicated channels (#indieweb-dev #indieweb-wordpress #indieweb-known) and wiki page sections or technical wiki pages.
* add an FAQ somewhere about "I am a software engineer and I either do not understand IndieWeb or am discouraged by the technical nature" as pointed out by aciccarello & capjamesg in https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-01-18#t1705609257598800, and note possible explanation https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-01-18#t1705609365641600
* consider creating a page on [[full stack]] debunking the assumption and self-described use of "full stack" by some webdevs to mean they know everything about web development from the server to the pixels (they usually don't) and worse, the anti-learning perspective that "full-stack" reinforces, if you're already "full", that means you have no need or capacity to consume any more knowledge then right?
* Consider creating pages for [[publish]] and/or [[publishing]] from an IndieWeb perspective that go [[beyond blogging]]
* come up with a replacement for "itches" in the context of [[wikifying#Write_down_your_itches]] and for the [[itches]] page itself (see alternatives at the bottom there) and update that wikifying section accordingly to be more broadly appealing
* delete and recreate and actual [[meta tag]] page listing IndieWeb uses of the meta tag whether for viewport, [[metaformats]], or some other actual specific IndieWeb use-case, then link to MDN for the generic meaning / use, no need to duplicate generic info here
* figure out where to document a discoverable place for newcomers to feel welcome to introduce themselves. Perhaps delete/recreate [[introduction]] for this purpose and create a separate stub [[introduction session]] article documenting the first session at IndieWebCamps like [https://indieweb.org/2019/Introduction 2019/Introduction]

** "Hey #indieweb #openweb #webstandards folks, I'm writing a piece for @fumacapt on why RSS matters and why it's cool. Can you share your personal perspective, resources you go back to, clients for different platforms?That would be ace. It's going to be out next week, and it's in Portuguese."

* Create a simple stub page for [[terms of service]] with redirects [[TOS]], [[ToS]], [[tos]] that documents examples of terms of service from personal sites (if any?), [[silos]], and others(?), and especially egregious unilateral changes of ToS like that by [[EyeEm]]: https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/photo-sharing-community-eyeem-will-license-users-photos-to-train-ai-if-they-dont-delete-them/
* capture the IWC DUS 2021 intro demos notes from chat into the page itself as noted on the stub page now: [[2021/Düsseldorf/Intros]]
* [[Webmention]] page needs a specific subsection for services for sending webmentions and then redirects from https://indieweb.org/s/12Uj and https://indieweb.org/s/12Ui to that specific subsection fragment identifier, for easier discoverability to help folks who have a static site or similar send webmentions without having to setup webmention sending directly on their website
* delete the redirect [[visibility]] and recreate [[visibility]] as a new user-centric page documenting the user-relevant aspects of the visibility of posts, linking to pages/terms like [[public]], [[unlisted]], [[protected]], [[private]], and summarizing what they mean, how they are different, and perhaps including related work in [[Micropub extensions]], other protocols, and tools support. See also [[audience]]
* file a feature request issue (or directly submit a PR) on http://fxtwitter.com to add h-entry and h-card support for better webmention, reply-context, link-preview  etc support
* file a feature request issue (or directly submit a PR) on http://ddinstagram.com to add h-entry and h-card support for better webmention, reply-context, link-preview  etc support
* purge "Pega" spam from 2024-05-18 meta IRC logs
* Expand the [[blockchain]] article with more graphics and more easily understood criticism, citing for example: https://cdn.jwz.org/images/2022/weargloves.jpg which is from https://xkcd.com/2030/
* Figure out how to disentangle and disambiguate [[readers]] meaning Feed Readers (e.g. see [[Special:WhatLinksHere/readers]]) and the user-friendly term "readers" to mean people reading a/your personal website, which is more active and action-specific than [[followers]] which implies a different relationship.
* ^ per [[events/2024-05-29-hwc-europe]] discussion
* garden and update [[reply-chain]] page, reverify IndieWeb Examples, stub screenshots needed, software/service examples, perhaps distinguish reply-chain shown below a post vs above a post as part of its [[reply-context]]
* to do: consider splitting out [[privacy policy]] into its own page from [[disclosure]]
* Remove [[http://Pine.blog]] as a recommendation from pages like [[Quick Start]] and [[IndieWeb as a Service]]. It has a shutdown notice on the website (as of 2025-01-10). Look to see if Brian Schrader has an announcement somewhere.
* Consider creating an [[unpublished]] page based on the mentions in [https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Search&search=unpublished Search results for unpublished], e.g. SearchResults 1 – 7 of 7

* Go through [[:Category:Sessions]] and embed in-place iframe for the video recording, as in this example: https://indieweb.org/2019/shareprivately
* Consider starting a page on [[The 5k]] (https://the5k.org/), as mentioned in [[events/2024-09-12-front-end-study-hall]], note archive https://web.archive.org/web/20040202051437/http://www.the5k.org/ especially if any IndieWeb folks submitted sites.

* More grist for an [[RSS nostalgia]] page: [[RSS Club]] which claims a practice and examples of "only" publishing content in RSS, while in practice at least one (likely nearly all) of the examples given are available on the web, as websites, in HTML, typically called "blogs", thus not "only" in "RSS", unless they are now using RSS even more ambiguously to refer to blogs as well.
