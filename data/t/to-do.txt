Questions? Ask in our [[discussion]] channels!

Roughly ordered by importance / oldest first.

== Update How to Run an IndieWebCamp page/documentation ==
*We need an easier/simpler/shorter "how to run an IndieWebCamp" page / documentation https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps
* We need IndieWebCamp in a box prepared to send to new organizers https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamp_kit
** Things like "Hello my URL is" stickers, sticky notes for the grid, maybe masking tape. Or at least a list of things to order and have delivered to the venue
* https://indieweb.org/Introduction Need to update that redirect to the latest Introduction session!
* Questions to ask registrants like: food prefs, childcare needs etc
* Decrease challenges like all the wiki pages, the nice pages at 2017.indieweb.org/ etc
**Keeping the choice of which ticketing system to use, for regional prefs. E.g. Tito eventbrite brownpapertickets or even Meetup
* Possible templates for typical camp pages and planning layout so it doesn't have to be reinvented

== Fix Domain Pages ==
* [[personal-domain]] is quite a mess, it needs to be simplified for typical users, not technical types, and no experimental nonsense like namecoin which should all be moved to its own page
* [[domain_name_registrar]] also needs massive clean-up and simplification, providing maybe 2-3 recommended registrars to use and why, with notes on domain privacy etc.
* Either combine / merge [[personal-domain]] and [[domain_name_registrar]], or clearly define why we have each one (what is the specific purpose of each page, when should something go on one vs the other)

== Improve [[Getting Started]] ==
In progress of updating [[Getting Started]] steps to:
* simplify steps (create subpages if necessary for longer explanations)
* reduce steps to only those that are required and have direct benefits
** i.e. are direct steps toward achieving [[IndieMark]] levels in various areas.
** provide an explicit "Why?" quick and easily understandable explanation of the benefits, the motivating reasons for taking this step. What problems are solved? What new capabilities do you get by taking this step.
* re-order steps in order of ease of implementation / dependency 
* move nice-to-haves, or simpler side options, to other pages.

I've updated [[Getting_Started#Connect|Connect]] and [[Getting_Started#Personal_Domain|Personal Domain]] accordingly (including subsuming short domain as a "bonus" subpart of personal domain) so far and will work on subsequent Getting Started steps accordingly. However, if you want to help with these updates, please go for it and edit accordingly! - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 15:06, 7 May 2013 (PDT)

Currently working on:
* [[Getting_Started#Partial_Solutions|Partial Solutions]] - which needs a very heavy rewrite and likely moving of most (if not all) of its content to other pages, since partial solutions are a bit of a branch off/away-from real indieweb support.
* ...

== Improve [[Why]] Explanation ==
* create subsections on [[why]] for frustration, fear, death
* provide good photo/summary page links (e.g. lightboxes of screenshots) for all corp site failures on [[site-deaths]] and [[why]] pages.
* copy each "why" citation for a silo to a Criticisms or Downtime section for that silo

== Quoting Embedding Display ==
Quoting Embedding Display (QED) guidelines:
* Write IndieWeb versions of embedding/quoting display guidelines for when other sites display indie web posts/content
See: '''[[quoting]]''' for details and see [[reply-context]] for some thinking/progress.

== Tagboards ==
Create additional Tagboards (e.g. http://tagboard.com/indieweb ) for IndieWeb related things, and any tags used/mentioned by [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp] (or [https://twitter.com/indiewebcampuk @indiewebcampuk]) and link them to the respective wiki pages here.

== Process Criticism ==
* If/when you see IndieWeb critical (or silo apologist) articles, add to: [[challenges#Citations_to_process]]

* Go through [[challenges#Citations_to_process]] and analyze the articles, extracting new [[FAQ]]s and specific challenges for the IndieWeb to overcome.

== Blog Update to Call For A Distributed Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

* Blog an update of the 2+ year old http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/ from an IndieWeb perspective, what IndieWeb technologies have solve the problems in the original post, status of the experimental tech the original post mentioned, etc.

* Include references to https://rhiaro.github.io/thesis/ since it is newer than Brewster's post and has lot broader coverage of projects, efforts etc.

Bonus, also integrate the points / proposals / projects mentioned in https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-if-we-build-the-internet-we-always-wanted into the post such that the post responds to both at the same time (there's a lot of overlap).

== Blog State of the Interoperable Decentralized Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

Follow-up to previous blog post and http://dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/decentralized_web.pdf (PDF, sorry, academic source) with case studies on some projects from that blog post and the 2016 [[Decentralized Web Summit]]

Consider also explicitly citing and following-up to: 
* https://metaverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/10/decentralized-web-pt-3-indieweb/

Document from most to least interoperably deployed decentralized web solutions.

Noting second to last anything mentioned in the MIT report that is deployed with real users but single-project [[monoculture]] with all the downsides of that, fragility etc.

Noting last anything mentioned in the MIT report that is either not deployed (e.g. academic / theory / hand-waving / hype), or experimentally deployed, but no real (even [[selfdogfood]]) users.

== Blog on Open Standards for the Decentralized Web ==
(more than one person blogging about this would be good)

Follow-up to previous blog posts and {{aaronpk}}’s [[OSBridge]] [https://aaronparecki.com/2016/06/22/1/osbridge 2016 talk] on the topic, focusing first and mostly on:

* Well deployed interoperable web standards (10+ interop impls with real world daily users across systems)
** [[Webmention]]
** [[Micropub]]
** [[microformats2]] ([[h-entry]], [[h-card]], [[h-feed]], etc.)
* Emerging interoperable web standards (3+ interop impls with real world daily users across systems)
** [[WebSub]]
** Maybe [[LDN]]? Double-check actual software/systems/sites in use.
* Other standards being implemented (1+ impls, maybe interop, with real world daily users within systems)
** [[ActivityPub]] - e.g. on [[Mastodon]] etc.
* Monoculture standards - "standards" only implemented (often driven by) a single implementation, summarize such [[monoculture]] problems etc.
** [[Dat]]
** [[Ethereum]]
** [[IPFS]]

== IndieWeb Homepage Live Modules ==
* [[site-homepage#New_live_modules]]

== See Also ==
* [[wikify]]
* [[wiki]]
* [[social web map]]
* [[events]]
* '''Unprocessed to do items below here:''' (process/prioritize them and move them into the lists above)
* reply to https://twitter.com/estoner/status/918609048471183360 and thread with specific indieweb suggestions and invitations
* reply to https://twitter.com/estoner/status/918627524267016192 with mf2 h-card + XFN markup as a concrete existing (simpler?) alternative
* reply to https://twitter.com/michaelgorsuch/status/918628829454897152 with W3C Webmention (URL) and see h-entry for reply etc. markup
* Add [[Woodwind]] to all the tables in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators
* add h-feed and WebSub to the columns of this table https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators#Web_feed_and_protocol_support, note which feed readers support either or both, and reach out to other OSS in that table requesting support (filing GH issues accordingly, and linking to them on their indieweb wiki pages!)
*  help with tracking down (with citations!) the YYYY-MM-DD dates for the items listed here that would be helpful! [[timeline#Needs_Dates_and_incorporation_above]]
* Write a descriptions of how indieweb [[building blocks]] have been tied together in various implementations to make a clearer more complete independent (decentralized) social web picture
* Look into developing a "mf2 upgrade" module for the "soil" WordPress Plugin https://github.com/roots/soil that would upgrade any Theme/Frontend microformat etc. markup to use mf2, re-using code and logic from https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-uf2
* Identify whole dead [[projects]] from https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=projects&diff=prev&oldid=41350 and move/archive them to another page accordingly, perhaps with archive-org links for their dead links
* write up something similar (as user-accessible and devoid of jargon) as https://macgenie.micro.blog/2018/04/10/a-guide-to.html adapted for IndieWeb, e.g. on "A Guide to the IndieWeb For People Who Have A Love/Hate Relationship With Twitter" obviously crediting the original as inspiration
* Create a page that lists / analyzes / shows IndieWeb Equivalents to https://medium.com/@anildash/the-missing-building-blocks-of-the-web-3fa490ae5cbc and is easily findable e.g. by searching for "Missing Building Blocks"
* low priority, but for comprehensiveness, make sure we have at least stub articles so we can have an updated place to document these (most of which we already do) https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/Protocols
* Analyze [[litepub]] SSG for existing use of or potential for microformats2 markup per https://github.com/mirovarga/litepub#overview and submit minimal pull requests accordingly to improve LitePub’s [[mf2]] support.

** "Why not just use your own domain for your to-do list and own your task. Here is my example: https://jgregorymcverry.com/my-to-do-list/ I send myself a webmention as updates. I have used Google Keep as well and just pin a “to-do, doing,  done” (http://jgregorymcverry.com/6265-2/)" [https://jgregorymcverry.com/ @jgmac1106] August 28, 2018
* split [[FAQ]] developer questions into their own [[developer FAQ]] (everything in FAQ should be written accessibly enough to answer anyone curious about IndieWeb, journalists, etc.)
* move Historical sections of pages to their own pages
* highlight best of breed screenshots for as many pages as possible near the tops of pages to immediately convey a product or spec or even concept
* update references to PuSH to use WebSub instead e.g. on [[friendly]]
* Create an issue on Coralproject / talk https://github.com/coralproject/talk/issues asking to "Support Micropub to keep a copy of your comments on your own blog", noting the use-case / real-world example that there are Coral users that created their own Tumblr to just to manually keep a copy of their comments!
