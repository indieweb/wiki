'''<dfn>tvtag</dfn>''' (formerly '''GetGlue''') was a social service for checking in to TV shows, movies, and sports that you are watching. It shut down on 2015-01-01.

In 2016, the <nowiki>getglue.com</nowiki> domain redirected to [https://twitter.com/telfieapp @Telfieapp on Twitter] which advertised a similar service, <nowiki>telfie.com</nowiki> ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170102022106/http://telfie.com/ archived]), though it appeared to be a separate service that bought out the getglue domain. As of 2025-05-05, the telfie domain appears to be unrelated/spam and the getglue domain is for sale.
