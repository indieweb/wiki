    '''<dfn>tvtag</dfn>''' (formerly '''GetGlue''') was a social service for checking in to TV shows, movies, and sports that you are watching. It shut down on 2015-01-01.

The getglue.com site now redirects to [https://twitter.com/telfieapp @Telfieapp on Twitter] which advertises a similar service [http://telfie.com/ Telfie], though it appears to be a separate service that bought out the getglue domain.
