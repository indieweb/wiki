The '''<dfn>temporary shutdown</dfn>''' of a website is a means to express support for a cause by closing one's website for a day and displaying a campaign message instead - a form of [[one day banner]] activism.

== Examples ==

=== SOPA Blackout 2012 ===
[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/18/sopa-blackout-protest-makes-history "The largest online protest in the history of the internet"] 2012-01-18

=== Global Climate Strike 2019 ===
Website shutdowns were promoted as one form of digital participation in the Global Climate Strike of 2019-09-20.

== Considerations for implementation ==
When participating in a temporary shutdown campaign:
* Consider whether this may also impact functionalities beyond the frontend, such as APIs/endpoints etc.
* Display a clear message to site visitors what is going on and why, incl. a link to more information on the cause
* It possible, return HTTP 503 to avoid negative SEO impact [https://www.wired.com/2012/01/protest-sopa-blackout-your-website-the-google-friendly-way/], [https://yoast.com/http-503-site-maintenance-seo/]
* Where applicable, keep legally required links and pages alive (German "Impressum", privacy policy etc.)
