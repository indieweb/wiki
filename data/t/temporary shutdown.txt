The '''<dfn>temporary shutdown</dfn>''' of a website is a means to express support for a cause by closing one's website for a day and displaying a campaign message instead - a form of [[one day banner]] activism.

== Considerations for implementation ==
When participating in a temporary shutdown campaign:
* Consider whether this may also impact functionalities beyond the frontend, such as APIs/endpoints etc.
* Display a clear message to site visitors what is going on and why, incl. a link to more information on the cause
* If possible, return HTTP 503 to avoid negative SEO impact [https://www.wired.com/2012/01/protest-sopa-blackout-your-website-the-google-friendly-way/], [https://yoast.com/http-503-site-maintenance-seo/]
* Where applicable, keep legally required links and pages alive (German "Impressum", privacy policy etc.)

Many sites have blacked out their home pages, some with lists of black individuals who have lost their lives to police brutality and others. E.g.:
