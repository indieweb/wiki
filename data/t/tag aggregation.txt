'''<dfn>tag aggregation</dfn>''' is a feature of some search, indexing, and bookmarking sites that collect [[tag]]ged posts from many different sites, including IndieWeb sites, and present them for exploration by topic, and sometimes related or highly correlated topics.

If you’re looking for pages on individual sites that show all their own posts with a tag, or all the tags they’ve used, see:
* [[tag page]]
* [[tags page]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== IndieNews ===
The [[IndieNews]] project have tag aggregation going for it's multi-language mechanism by enabling sites to submit itself to one of the language sections by setting that section as a [[u-category]] and sending a [[Webmention]] for it.

== Silo Examples ==
Examples from [[silos]] on their websites:

=== Past Silo Examples ===
* [[Delicious]]
* [[Technorati]] Tags results

== Overloaded naming ==
The term "tag aggregation" is currently overloaded / ambiguously used.

This page uses aggregating tags as meaning across sites, imply multiple (remote) sources.

We decided to use a different name for a tagged posts on one site: [[tag page]] per the below brainstorming:

Brainstorming / existing use:
* tag feed
** "feed" implies you can subscribe to it and that the content is reverse time ordered and updates often
* tag stream - {{t}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag collection - {{t}} ;) brainstorm suggestion
** {{kartikprabhu}} points out [[collection]] implies curation which means something else
* tag exhaust - {{shaners}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag page - {{kartikprabhu}} brainstorm suggestion
** +1 {{t}} phrase allows for many different models (including feed/stream or other presentations)
** +1 {{aaronpk}} my tag pages are also a feed, since they are reverse chronological and have microformats markup, but I prefer the term "tag page"
** +1 {{aciccarello}} I think of them using this term
