'''<dfn>tag aggregation</dfn>''' is a mechanism to collect posts from many different sites in one central shared taxonomy

== Overloaded naming ==
The term "tag aggregation" is currently overloaded / ambiguously used.

This page uses aggregating tags as meaning across sites,  imply multiple (remote) sources.

The [[tag]] page links here asserting via example that "tag aggregation" could just be across posts on one site.

We should use a different name for a tagged posts on one site.

Brainstorming / existing use:
* tag feed
** "feed" implies you can subscribe to it and that the content is reverse time ordered and updates often
* tag stream - {{t}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag collection - {{t}} ;) brainstorm suggestion
** {{kartikprabhu}} points out [[collection]] implies curation which means something else
* tag exhaust - {{shaners}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag page - {{kartikprabhu}} brainstorm suggestion
** +1 {{t}} phrase allows for many different models (including feed/stream or other presentations)
** +1 {{aaronpk}} my tag pages are also a feed, since they are reverse chronological and have microformats markup, but I prefer the term "tag page"

Once we decide on a name for the "posts just on one site (or profile/person/author?)" we should link to that from the [[tag]] markup example that currently links to "tag aggregation"

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* The [[IndieNews]] project have tag aggregation going for it's multi-language mechanism by enabling sites to submit itself to one of the language sections by setting that section as a [[u-category]] and sending a [[Webmention]] for it.

== Silo Examples ==
Examples from [[silos]] on their websites:

=== Flickr ===
Flickr calls them "Recently tagged" and has separate sections in one tag aggregation page for your things with that tag vs all things on their site with that tag.

=== Medium ===
Medium aggregates tagged posts from all of their users into one shared taxonomy across all of Medium where it presents them in lists.

Examples:

* https://medium.com/tag/criminal-justice-reform
