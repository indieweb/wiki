{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Timezones</dfn>''' are names used to highlight regions on the globe that are used to define a uniform time for society's use (legal, finance, social). Examples of them are Pacific Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Savings Time.

== Criticism ==

'''<dfn>timezones</dfn>''' are a way to create dependencies in your code on legislative bodies in countries you have never heard of.
