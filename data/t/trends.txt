== Criticism ==
=== State Level Actor Manipulation ===
[[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] have been criticized for not recognizing or identifying when trending hashtags may be the result of bot accounts run by state level actors (e.g. Russia) artificially inflating the popularity of particular politically motivated hashtags.
