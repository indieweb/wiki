A '''<dfn>tip</dfn>''' is a small amount of money given to a person to show appreciation for a service they have provided; on the IndieWeb, a site can have a tip page for others to show appreciation for it, and for individuals to have a simple URL to share for others to tip them, like for technical help provided without an explicit payment request.

For an alternate definition of tip in the sense of a [[recommendation]], please see that page.

== Why ==
You should have a tip page on your site so that:
* You can link to it from your home page so those that enjoy your posts can tip you.
* You can link to it from private email responses you give to folks asking for technical support.

__TOC__
== How to ==
(stub)

Create a simple tip page at /tip on your domain, and even better, allow a nested amount which prefills / preselects a tip amount, while perhaps providing alternatives. See [[pay]] for similar patterns.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has had a "[https://aaronparecki.com/tip/ tip jar]" on his website since 2017-03-08. The page has three suggested amounts (coffee, a drink, dinner), and a field to enter a custom amount. Choosing an amount then updates the Square, PayPal and credit card buttons to pre-fill that amount when clicked.

=== Jason Park ===
Clicking the [[PayPal]] icon on http://jasonpark.me opens a window where you can donate a few pre-selected amounts.

=== Peter Molnar ===

The tip links are added on build time statically, with a message depending on the category of the post. For now, it's a pre-filled value of 3GBP, using either PayPal or Monzo (UK only). No JS included.

=== Artur Paikin ===
Artur Paikin has a "thanks" page which links to several ways to "say thanks by sending me a little money"

=== Tantek ===
As of 2018-02-01, {{t}} has a "Tip" page linked from his home page (tantek.com) using a üëè with a default of $1 already filled in, similar to his [[pay]] page. "Tip" seemed to make more sense in wording and in URL as a link from the home page.
* e.g. http://tantek.com/tip/1

=== capjamesg ===

As of 2022-01-21, {{capjamesg}} has a tip page on his site available at https://jamesg.blog/tip/. The tip page is not linked anywhere on the site. It was made with the idea that having a dedicated tip page may make social payments easier (i.e. James can say, "you can pay me for the coffee at jamesg.blog/tip/"), although anyone can send a tip.
