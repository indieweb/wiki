* Example of visual display of transit time reach in a dynamic way, hover over a city/station and see differently colored expanding regions based on time to reach various destinations by train: https://chronotrains-eu.vercel.app/
* Train wifi is consistently poor enough across various countries and routes that multiple alternative high-efficiency websites have been created by hobbyists to be significantly more usable on train wifi than official train websites, e.g. US: https://amtrack.live/, UK: https://traintimes.org.uk/, https://realtimetrains.co.uk
