[[https://toolbox.imoxia.com toolbox]] is a hosted [[web application]] which offers the ability to perform various tasks to assist people with checking that their website is "doing the right thing" with respect to discovery of:

* indieweb profile
* indieweb endpoints for [[IndieAuth]], [[Micropub]], [[Microsub]], etc)
* authorization server metadata (per [[IndieAuth]] and rfc8414)
* blogging APIs via Really Simple Discovery (RSD)

and to offer auxiliary activities such as to:

* perform authorization code introspection
* fetch public resources
* fetch private resources (with the possibility for hands-off authorization code retrieval)
* retrieve ip whois records

toolbox is developed by {{omz13}} and is written in TypeScript for the web browser client side, and [[golang]] for the server side, and uses a lightweight REST API to various libraries/packages which implement discovery and operational functionality, wrapped with server-side rendering to reduce load and simplify browser side aspects. The name "toolbox" was chosen because [[naming]] is hard and life is too short to come up with a cute or perfect name when a utilitarian one will suffice.
