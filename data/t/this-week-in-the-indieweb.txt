== How to ==

=== How to add events to the newsletter ===
The newsletter gets the list of upcoming and past events from https://events.indieweb.org. Make sure the event has a name and start date. Photos from the event will also be included, so you can either upload photos directly to the event page, or post them on your site as a reply to the event URL and send a webmention!

=== How to add blog posts to the newsletter ===
You can add any post to the newsletter by submitting it to [[IndieNews]]! You can submit your own posts by adding a u-syndication URL, or you can submit other people's posts by bookmarking them on your site. Full details are available here: https://news.indieweb.org/how-to-submit-a-post


=== How to add podcast episodes to the newsletter ===
You can add podcast episodes to the newsletter by posting them on Huffduffer and tagging them [https://huffduffer.com/tags/indieweb #indieweb]. Any new podcasts added there this week will be included in the newsletter

== When ==
This week's post is published on Fridays at 15:00 PDT

* 20:30 PT Thursday: first draft generated e.g. [https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-07-27/1501212617346000 2017-07-27]
* ...
* 14:30 PDT Friday: last preview draft generated and announced in IRC for previewing.
* 14:50 PDT Friday: final post is generated
* 15:00 PDT Friday: Mailchimp generates the email from the post on the server, and 
** sends it to all email subscribers, and 
** it is tweeted out from @indiewebcamp.

== Ideas ==
Other things you'd like to see in the weekly summary:

New features:
* '''Mentioned indieweb.org pages''': indieweb.org pages that have received webmentions this week (in descending order of # of mentions)
** Perhaps combine somehow with recently edited wiki pages?
* '''Active Projects'''
** issues+commits to relevant source code repositories (github.com/indieweb, or possibly from a list of source repositories on the wiki, maybe all repos linked from [[Projects]]?)
*** Thus need to add essential [[building blocks]] libraries like [[microformats2]] parsers to [[Projects]]
* '''IndieWeb tagged blog posts'''
** new blog posts from community members ([[chat-names]]?) with <code>p-category</code> "indieweb"

Enhancements to existing features
* use [[Census]] to retrieve h-cards for domains to use their icon and name instead of domain name, e.g.: from/to:
** Events 14 edits by tantek.com and aaronparecki.com
** Events 14 edits by {{t}} and {{aaronpk}}

Reminders:
* Suggest [[Loqi]] remind us once 12-24 hours earlier
** make some sort of trigger that people can do in IRC that will make Loqi regenerate it after adding to it, otherwise it's like adding things to a black box

More ideas:
* Check [[site-homepage#New_live_modules]] for new ideas of for "this week" as well

== FAQ ==
=== Why sent on Friday ===
Q: Why is "This week in indieweb" sent out on Friday and not on the weekend?

A: Midday Friday is a good day and time to send out "This week in indieweb" for a number of reasons:
* Fridays tend to be slower (in terms of getting things done) so it makes sense to use that time to capture / reflect / broadcast what's been done the rest of the week.
* Lunchtime (Pacific Timezone) on Friday seems like a good time where (many) people in the community may be available to make last minute edits for the weekly summary.
* Friday seems a better day to send it out, especially since it also tweets a link to it, and Saturday evening seems like not the best time to have a tweet be seen.[https://indieweb.org/irc/2016-05-22/line/1463934669321]
* Sending it on Friday is also a good encouragement for folks (especially in Europe!) to take the (rest of the) evening off.

=== What photos are included in the tweet ===
Twitter allows either exactly 1 gif, or up to 4 photos to be included in a tweet.

If there are any gifs in the newsletter, the most recent one is included in the tweet.

If there are no gifs, then the most recent 4 photos are included.

== Other Examples ==
=== Digest ===
