A '''<dfn>tag page</dfn>''' is a page that provides a way to browse and navigate posts on that site with a specific tag.

If you’re looking for a page of the tags in use on a site, see:
* [[tags page]]

If you’re looking for sites that aggregate tagged content across sites, see:
* [[tag aggregation]]

Once we decide on a name for the "posts just on one site (or profile/person/author?)" we should link to that from the [[tag]] markup example that currently links to "tag aggregation"

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{aaronpk}} has tag pages at /tag/NAME_OF_TAG
* ...

== Silo Examples ==
Examples from [[silos]] on their websites:

=== Flickr ===
Flickr calls them "Recently tagged" and has separate sections in one tag page for your things with that tag vs all things on their site with that tag.

=== Medium ===
Medium aggregates tagged posts from all of their users into one shared taxonomy across all of Medium where it presents them in lists.

Example:
* https://medium.com/tag/criminal-justice-reform

== Naming Background ==
Previous in the [[tag aggregation]] page, we realized that the term was ambiguously used for the specific meaning of aggregation across sites, as well as collections of tagged posts on a single site. The following brainstorm & discussion resulted in choosing "tag page" and thus the creation of this page:

Brainstorming / existing use:
* tag feed
** "feed" implies you can subscribe to it and that the content is reverse time ordered and updates often
* tag stream - {{t}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag collection - {{t}} ;) brainstorm suggestion
** {{kartikprabhu}} points out [[collection]] implies curation which means something else
* tag exhaust - {{shaners}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag page - {{kartikprabhu}} brainstorm suggestion
** +1 {{t}} phrase allows for many different models (including feed/stream or other presentations)
** +1 {{aaronpk}} my tag pages are also a feed, since they are reverse chronological and have microformats markup, but I prefer the term "tag page"
** +1 {{aciccarello}} I think of them using this term
