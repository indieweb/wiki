A '''<dfn>tag page</dfn>''' is a page that provides a way to browse and navigate posts on that site with a specific tag.

If you’re looking for a page of the tags in use on a site, see:
* [[tags page]]

If you’re looking for sites that aggregate tagged content across sites, see:
* [[tag aggregation]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has tag pages at /tag/NAME_OF_TAG, e.g.
* http://aaronparecki.com/tag/indieweb

His tag pages include a list of the following, all date-time ordered together:
* all of his [[posts]] (of any kind) with that tag
* any comments with that tag made [[in-reply-to]] his posts
* any posts of others' with that tag that he replied to.

* ...

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{martymcguire}} added linked tag support on 2017-02-20. Tags appear in the footer or header of posts, marked up with <code>.p-category</code> and linked to a tag page.
* https://martymcgui.re/tag/indieweb/

=== Eddie Hinkle ===
{{eddiehinkle.com}} implemented linked tags (on 2018-01-01).
* linked tags in his posts (specifically, [[hashtags]]) to tag pages, e.g.:
** https://eddiehinkle.com/tag/indieweb
His tag pages include a list of the following, all date-time ordered together:
* all of his [[posts]] (of any kind) with that tag


=== Past Examples ===
==== Kyle Mahan ====
{{kylewm}} had tag pages: has an old-fashioned list of tags at the end of each post. [[hashtags]] that are added inline automatically populate the tag list (so that they will appear twice, once inline, once in the list). (Originally implemented in [[Red Wind]] (on [https://github.com/kylewm/redwind/commit/e5f5b3248489c85742600df1ed37098ba6139f7b 2014-05-09]) (on development hiatus), now implemented by using [[Known]]).
* Example: <nowiki>https://kylewm.com/tag/indieweb</nowiki> (needs Internet Archive link)


== Silo Examples ==
Examples from [[silos]] on their websites:

=== Flickr ===
Flickr calls them "Recently tagged" and has separate sections in one tag page for your things with that tag vs all things on their site with that tag.

=== Medium ===
Medium aggregates tagged posts from all of their users into one shared taxonomy across all of Medium where it presents them in lists.

Example:
* https://medium.com/tag/criminal-justice-reform

== Naming Background ==
Previously in the [[tag aggregation]] page, we realized that the term was ambiguously used for the specific meaning of aggregation across sites, as well as collections of tagged posts on a single site. The following brainstorm & discussion resulted in choosing "tag page" and thus the creation of this page:

Brainstorming / existing use:
* tag feed
** "feed" implies you can subscribe to it and that the content is reverse time ordered and updates often
* tag stream - {{t}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag collection - {{t}} ;) brainstorm suggestion
** {{kartikprabhu}} points out [[collection]] implies curation which means something else
* tag exhaust - {{shaners}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag page - {{kartikprabhu}} brainstorm suggestion
** +1 {{t}} phrase allows for many different models (including feed/stream or other presentations)
** +1 {{aaronpk}} my tag pages are also a feed, since they are reverse chronological and have microformats markup, but I prefer the term "tag page"
** +1 {{aciccarello}} I think of them using this term
