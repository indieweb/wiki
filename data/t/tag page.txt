A '''<dfn>tag page</dfn>''' is a page that provides a way to browse and navigate posts on that site with a specific tag.

If you’re looking for a page of the tags in use on a site, see:
* [[tags page]]
If you’re looking for sites that aggregate tagged content across sites, see:
* [[tag aggregation]]
If you’re looking for tags inline in content preceded with a '#', see:
* [[hashtag]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has tag pages at /tag/NAME_OF_TAG, e.g.
* http://aaronparecki.com/tag/indieweb

His tag pages include a list of the following, all date-time ordered together:
* all of his [[posts]] (of any kind) with that tag
* any comments with that tag made [[in-reply-to]] his posts
* any posts of others' with that tag that he replied to.

* ...

=== Marty McGuire ===

* https://martymcgui.re/tag/indieweb/

=== Past Examples ===
==== Kyle Mahan ====
{{kylewm}} had tag pages: has an old-fashioned list of tags at the end of each post. [[hashtags]] that are added inline automatically populate the tag list (so that they will appear twice, once inline, once in the list). (Originally implemented in [[Red Wind]] (on [https://github.com/kylewm/redwind/commit/e5f5b3248489c85742600df1ed37098ba6139f7b 2014-05-09]) (on development hiatus), now implemented by using [[Known]]).

== Software Examples ==
Examples of publishing software that automatically creates tag pages for each tag used for posts on a site using that software.
=== Mastodon ===
[[Mastodon]] creates tag pages for each tag in every post by every user on an instance or shown in the home feed of a user on that instance. E.g.
* https://indieweb.social/tags/indieweb
And then shows all posts on that instance with that tag, and all posts with that tag shown in the home feed of any user on that instance. In this way, Mastodon’s tag pages are somewhere between a single-site-specific tag page and an all-sites  "[[tag aggregation]]" page.

== Silo Examples ==
Examples from [[silos]] on their websites:

=== Flickr ===
Flickr calls them "Recently tagged" and has separate sections in one tag page for your things with that tag vs all things on their site with that tag.

=== Medium ===
Medium aggregates tagged posts from all of their users into one shared taxonomy across all of Medium where it presents them in lists.

Example:
* https://medium.com/tag/criminal-justice-reform

== Naming Background ==
Previously in the [[tag aggregation]] page, we realized that the term was ambiguously used for the specific meaning of aggregation across sites, as well as collections of tagged posts on a single site. The following brainstorm & discussion resulted in choosing "tag page" and thus the creation of this page:

Brainstorming / existing use:
* tag feed
** "feed" implies you can subscribe to it and that the content is reverse time ordered and updates often
* tag stream - {{t}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag collection - {{t}} ;) brainstorm suggestion
** {{kartikprabhu}} points out [[collection]] implies curation which means something else
* tag exhaust - {{shaners}} :P brainstorm suggestion
* tag page - {{kartikprabhu}} brainstorm suggestion
** +1 {{t}} phrase allows for many different models (including feed/stream or other presentations)
** +1 {{aaronpk}} my tag pages are also a feed, since they are reverse chronological and have microformats markup, but I prefer the term "tag page"
** +1 {{aciccarello}} I think of them using this term
