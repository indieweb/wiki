<dfn>tiered-architecture</dfn> refers to the organisation of a computer system into multiple, hierarchical logical groups; with a chronological dependence. i.e. one must exist / finish before another. You might have a GitHub pages website which uses Jekyll, which would require your blog posts to be pushed to GitHub (storage), then generated by GitHub (action / task runner) in order to be served by the pages service.
