** [[chronological feed]] - what social media timelines originally were
** [[algorithmic feed]] - what social media has done to them
** [[wall]] - what Facebook originally called their timeline
** [[public timeline]] - what Twitter launched with, stream of all public tweets
** [[homepage]] - more commonly used in the indieweb community

In every case, a source pointing to an exact date or community verification should be used.

== needs cleanup ==

The following need cleanup for what aspects need to be documented as historical events of what types (conceived, term defined, specified, implemented, event, etc.)


Blog posts of why IndieWeb is important.

Webmention.io and pingback.me before that

Note: Below is a draft of unorganized data with rough dates. Needs cleanup. Source: @caseorganic conversation with @t, IndieWebCamp UK 2013-09-08 

---

2003:

Rise of Pingback Spam

Decline of Personal Sites
*Distracted by RSS/ATOM wars, blogs began to decline
*Hosted blogs, people turned to social networks more than blogging 
*Eventual fade of RSS/ATOM

2007:
* [[DiSo]] initiative launched

2010: State of Blogs
*Not much personal blog activity
*WordPress heavy and dominant
* [[DiSo]] initiative last post - future of DiSo

2013:
*Github hosted blogs, Medium for frontpage Hacker News

Siloed blogging and writing frameworks. 
*MEDIUM: Don’t claim ownership but reserve the right to use your content even if they get acquired in the future. 
*Wikia: Communities don’t own their content and can’t transfer it off their site. 

Differences between 2013 and 2003 
*Short status updates became an acceptable form of content 
*Easy enough to show an entire conversation or a link to another page 

[[2011]] (E): IndieWebCamp Conf
*Purpose: Show, don’t tell 
*Builders Only. Must have your own domain name and actively build stuff for it to attend. 
*Use your domain name and OpenID to sign into the IndieWebCamp MediaWiki. http://indiewebcamp.com/
*Could only add self to the attendee list if you use your domain name to log into the site.

2012: 
*IndieAuth implemented on IndieWebCamp.com (replaced OpenID)
*2012-06 (E): [[2012|IndieWebCamp2012]]: changed from Builders-only to Creators-only to more explicitly include UX+design
**Again, could only add self to the attendee list if you use your domain name to log into the site.
*Domain Name, rel=me, mediawiki
* 2012-09 (E): [[2012/UK|IndieWebCampUK 2012]] (first in the UK)
