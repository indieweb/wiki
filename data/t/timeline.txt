---

2003:

Rise of Pingback Spam

Decline of Personal Sites
*Distracted by RSS/ATOM wars, blogs began to decline
*Hosted blogs, people turned to social networks more than blogging 
*Eventual fade of RSS/ATOM

2007:
* [[DiSo]] initiative launched

2010: State of Blogs
*Not much personal blog activity
*WordPress heavy and dominant
* [[DiSo]] initiative last post - future of DiSo

2013:
*Github hosted blogs, Medium for frontpage Hacker News

Siloed blogging and writing frameworks. 
*MEDIUM: Don’t claim ownership but reserve the right to use your content even if they get acquired in the future. 
*Wikia: Communities don’t own their content and can’t transfer it off their site. 

Differences between 2013 and 2003 
*Short status updates became an acceptable form of content 
*Easy enough to show an entire conversation or a link to another page 

[[2011]] (E): IndieWebCamp Conf
*Purpose: Show, don’t tell 
*Builders Only. Must have your own domain name and actively build stuff for it to attend. 
*Use your domain name and OpenID to sign into the IndieWebCamp MediaWiki. http://indiewebcamp.com/
*Could only add self to the attendee list if you use your domain name to log into the site.

2012: 
*IndieAuth implemented on IndieWebCamp.com (replaced OpenID)
*2012-06 (E): [[2012|IndieWebCamp2012]]: changed from Builders-only to Creators-only to more explicitly include UX+design
**Again, could only add self to the attendee list if you use your domain name to log into the site.
*Domain Name, rel=me, mediawiki
* 2012-09 (E): [[2012/UK|IndieWebCampUK 2012]] (first in the UK)

* Example presentation of past & future events: https://www.instagram.com/p/CZDx5OarV_Q/
* to-do: Extract dates from http://martin.atkins.me.uk/activity-streams/ regarding AS1/Atom and AS1JSON, e.g. AS concepts at IIW 2008, AS1/Atom first draft, first AS meetup 2009-01-08 at SixApart, AS1/JSON first draft
* to-do: add [[OSBridge]] conference/barcamp events to the timeline, given relevance to IndieWeb talks given and adjacency to first IndieWebCamp [[2011]]
* Possible sources of (C)oncepts or (T)erminology origins and maybe relevant (E)vents if any discussed anything related to eventual IndieWeb concepts, principles, technologies: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-socialweb/ and https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-federatedsocialweb/ (would be interesting if there are any messages about anything that was (L)aunched or (I)mplemented which eventually became part of IndieWeb things)
