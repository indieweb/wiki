I find personal websites interesting. I came to the IndieWeb community because I saw many people who were chatting about the ins and outs of websites. I started off without much interest in building anything technical. I have never felt I had to do anything from scratch to participate. I already had a domain name and after joining the chat I was able to quickly start talking with some interesting people about websites.

Since joining over a year ago, the IndieWeb community has been an invaluable source of support. I ask questions about websites, share what I am working on, and try to help other people with their personal sites.

I'd encourage anyone who is interested in having their own website or who has a website to join IndieWeb or at least join our chat for a day or two and say hello. We're a friendly bunch and there's something for everyone, from engineers who want to take control over their data through coding, all the way to people who have never owned a site and are looking to take their first steps.

I'm capjamesg in the chat. Say hello!

And so I felt a whole lot more welcomed!

** "@futurebird I can say it no better than the front page of that wiki: "The #IndieWeb is a community of independent & personal websites connected by simple standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain & using it as your primary identity, publishing on your own site (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data." More: https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb <br/>#ActivityPub is one protocol that can be used as part of an IndieWeb site." [https://social.sdf.org/@mjgardner @mjgardner] December 22, 2022
