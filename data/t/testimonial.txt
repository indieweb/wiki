I find personal websites interesting. I came to the IndieWeb community because I saw many people who were chatting about the ins and outs of websites. I started off without much interest in building anything technical. I have never felt I had to do anything from scratch to participate. I already had a domain name and after joining the chat I was able to quickly start talking with some interesting people about websites.

Since joining over a year ago, the IndieWeb community has been an invaluable source of support. I ask questions about websites, share what I am working on, and try to help other people with their personal sites.

I'd encourage anyone who is interested in having their own website or who has a website to join IndieWeb or at least join our chat for a day or two and say hello. We're a friendly bunch and there's something for everyone, from engineers who want to take control over their data through coding, all the way to people who have never owned a site and are looking to take their first steps.

I'm capjamesg in the chat. Say hello!

And so I felt a whole lot more welcomed!

** "@futurebird I can say it no better than the front page of that wiki: "The #IndieWeb is a community of independent & personal websites connected by simple standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain & using it as your primary identity, publishing on your own site (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data." More: https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb <br/>#ActivityPub is one protocol that can be used as part of an IndieWeb site." [https://social.sdf.org/@mjgardner @mjgardner] December 22, 2022

** "There are real downsides to running my website on VPS I sysadmin myself & a homegrown pile of code in JavaScript, Python, Swift, and Zsh. The code is all over the place in every sense of the phrase. But I can personally guarantee that it'll keep working and remain available so long as I can afford the DNS and VPS fees. I can't say that about any other place I post on the internet. Own your own space on the web. Post there. Write there. Link to it from your various accounts elsewhere. #indieweb" [https://mastodon.social/@hober @hober] June 30, 2023

** "@jeremy And I think this is an important issue holding back the #IndieWeb - it's like a skunkworks for great web ideas. But, because it's sooo decentralized, there are many different Proof-of-Concept implementations orbiting an empty space where professional products should be.I think the next stage is for individual developers to stop tinkering on their own sites and bring IndieWeb products out to the market for regular people to use.It's a race, and I'm coding as fast as I can."

** "@xandra Yes! I really enjoyed reading this piece ðŸ§¡. The #indieweb is a place to be yourself, and find others who are, well.. who THEY are. Forget about likes, forget about follower counts, forget about page views. I have found, both in my own experience writing on my site as well as in my journey exploring other sites across the "indieweb" that it's people being truly *genuine* in both their writing and their style that brings life back to the web."
