'''<dfn>theme</dfn>''' is an interchangeable set of [[templates]] and front-end code. Themes makes it easy to switch between different front-end code for the same back-end code.

Themes may sometimes be able to extend and configure the system in which are used and define certain capabilities of it self. Themes may also have ways to split up big templates into more focused parts. Themes can also sometimes inherit templates etc from a defined parent theme.

== Open Source Examples ==

[[WordPress]] (the software) supports themes. WordPress themes can extend each other through [https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes child themes], provide [https://codex.wordpress.org/Functions_File_Explained additional capabilities] and also [https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_theme_support define it's own capabilities].

=== Standalone Theme Engines ===

==== Tema ====

{{voxpelli}} has built and is using a standalone [[Node.js]] theme engine, [https://github.com/voxpelli/node-tema Tema], for some of this projects, such as [http://webmention.herokuapp.com/ A WebMention Endpoint]. It's inspired by how eg. [[Drupal]]'s themes works and supports child themes, rewriting render requests, using multiple template engines in the same theme etc.
