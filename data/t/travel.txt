== Why ==
* To inform friends where you are going in the future so you can get together
* To record and share memories from past trips
* Can be used to automatically track total amounts by mode of transport to impact on carbon footprint (See [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/19/guardian-climate-pledge-2019-air-travel-advice How to explore the world without harming it: Guardian climate pledge 2019])
