* Why: by making travel posts, and perhaps an aggregation per month & year, you could automatically track total amounts by mode of transport, e.g. to help follow advice like: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/19/guardian-climate-pledge-2019-air-travel-advice
* [https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/africa/southern-serengeti-tanzania/ Paul Stamatiou's Photo journals] are a great display of past travel
