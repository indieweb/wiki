* cognitive reload [[2014/reposts#Repost_presentation]], brainstorm markup expected to achieve that presentation, add said markup explicitly to [[repost#Brainstorming]], link to that from [[2014/reposts#Repost_presentation]] as a For Follow-up See Repost Brainstorming
* brain dump two #indieweb ideas ([[location]] at vs about, [[checkin]] how to markup) to the wiki from https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-24#t1477349895913000 and https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-25#t1477425283318000 then blog about both!
* add to http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed new "Backward Compatibility" section with subsections "Publisher Compatibility" and "Parser Compatibility" (like [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card#Backward_Compatibility in h-card]), documenting classic [http://microformats.org/wiki/hAtom hAtom] "hfeed" classes for publisher compat, and the corollary for Parser Compat with additional class names per https://github.com/kevinmarks/mf2py/commit/9c7ba2c051292b5dbce2a6e9378fcec46e20a94d Blogger and WordPress defaults inside hfeed
* https://indieweb.org/authorship#Questions
* consider updating various projects indieweb support/compat sections to IndieWeb Friendly section with subsections similar to [[Falcon#IndieWeb_Friendly]], e.g. [[GNU_social#IndieWeb_Compatibility]] (how should we archive past services Spreadly and App.net's former support?)
* write-up and expand [[note#How_to]]
* reflect on what it means to "standardize [[federation]]"
** e.g. in the context of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4013#note_27767988 ([https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/30991 see also this issue])
** figure out what additional documentation on [[federation]] and other pages would help implementers
* reflect on what [[building blocks]] could use improved tutorials for implementing, e.g. like [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/activitypub/gh-pages/activitypub-tutorial.txt this tutorial]
** could any use better diagrams [https://social.tchncs.de/users/mray/updates/54900 like this]?
* Update tantek/contact add to homescreen script for iOS10 from https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen
* update [[RSVPs]] display markup/linking to link directly to indie RSVPs (maybe with the going checkmark / interested asterisk etc.?)
* write a speaker's agreement addendum: If site information about the event, talks, speakers requires JS to view, the speaker is granted a CC-by license to republish any/all event site information so that it does not require JS to view.
* keep processing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufBLI6bB9sg for adding to: [[Loqi#IndieWeb_x_Loqi_Dominate_the_Day]]
* write an mf2 to indieweb version of this article, showing which minimal, typical, maximal properties to use for which effects in indieweb posts and interactions: https://moz.com/blog/meta-data-templates-123
* figure out how to implement delegation on his site so he can have others post for / as him, things like the indie event for HWC SF.
* move https://github.com/tantek/post-type-discovery into the indieweb organization, especially to enable moving ptd.spec.indieweb.org onto a new server with auto-deploy stuff set up and aaronpk needs admin access to the repo to do that
* Broken: try https://indieweb.org/Instagram#Single_Photo_Bookmarklet and either deprecate & document errors, or attempt to quickly fix it
* Atom feed: drop likes, because even fallback content apparently causes poor UX in feed consumers like some micro.blog clients. Write up how this is a good example of Atom / AS1 failure to be extensible, and this unsuitable for evolving social web interactions
* document how lightning talks work at IndieWebCamps, both intros at start, and demos session at the end
* ^^^ maybe not use the label "lightning" - might be more confusing than useful? -- sknebel
* consider helping out with maintenance of [[mf2 plugin]], look at https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/wordpress-pubsubhubbub/blob/c17cf4269ab738ac3ca33fad76a587e425caba56/pubsubhubbub.php#L80 as an example of how mf2 plugin could filter out / rewrite the errant presence of "hfeed" in post permalink markup
* Write-up a [[microformats#FAQ]] for IndieWeb specific questions about microformats that were asked on a recent day in chat starting here https://chat.indieweb.org/2019-06-08#t1560029007948800
