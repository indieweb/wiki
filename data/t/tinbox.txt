I'm collecting requests from [[IRC]] here when they're something I can't handle quickly and immediately. Roughly FIFO, feel free to re-arrange if you have reasons to suggest a specific prioritization
* document existing [[Webmention]] sender/receiver interop beyond [[Webmention]] specification as minimal W3C Notes in (new if needed) https://tantek.com/github repos. Minimal preamble/intro/abstract, conformance classes (publishers, receivers), what publishers should do (list 3 impls that do, link to more), what receivers should do (list 3 impls that do, link to more). minimize overlap between Notes.
** [[post-type-discovery]]
*** document how existing consuming implementations parse for [[mf2]]
*** document and cite existing consuming implementations, link to more on indieweb wiki. 
*** cite list of IndieWeb Examples of each post type in the spec
** [[WebComment]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[reply]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents).
*** commonalities in displaying [[comments]]
*** AKA WebComments or "Web Comments".
** [[WebLike]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[like]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents)
*** commonalities in displaying [[likes]]
*** AKA WebLikes or "Web Likes".
** [[WebRepost]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[repost]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents)
*** commonalities in displaying [[reposts]]
*** AKA WebReposts or "Web Reposts".
** [[WebRSVP]] - document how implementations that receive and detect a webmention [[RSVP]]:
*** use which properties for what (e.g. author name & photo, post name/contents)
*** commonalities in displaying [[RSVPs]]
*** AKA WebRSVPs or "Web RSVPs".
** [[post-type-discovery]] update to reference those
*** links from Response Type Discovery algorithm to [[WebComment]], [[WebLike]], [[WebRepost]], [[WebRSVP]] accordingly
*** once a reply/like/repost/RSVP is detected, what to do
* blog about, describe, how to do '''notification first design''' and '''text only design'''
** Use as example: [[like#notification_first_design]], text only design (autolinked text design), inline hypertext design

* cognitive reload [[2014/reposts#Repost_presentation]], brainstorm markup expected to achieve that presentation, add said markup explicitly to [[repost#Brainstorming]], link to that from [[2014/reposts#Repost_presentation]] as a For Follow-up See Repost Brainstorming
* brain dump two #indieweb ideas ([[location]] at vs about, [[checkin]] how to markup) to the wiki from https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-24#t1477349895913000 and https://chat.indieweb.org/2016-10-25#t1477425283318000 then blog about both!
* Document the corollary for http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed Parser Compat with additional class names per https://github.com/kevinmarks/mf2py/commit/9c7ba2c051292b5dbce2a6e9378fcec46e20a94d Blogger and WordPress defaults inside hfeed
* https://indieweb.org/authorship#Questions
* consider updating various projects indieweb support/compat sections to IndieWeb Friendly section with subsections similar to [[Falcon#IndieWeb_Friendly]], e.g. [[GNU_social#IndieWeb_Compatibility]] (how should we archive past services Spreadly and App.net's former support?)
* write-up and expand [[note#How_to]]
* reflect on what it means to "standardize [[federation]]"
** e.g. in the context of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4013#note_27767988 ([https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/30991 see also this issue])
** figure out what additional documentation on [[federation]] and other pages would help implementers
* reflect on what [[building blocks]] could use improved tutorials for implementing, e.g. like [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/activitypub/gh-pages/activitypub-tutorial.txt this tutorial]
** could any use better diagrams [https://social.tchncs.de/users/mray/updates/54900 like this]?
* Update tantek/contact add to homescreen script for iOS10 from https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen
* update [[RSVPs]] display markup/linking to link directly to indie RSVPs (maybe with the going checkmark / interested asterisk etc.?)
* write a speaker's agreement addendum: If site information about the event, talks, speakers requires JS to view, the speaker is granted a CC-by license to republish any/all event site information so that it does not require JS to view.
* keep processing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufBLI6bB9sg for adding to: [[Loqi#IndieWeb_x_Loqi_Dominate_the_Day]]
* write an mf2 to indieweb version of this article, showing which minimal, typical, maximal properties to use for which effects in indieweb posts and interactions: https://moz.com/blog/meta-data-templates-123
* figure out how to implement delegation on his site so he can have others post for / as him, things like the indie event for HWC SF.
* move https://github.com/tantek/post-type-discovery into the indieweb organization, especially to enable moving ptd.spec.indieweb.org onto a new server with auto-deploy stuff set up and aaronpk needs admin access to the repo to do that
* Broken: try https://indieweb.org/Instagram#Single_Photo_Bookmarklet and either deprecate & document errors, or attempt to quickly fix it
* Atom feed: drop likes, because even fallback content apparently causes poor UX in feed consumers like some micro.blog clients. Write up how this is a good example of Atom / AS1 failure to be extensible, and this unsuitable for evolving social web interactions
* document how lightning talks work at IndieWebCamps, both intros at start, and demos session at the end
* ^^^ maybe not use the label "lightning" - might be more confusing than useful? -- sknebel
* consider helping out with maintenance of [[mf2 plugin]], look at https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/wordpress-pubsubhubbub/blob/c17cf4269ab738ac3ca33fad76a587e425caba56/pubsubhubbub.php#L80 as an example of how mf2 plugin could filter out / rewrite the errant presence of "hfeed" in post permalink markup
* Write-up a [[microformats#FAQ]] for IndieWeb specific questions about microformats that were asked on a recent day in chat starting here https://chat.indieweb.org/2019-06-08#t1560029007948800
** "Hi all, is there a page I can point to that represents a reference of all IndieWeb markup?" [ @rubenverborgh] June 8, 2019
* watch [[2019/building-blocks]] video and type up q&a
* simplify [[Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_Twitter]] by: <br>1. removing use of [[permashortcitation]] (and only using [[permashortlinks]]) and <br>2. extract inline use of CASSIS functions in POSSE explanations, and instead provide them as specific techniques after the full prose explanations.
* re-evaluate [[permashortcitation]] examples and update that page accordingly to reflect actual practices as of today
* update CASSIS auto_link function YT embedding to use privacy enhanced mode [[YouTube#How_to_embed_with_privacy-enhanced_mode]]
* Write an update to [http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web On Silos vs an Open Social Web [#indieweb]]
* incorporate into webmention/reply-context storage brainstorming, and on [[Falcon#Working_On]]: https://indieweb.org/Webmention-brainstorming#storage - IWC 2016
* simplify (restructure if necessary) [[wikify]] to be more approachable and usable (at a minimum not stress out aaronpk)
* as part of ^, create [[definition]] page for how to write a good definition, extract related content from [[wikifying#Definitions_include_indieweb_relevance]] onward, and: all pages should start with being the best source for basic knowledge on their subject
