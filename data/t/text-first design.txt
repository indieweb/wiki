{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Text-first design</dfn>''' refers to the practice of designing information so that it is usable/actionable in its most basic plaintext form. It is also a form of progressive enhancement, where the most basic form is text, adding increasing amounts of non-text content such as hyperlinks or images.[http://tantek.com/2014/361/t8/text-first-design-universal-listenable-accessible]

== Examples ==
* [[like#text_only_design]]

== News Sites ==
Both [[CNN]] and [[NPR]] have entire text-only sites with text-only articles etc. that load and render very quickly.

== Pre-web examples ==
Pre-web examples of plain text publishing are a useful source of empirical examples of explicit formatting using only plain text.

=== LOD ===

Much/most of this was written pre-web (1987-1993), lots of formatting conventions in the examples therein. LOD was constructed by various authors; apparently each author had their own formatting styles. For example:

    ----------
    Test Sets
    ----------

    Test Sets
    ----------

  
    Test Sets
    ======

can all mean something we'd now refer to as H2; therefore it offers a wide choice of readable text formatting.

=== ZIGZAG ===
I am including this one not for it's subject matter, but rather as an example of block-quotes and paragraph styling that was common back in the day of 80 column displays and Courier-only printers...
