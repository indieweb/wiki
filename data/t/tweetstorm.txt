    '''<dfn>tweetstorm</dfn>''' is a series of tweets, each replying to the previous, often each numbered so the sequence is clear, as a method of expressing a longer series of related thoughts as a single thread on [[Twitter]]. 
 
On/about 2019-04-24 Twitter changed their UI (on web) to allow users to edit multiple threaded tweets at the same time and click one button to publish them all simultaneously.

== Why ==
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I post this in the CPLC moodle? I don&#39;t even know my dudes. Not gonna lie, I&#39;m 10000% more comfortable writing this stuff on Twitter bc it feels less formal &amp; therefore doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;organized&quot; or &quot;actually good&quot; &amp; can just sometimes end up being surprisingly useful?</p>&mdash; Jessica Chretien (@infuturereverse) <a href="https://twitter.com/infuturereverse/status/1130113434593517568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2019</a></blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Kevin Marks ===
{{kevinmarks}} often tweetstorms live notes (using [[Noter Live]], without numbering tweets) from conferences and talks, and then later assembles them into a blog post on his site kevinmarks.com.

== Other Examples ==
=== Damon Jones ===
[https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/damon-jones Damon Jones] [https://twitter.com/nomadj1s/status/893627602350612480 Twitter Thread Tutorial] Damon Jones wrote a 13 tweet series explaining how to do a Twitter thread as of 2017-08-04. 
=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} only very occasionally tweetstorms (using [[Noter Live]], without numbering tweets). Most often it is from conferences, talks, or meetings and then he later assembles them into a post on his own site.
* Examples: 
** http://boffosocko.com/2016/10/13/notes-from-day-1-of-dodging-the-memory-hole-saving-online-news-thursday-october-13-2016/ 
** http://boffosocko.com/2016/10/15/notes-from-day-2-of-dodging-the-memory-hole-saving-online-news-friday-october-14-2016/

For more "traditional" tweetstorms, I:
* compose them on my site for style and length
* cut and paste them into [[Noter Live]] in rapid succession 
* I use Noter Live without the username filled in, so the tweets appear to come from me on Twitter without including my @handle; Noter Live also auto-threads the tweetstorm in the Twitter stream, so clicking on any one Tweet provides the entire thread/"story".
* I cut and paste the richer Noter Live data into my original post and publish or update the post
* I tweet one final note to Twitter with a link back to the compilation on my site and include that in my post
* Finally, I manually backfill all of the syndicated links onto the original post for future [[backfeed]].
The process is an odd melange of both [[POSSE]] and [[PESOS]], but it's typically geared towards reaching a broader Twitter audience over the traditional audience of my personal site. The benefit is that those who are subscribed to my personal site get a better experience.

=== Marc Andreessen ===
Marc Andreessen often posts tweetstorms (on https://twitter.com/pmarca) that seem sufficiently structured that more than one site has sprung up which reposts them as complete blog posts:
* https://pmarcatweetsasblogposts.tumblr.com/
* https://pmarcasays.golaun.ch/

He sometimes reposts his own tweetstorms on his own blog:
* http://blog.pmarca.com/ (which itself has its own unofficial archive: https://pmarchive.com/)
E.g.
* http://blog.pmarca.com/2014/06/13/this-is-probably-a-good-time-to-say-that-i-dont-believe-robots-will-eat-all-the-jobs/

== Service Examples ==
There are many services which recognize tweetstorms and ‚Äúunroll‚Äù them into single page permalink posts, (semi-)automatically, usually triggered by an @-mention of the service and a keyword like ‚Äúunroll‚Äù or ‚Äúcompile‚Äù.

=== Readwise ===
[[Readwise]] is a service with a Twitter account (@readwiseio) that will convert a tweetstorm into presumably a single page (presumably private) permalink by replying to any tweetstorm‚Äôs post with the key phrase "save thread"

E.g.:
* https://twitter.com/readwiseio/status/1309209103475056640 <blockquote>Done! We've saved this whole thread to your library so you can revisit/remember it <br />üß† <br />üìö <br /><br />Stats:<br />‚Ä¢ 4 saves of this thread (ranked #444)<br />‚Ä¢ 1 unique save of mozilla's threads (ranked #1078)<br />‚Ä¢ 4 total saves of mozilla's threads (ranked #509)</blockquote>

* Example: 75+ tweets spanning 17+ months, estimated ~1hr reading time: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/943238420037431297.html (tweet start: https://twitter.com/kentbye/status/943238420037431297 )

=== tweetstorm io ===
[http://tweetstorm.io tweetstorm.io] is a site that detects tweetstorms on Twitter user profiles, displays their recent tweet storms, and provides permalinks for each tweetstorm they detect. E.g. recent tweetstorm(s) of a profile:
* http://tweetstorm.io/user/FreedomofPress/ and tweetstorm permalink: 
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/FreedomofPress/798614923832070144
* http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman and multiple tweetstorm permalinks from that profile:
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801242086834049024
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801227823432269824
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801120843443175425 (has two tweetstorms)
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/798573934836793344
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/798177603358232576
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/796362835999727617 (appears to combine two tweetstorms)

=== Thread Reader ===
[[ThreadReaderApp]] (aka Thread Reader) is a service with a Twitter account (@threadreaderapp) that will convert a tweetstorm into a single page post by replying to any tweetstorm‚Äôs post with the key word "unroll"
E.g.:
* https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1258035535936921601.html
** from: https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/1258128589523910658
** request: https://twitter.com/SsteveAdanielsS/status/1258128587552628736
* Example: 75+ tweets spanning 17+ months, estimated ~1hr reading time: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/943238420037431297.html (tweet start: https://twitter.com/kentbye/status/943238420037431297 )

On 2020-05-28 the service began unveiling a beta feature that allows users to syndicate ([[PESOS]]) Twitter threads to their personal websites using [[Micropub]].

=== Unroll Thread ===
[https://unrollthread.com/ Unroll Thread] is a service that has a Twitter account (@UnrollThread) that will create a serialization of a tweetstorm also by replying to a tweetstorm‚Äôs last post with <blockquote>@UnrollThread unroll</blockquote>
E.g.:
* https://unrollthread.com/t/1258035535936921601/
** from: https://twitter.com/UnrollThread/status/1258254713004294144

=== Threader ===
[https://threader.app/ Threader] App also has a Twitter account (@threader_app) and creates one-page compilations of tweet storms by replying with <blockquote>@threader_app compile</blockquote>
E.g.:
* https://threader.app/thread/1263858543448424449 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20200523195041/https://threader.app/thread/1263858543448424449 archived])

== Application Examples ==
=== Stormcrow ===
[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stormcrow/id1171471363?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4 Stormcrow] is a native [[iOS]] app for writing tweetstorms. It was created and released on [https://jaredsinclair.com/2017/03/27/stormcrow.html 2017-03-27] by Jared Sinclair.

== Threadjacking ==

Threadjacking is a microagression where a reader may interject a series of replies into an existing thread with a different topic. Derived originally from email lists and Bulletin board the practice is evident in Twitter threads.

Other practices of thread jacking can include examples of mansplaining by defining terms the author may already know, trying to elevate their own work by linking to the author's threads, or [[snitchtagging]] a person the author is discussing.


== Brainstorming ==
=== How do you cite repost or quote ===
How do you [[cite]], [[repost]], or [[quote]] a tweetstorm?

{{rhiaro}} suggests a single repost, with individual blockquote elements for each tweet of the tweetstorm with different dated permalink for each.

{{gRegor}} has quoted tweetstorms with blockquote + [[h-cite]]:
* https://gregorlove.com/2016/09/darren-seals/
* https://gregorlove.com/2016/11/if-you-are-pro-life-stop/
** h-cite markup needs to be updated to include p-content

=== How do you POSSE to tweetstorm ===
==== article to tweetstorm ====
If you write your own blog post ([[article]]), but want to [[POSSE]] it as a tweetstorm, how do you do it?

I think {{benwerd}} was wondering about this.

See Indieweb example above by {{chrisaldrich}}.

One idea would be to publish a [[note]] and then if you publish a [[reply]] to that note in your publshing UI you could hit a "storm" or "stream" button. This edite the original note putting in a rel=next. The second post would would get a rel=prev. This pattern would continue until someone hit end "storm" button.

The first note would display all the replies in the storm. The second note would display n-1 (everything but the first).

==== tweetstorm UI ====
Or perhaps tweetstorms "work" because of the Twitter UI's constraints.

Perhaps an indieweb tweetstorm UI should similarly build on a [[note]] with a chain of [[reply]] posts.

=== Tweetstorm Syntax ===
There appears to be two kinds of tweetstorm syntax:
* List style: numbered (1.) from start to end, e.g. http://tweetstorm.io/user/FreedomofPress/798614923832070144
* Continuation style: numbered (1/) at the end tweets except for last tweet in the tweet storm, e.g. http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801242086834049024

== Criticism ==
There is a wide variety both for and against tweetstorms:

* It is a common criticism that instead of tweetstorming, writers should post their content as an [[article]], often on their own website. Of course one could certainly do both.

* Criticism (satire) https://twitter.com/timhwang/status/1216396096072835074

** "hello people can you PLEASE fucking stop doing endless variations on "this should have been a post instead of a Twitter thread" when someone chooses Twitter as a platform for a longer thread it is annoying AND ableist AND it's not news to anyone that blog posts exist" [http://denise.dreamwidth.org @rahaeli] June 7, 2018
