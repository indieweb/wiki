{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>tweetstorm</dfn>''' is a series of tweets, each replying to the previous, often each numbered so the sequence is clear, as a method of expressing a longer series of related thoughts as a single thread on [[Twitter]].
 
On/about 2019-04-24 Twitter changed their UI (on web) to allow users to edit multiple threaded tweets at the same time and click one button to publish them all simultaneously.

== Why ==
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I post this in the CPLC moodle? I don&#39;t even know my dudes. Not gonna lie, I&#39;m 10000% more comfortable writing this stuff on Twitter bc it feels less formal &amp; therefore doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;organized&quot; or &quot;actually good&quot; &amp; can just sometimes end up being surprisingly useful?</p>&mdash; Jessica Chretien (@infuturereverse) <a href="https://twitter.com/infuturereverse/status/1130113434593517568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2019</a></blockquote>

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Kevin Marks ===
{{kevinmarks}} often tweetstorms live notes (using [[Noter Live]], without numbering tweets) from conferences and talks, and then later assembles them into a blog post on his site kevinmarks.com.

=== Chris Aldrich ===
{{chrisaldrich}} only very occasionally tweetstorms (using [[Noter Live]], without numbering tweets). Most often it is from conferences, talks, or meetings and then he later assembles them into a post on his own site.
* Examples: 
** http://boffosocko.com/2016/10/13/notes-from-day-1-of-dodging-the-memory-hole-saving-online-news-thursday-october-13-2016/ 
** http://boffosocko.com/2016/10/15/notes-from-day-2-of-dodging-the-memory-hole-saving-online-news-friday-october-14-2016/

For more "traditional" tweetstorms, I:
* compose them on my site for style and length
* cut and paste them into [[Noter Live]] in rapid succession 
* I use Noter Live without the username filled in, so the tweets appear to come from me on Twitter without including my @handle; Noter Live also auto-threads the tweetstorm in the Twitter stream, so clicking on any one Tweet provides the entire thread/"story".
* I cut and paste the richer Noter Live data into my original post and publish or update the post
* I tweet one final note to Twitter with a link back to the compilation on my site and include that in my post
* Finally, I manually backfill all of the syndicated links onto the original post for future [[backfeed]].
The process is an odd melange of both [[POSSE]] and [[PESOS]], but it's typically geared towards reaching a broader Twitter audience over the traditional audience of my personal site. The benefit is that those who are subscribed to my personal site get a better experience.


== Service Examples ==
=== tweetstorm io ===
[http://tweetstorm.io tweetstorm.io] is a site that detects tweetstorms on Twitter user profiles, displays their recent tweet storms, and provides permalinks for each tweetstorm they detect. E.g. recent tweetstorm(s) of a profile:
* http://tweetstorm.io/user/FreedomofPress/ and tweetstorm permalink: 
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/FreedomofPress/798614923832070144
* http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman and multiple tweetstorm permalinks from that profile:
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801242086834049024
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801227823432269824
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801120843443175425 (has two tweetstorms)
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/798573934836793344
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/798177603358232576
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/796362835999727617 (appears to combine two tweetstorms)
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/797516935093190658
** http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/796362835999727617 - use of a tweetstorm to put together thoughts that eventually went into a singular blogpost:

=== Stormcrow ===
[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stormcrow/id1171471363?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4 Stormcrow] was created and released on [http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/158917878165/stormcrow 2017-03-27] by Jared Sinclair.

=== Thread Reader ===
[https://threadreaderapp.com Thread Reader] will convert a tweetstorm back into a single page post.

== Brainstorming ==
=== How do you cite repost or quote ===
How do you [[cite]], [[repost]], or [[quote]] a tweetstorm?

{{rhiaro}} suggests a single repost, with individual blockquote elements for each tweet of the tweetstorm with different dated permalink for each.

{{gRegor}} has quoted tweetstorms with blockquote + [[h-cite]]:
* https://gregorlove.com/2016/09/darren-seals/
* https://gregorlove.com/2016/11/if-you-are-pro-life-stop/
** h-cite markup needs to be updated to include p-content

=== How do you POSSE to tweetstorm ===
==== article to tweetstorm ====
If you write your own blog post ([[article]]), but want to [[POSSE]] it as a tweetstorm, how do you do it?

I think {{benwerd}} was wondering about this.

See Indieweb example above by {{chrisaldrich}}.

==== tweetstorm UI ====
Or perhaps tweetstorms "work" because of the Twitter UI's constraints.

Perhaps an indieweb tweetstorm UI should similarly build on a [[note]] with a chain of [[reply]] posts.

=== Tweetstorm Syntax ===
There appears to be two kinds of tweetstorm syntax:
* List style: numbered (1.) from start to end, e.g. http://tweetstorm.io/user/FreedomofPress/798614923832070144
* Continuation style: numbered (1/) at the end tweets except for last tweet in the tweet storm, e.g. http://tweetstorm.io/user/paulkrugman/801242086834049024
