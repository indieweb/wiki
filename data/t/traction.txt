{{stub}}

'''<dfn>traction</dfn>''' is often short for external validation, and the lack thereof is sometimes given as an excuse for shutting down ([[site-death]]) a site or project and usually an example of lacking sufficient use of the "scratch your own itch" IndieWeb [[principle]], because if you were scratching your own itch you would not need external validation to continue working on it.
