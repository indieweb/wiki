'''<dfn>terminal green</dfn>''' is both a specific shade of green (#4AF262) and a [[design]] aesthetic based on that or a similar bright green on black (usually monospace) text as a nod to 20th century ([[1970s]]) green phosphorous monochrome computer terminals, used on a few personal sites, and sometimes as a site theme, or a temporary blog theme.
