'''<dfn>terminal green</dfn>''' is both a specific color (or two) of bright green and a [[design]] styling based on green on black (usually monospace) text as a nod to 20th century green phosphorous monochrome computer terminals, used on a few personal sites, and sometimes as a site theme, or temporary blog theme.
