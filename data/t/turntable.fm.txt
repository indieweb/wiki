'''<dfn>[https://turntable.fm Turntable.fm]</dfn>''' is a social music site that lets you create [[playlist]]s of music from [[YouTube]] and take turns playing them to an audience of fellow listeners. The site and application closed in 2014 and re-opened in 2021.

== History ==
In December 2013, it was announced they would shut down the service to focus on Turntable Live, allowing musicians to perform online concerts. By early 2014, Turntable Live had quietly disappeared. Turntable.fm did not resolve currently and turntable.com was listed as being for sale.

Turntable.fm returned in March 2021 [https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313793/turntable-fm-return-two-versions-original].
