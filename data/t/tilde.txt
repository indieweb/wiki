A '''<dfn>tilde</dfn>''' is a community on a shared *nix server, the network of these servers is a or the <dfn>tildeverse</dfn>. Often called a <dfn>pubnix</dfn>, the term 'tilde' more specifically applies to a loose organization of pubnixes with shared values and some cooperation around resources such as configuration, IRC network, and mutual assistance. 

The "tilde" (~) of the name alludes to the "unix user folder" pattern of providing a default website to users at the server name prefixed with a tilde (~) and username (e.g. <em><nowiki>https://tilde.example.org/~username/</nowiki></em> )
