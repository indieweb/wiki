A '''<dfn>tilde</dfn>''' is a community on a shared *nix server usually run by hobbyists or other independents, named after the leading tilde '~' character for user profiles, and a few IndieWeb community members have accounts on tilde servers; the network of these servers is <em>a</em> or <em>the</em> <dfn>tildeverse</dfn>.

Often called a <dfn>pubnix</dfn>, the term 'tilde' more specifically applies to a loose organization of pubnixes with shared values and some cooperation around resources such as configuration, IRC network, and mutual assistance. 

The "tilde" (~) of the name alludes to the "Unix user folder" pattern of providing a default website to users at the server name prefixed with a tilde (~) and username (e.g. <em><nowiki>https://tilde.example.org/~username/</nowiki></em> )
