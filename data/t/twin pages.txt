'''<dfn>Twin pages</dfn>''' are cross-linked web pages seen in some [[digital garden]]s and personal [[wikis]] which point to similarly titled or directly related content on other sites. Often they're displayed as lists with links to other sites at the bottom of a page or in a footer much like comments sections, webmentions, lists of what links to this page/bi-directional links, or see also sections.


== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/ Bill Seitz] has been working at adding links to external sites to indicate twin pages and described some of his work here:  http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/2022-02-06-AddingSisterSites. He's developed some JavaScript that sister sites can add to display twin pages as well: http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/TwinPages

* [http://thoughtstorms.info/ Phil Jones] has twin pages functionality on his ThoughtStorms Wiki which is run on his Cardigan Bay wiki project

* [https://anagora.org/ Anagora] While not a traditional wiki, but really more of a federated wiki, Anagora aggregates and displays twin pages from multiple sites as a discovery or search related feature. As a result searching for a topic will show twin or related pages from the multitude of sites that Anagora crawls or has access to.

== Brainstorming ==
A [[discovery]] based service might aggregate and allow search of twin pages for users to cross-reference their own knowledge with that of others. Individual site owners can quickly see what their friends, colleagues, or others have written on a particular topic. 

If one has a list of sister sites, upon publishing a new wiki page, one could send [[webmentions]]/notifications to the other sites' related pages as a means of notification, updating, and/or display.


== Twin Pages ==
While the IndieWeb wiki doesn't have explicit twin pages functionality, the list below is [[manual until it hurts|manually generated]] to provide an additional example of the idea of twin pages.
