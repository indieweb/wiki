Request entered on the [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/good-first-effort-but-will-probably-not-use-it-for-now?replies=6#post-7936953 plugin support page] to include rel="syndication" and "class="u-syndication" on the link added on your self-hosted post back to Medium.

== Exporting your data ==
[https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214043918-Export-content Official documentation]. Export format is HTML of some kind (If you have done it, please expand with details!)

* go to https://medium.com/me/export
* click the export button
* wait for an email
* click the link to download a .zip file full of HTML documents
* these have a footer appended linking to the medium url that has the date exported
* they break embedded tweets and youtube videos,
* they replace external links with a redirect to a /r/?url= link that obviously doesn't work locally or on a server without you adding code

== Issues ==
=== buggy rel-canonical implementation ===
If you set the rel-canonical for a post on Medium using their API, it both fails to do so correctly, and then resets (via JS?) the rel=canonical link to a medium.com URL, not what you set it to.

* Details: https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs/issues/19

=== Downtime ===
* 2016-03-03 the homepage returned the [[HTTP 500]] error below. The link "interesting to read" was to https://medium.com/top-100, which also failed intermittently.

== Criticism ==
TO DO: cluster these by primary area of criticism and add subheads!

* 2014-05-30 [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-30/line/1401478311 Medium doesn't support footnotes]
* 2014-06-09 Medium does not appear to show the full published date in the visible content. Instead there is a [[The-Open-Graph-protocol|Open Graph Protocol]] meta element: <code>meta property="article:published_time" content="2014-01-16T08:59:18.300Z"</code>
** Example: https://medium.com/binary-times/use-your-own-product-or-die-ba3e2d738a55
** It appears that the year is displayed depending how recent the article is. A 2013 article linked above includes the year in the visible content, but as of this writing (2014-06), the example link only shows "Jan 16," because it is recently published, in the current year.
* 2014-07-23 Medium rolls out [https://medium.com/the-story/new-editor-features-title-images-and-more-5588495ec3c0 New Editor Features], marginalia comments are full of disappointment and criticism
