{{stub}}

'''"<dfn>It is considered</dfn>"''' or "<dfn>it is considered to be</dfn>" are forms of [[weasel wording]] (an [[antipattern]]) that is sometimes used in specifications[https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aietf.org+%22it+is+considered+to+be%22] to justify features or assertions that have little or no basis in actual citable evidence or real world examples, because if they did exist then such citations would be provided!

You may treat sentences that seriously (instead of ironically or as an example) start with
* "It is considered to be ..." 
as starting instead with 
* "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWyCCJ6B2WE The man behind the curtain] claims that it is ..."
