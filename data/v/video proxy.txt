{{stub}}

A <dfn>video proxy</dfn> is a service that fetches and re-serves videos from a new URL, similar to an [[image proxy]]. 

== Why ==
Similar to an [[image proxy]], you should use a video proxy to: 
* Avoid mixed content warnings when serving foreign videos
* Cache content that may disappear in the future
* Transcode or otherwise modifying videos before serving them to a client

==IndieWeb Examples==
=== Ryan Barrett ===
{{snarfed}} uses a [https://github.com/snarfed/misc/tree/main/caching-proxy custom caching proxy] on [https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/ facebook-atom] and [https://instagram-atom.appspot.com/ instagram-atom].

== Implementations==
* JavaScript ([https://workers.cloudflare.com/ CloudFlare worker]): https://github.com/snarfed/misc/tree/main/caching-proxy

== See Also ==
* [[image proxy]]
