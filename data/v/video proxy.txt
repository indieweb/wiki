A <dfn>video proxy</dfn> is a service that fetches and re-serves videos from a new URL, similar to an [[image proxy]]. This can be useful for various reasons: avoiding mixed content warnings when serving foreign videos, caching content that may disappear in the future, transcoding or otherwise modifying videos before serving them to a client.
