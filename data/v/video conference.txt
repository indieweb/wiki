A '''<dfn>video conference</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>video call</dfn>) is a way to [[call]] someone or multiple people; IndieWeb examples use a URL on a personal site for others to join and participate.

== How to ==
The methods you can take to implement video conferencing on your site include:

* Use Twilio Video or a similar service that manages the back-end for video and provides a high-level SDK to integrate video into your application. With this approach, you can build a custom front-end. However, hosted solutions may charge per call.
* Use an open-source tool like [https://mediasoup.org/ MediaSoup] to host your own front-end and back-end. You should look for Single Forwarding Unit (SFU) server technology as this scales better than peer-to-peer.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* {{capjamesg}} supports video conferencing on his personal website using MediaSoup for live video, Etherpad for taking notes and for real-time chat, and a custom back-end for administering rooms (create room, delete room, etc.).
