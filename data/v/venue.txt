A '''<dfn>venue</dfn>''' is a named [[location]] or address/[[geo]] that is typically used for [[checkins]].

<dfn>indieweb venues</dfn> are the practice of self-hosting checkin venues (<dfn>self hosted venues</dfn>) on your own site with your own URLs.

== Why ==
You should host your own venues with your own URLs for all the usual [[longevity]] reasons, but also to give yourself the freedom of defining new venues by your own experience, not just by someone else’s map.

== How to ==
__TOC__
=== How To Publish ===
Give each venue a URL containing a basic [[h-card]].  In this regard, a venue is kind of a special case of a [[wiki-page]] in that it is more of a timeless page than a post that has an explicit published date.

More "How to" TBD, see [[#Brainstorming]].

== Indieweb Examples ==
=== Barnaby Walters ===
{{barnabywalters}} has been publishing venue data on [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] since 2014-08-19, consisting of:
* an index of venues, listed and plotted on a map on [http://waterpigs.co.uk/places/ waterpigs.co.uk/places/]
* each venue has a URL with h-card containing name, address details, tags, map, review and URLs e.g. [http://waterpigs.co.uk/places/basilica-di-santa-maria-maggiore/ waterpigs.co.uk/places/basilica-di-santa-maria-maggiore/]
* A publicly-visible (soon-to-be-[[micropub]]-app) [http://waterpigs.co.uk/places/new/ venue creation UI] including a map UI with geolocation and venue search powered by [[Nominatim]]

=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has been publishing venues on gregorlove.com since 2015-11-12. Currently publishing each venue name, address, and URL with [[h-card]]. The [[event]]s I publish then link to this URL to indicate the location.
* Example: http://gregorlove.com/venues/mount-baker-theatre-bellingham/

=== rhiaro ===
{{rhiaro}} has been publishing 'venues' on at [http://rhiaro.co.uk/locations rhiaro.co.uk/locations] since 2015-12-29. They're not real places, but a list of vague places I check in to (home, office, etc). Only contain name and description. Marked up with h-cards but also available as ActivityStreams2 Collections in [http://rhiaro.co.uk/locations?format=json JSON-LD] and [http://rhiaro.co.uk/locations?format=ttl turtle]. My checkin app [https://apps.rhiaro.co.uk/burrow burrow] reads this list to present me with buttons to tap to check in.

=== Prototype Examples ===
IndieWeb sites publishing things resembling venues, but not quite separate venue posts yet.

==== Tantek ====
{{t}} started posting a photo and searchable permalink for "Horizontal Control Mark" physical placements on 2016-10-10:
* http://tantek.com/2016/284/t3/coyote-ridge-2-horizontal-control-mark
** name and photo of the physical mark
** information about lat/long and height

Related itches / use-cases:
* '''travel reminders''' - it can be particular useful to have your own easily refernceable an editable list of venues for any particular city you might travel, for the purposes of personal curation, places you want to see/try, or places you want to return to. Whether sites, museums, or cafes, restaurants, etc.

=== Past Examples ===
==== Kyle Mahan ====
{{warning|Kyle's site is now unfortunately a [[zombie]] site, so links have been replaced with archived versions}}
{{kylewm}} used [[Red Wind]] to publish venue data on kylewm.com from 2014-10-26 (and manually backported venues to older location-only checkins) [https://web.archive.org/web/20170323015740/https://kylewm.com/2016/01/moving-kylewmcom-to-known-indieweb until 2016-01-19] (archived), and then live again since 2016-???, e.g.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160914001428/https://kylewm.com/venues/mozilla-sf-san-francisco-california Archived example] <!-- https://kylewm.com/venues/mozilla-sf-san-francisco-california -->
[[File:redwind-venue-permalink-2015.png|700px]]

Consisting of venue properties:
* name
* "geo" - locality, region
* map
* list of links to other posts that reference that venue permalink, e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160317051625/https://kylewm.com/2014/08/at-mozilla-for-homebrew-website-club checkin] (archived) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20150919090503/https://kylewm.com/2015/04/homebrew-website-club-1 event] (archived) posts.

Red Wind maintains its own small database of venues ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160909140437/https://kylewm.com/venues archived example]). When creating a new checkin, it does a very simple exhaustive search to find the 10 nearest venues that have been checked into previously. e.g.,

** current silo workaround (and future possible syndication)
*** Foursquare tips attached to those venues. 
*** Indieweb transition strategy: import said Foursquare tips semi-automatically into indieweb venue URLs when said URLs exist and have rel-alternate URLs to equivalent Foursquare venues.

=== Micropub Query for Venues and Locations ===

A possible mp-venue query could be added to Micropub to support a client querying a site for venue URLs to display based on provided information(usually latitude, longitude, or keyword search).

=== Cross-site Venue Checkin UX Flow ===
# User A publishes a checkin on their indieweb site, with the venue marked up as an h-card (and possibly a link to a venue URI on the same site)
# User B is in the same area and sees the checkin. They decide to go to the same place.
# User B has a browser extension which parses checkin pages for h-card markup, and displays a “Check in to this venue on your site” button. They click it.
# User B is redirected to a form on their site for the creation of a new venue, auto-filled with information about the venue provided by the h-card
# User B checks in to their copy of the venue on their own site

Potential enhancements:

* Perform venue creation and checkin in the same step
** Example Implementation: automatically add machine tags to the checkin note with venue data, then have an event listener which picks up that the tagged venue doesn’t yet have a URI, and creates it
* Link between venue pages on separate sites
** Provides a decentralised yet consistent way to refer to a venue
** Could allow an update to a venue on one site to trigger updates on other sites

=== Opinions ===
<blockquote>I'd rather post a check-in on my own site, and have it use a venue URL that is *also* on my own site. Then at that indieweb venue URL, it can link to equivalents on Foursquare, OSM, FB, and whatever other centralized venue databases are created in the future. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2012-12-29#t1356810217] </blockquote>

=== Finding silo venue equivalent ===
How to find a silo venue URL equivalent, i.e. "How would you find the FB version of a venue?"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-01#t1441139504221]

Use-case: Using [[Bridgy]] Publish to [[POSSE]] an indieweb post with [[location]] information and have the location information propagate to the POSSE destination[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/317] (in particular [[Facebook]][https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/user/feed], and/or [[Twitter]][https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/update]

Possible solution:
* Your own venue URLs's representative h-card have u-url venue equivalent URLs for [[Foursquare]], Facebook, Twitter etc.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-01/line/1441139549972]
* Bridgy could read that representative h-card, see if any its u-urls were on the domain of the POSSE destination, if so, use it to determine the location information for the POSSE destination[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-01/line/1441139567867]

=== UI for venues with silo equivalents ===
The challenge is making a non-insane UI for [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-01/line/1441139584011]
* creating that original venue with links to silo equivalents
* publishing a [[check-in]] (or other post with location info) that itself must create a new original venue as well

Possible solutions:
* Start with "just add the markup to the text directly" UI[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-01/line/1441139610979]
* 90% case: import your [[Foursquare]] and [[Facebook]] checkin history and create indie venues for all silo venues from the import. Then since most of the time you visit where you've already been, this handles the indie venue / silo venue connection for that part.
* Interesting case: new venues

== Centralized venues ==
Examples:
* [[Foursquare]] venues
* Open Street Maps venues

=== Criticisms ===
==== Data loss ====
Experience with Foursquare's "community generated/patrolled venues database" is that a few griefers can pollute/damage the data quite badly, with deletions, overmergings etc. Sad to say, same thing happens with Wikipedia (excessive deletions, overmergings). Thus little hope that a "community hosted venues database" wouldn't have all the same problems, if not worse.
