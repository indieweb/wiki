A '''<dfn>venue category</dfn>''' is a label and or icon (or emoji) indicating the type of a [[venue]], usually from an explicit taxonomy of categories, sometimes a primary category among several categories.

== Why ==
If you publish venues either individually or in a list on your site for others to discover and use, by explicitly indicating the category or primary category and secondary categories of a venue, you make it easier for readers to scan for and look for the specific types of venues based on the what they are trying o accomplist.

=== How to publish ===
Publish the category or categories of a venue near the name of the venue, perhaps with an optional emoji instead of the name of the category.
