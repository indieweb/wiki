'''<dfn>vaporware</dfn>''' is a product that is announced before its release, often with no particular expected release date, or perhaps nothing even partially developed, and is an [[anti-pattern]].

The Twitter account [https://twitter.com/FemometerInc @FemometerInc] appears to be tweeting a lot (2015-10..11) saying "Something is coming"[https://twitter.com/FemometerInc/status/662763663778910208/] or other expectant phrases when there is no indication that anything specific is coming on their home page: http://www.femometer.com
