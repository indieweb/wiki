    '''<dfn>verify-me</dfn>''' is a browser extension that checks if [[rel-me]] links on the current page link back, and shows badges if they do.

== Extension {{tick}}==

The code for the plugin is [https://github.com/indieweb/verify-me on github]. You can install on [https://github.com/indieweb/verify-me/blob/master/verify-me.xpi Firefox] or [https://github.com/indieweb/verify-me/blob/master/verify-me.crx Chrome] from there. The plugin is also published in the [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/verify-me/nnefkajddpfponfnmaflddipljfdlcjb Chrome extension store].

<s>It uses the [[Indiewebify.me]] backend to check if links are bidirectional</s>

It now does the link checking using local fetches

* You should see a list of links at the right.

* click the green checkmark by the nav bar
* Gradually, green tickmarks{{tick}} will appear next to the links as the indiewebify callbacks complete.
* Click on one of the links, eg Twiitter or Github
