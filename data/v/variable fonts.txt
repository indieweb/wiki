A '''<dfn>variable font</dfn>''' is a font file that consolidates all styles available for a given font into a single font file, which usually decreases file size. This is in contrast to the usual practice of loading font files individually — one file for each font style. With variable font files, additional styles are mathematically interpolated between glyphs, which is one of the reasons why variable font files can be smaller than their static counterparts.

There are five registered axes upon which variable fonts can vary:

# Weight
# Width
# Italics
# Slant
# Optical size

Aside from those five registered axes, variable fonts can also contain custom axes — arbitrary stylistic spectrums along which the font can also transform. For example, a typographer using custom axes would be able to create a font variant that transforms and/or removes the serifs or the descenders in their font.
