{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Versioning</dfn>''' is the practice of keeping previous [[versions]] of a [[post]] or other item available (possibly through a record of [[edits]]). It may be useful for transparency, historical interest, or undoing changes.

== Why ==
For yourself: so you can view your own edit history.

For others: you may want to show others the edit history of your posts.

== How ==
(TBD)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Anyone using Git-based or other version controlled publishing software will have previous versions available.

* {{emmak}} using [[Skein]] on http://notenoughneon.com since 2016-05-19.
** Content is stored as static HTML + MF2 on S3, and mirrored on github.
** Posts and webmentions generate commits to https://github.com/notenoughneon/notenoughneon.github.io

* {{kevinmarks}} publishes a static site via github, so posts have edit history eg [https://github.com/kevinmarks/kevin-marks.com/commits/master/web/htmlversustex.html HTML vs TeX]

*{{snarfed}}  commits often change existing posts eg [https://github.com/snarfed/snarfed.org/commit/81d120de4981567cd3da055dc712b0196c8c2c9f this changes /beer, /books, /movies, and a few others]

== Software ==
=== MediaWiki ===
[[MediaWiki]] provides browsable version history of all pages and allows one to compare pairs of edits.

The only edits not easily browsable are page deletions.

=== WordPress ===

[[WordPress]] keeps a version history of posts and pages which is only viewable from the admin area unless exposed by a theme or plugin. [https://codex.wordpress.org/Revisions]

=== DokuWiki ===
[[DokuWiki]], like MediWiki, provides browsable version history of all pages and allows one to compare pairs of edits. The versions are stored as simple text files each representing a version of the page (optionally compressed) [https://www.dokuwiki.org/attic].

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has a little top-right corner dropdown menu for every post and comment you make that shows an "Edit Post" or "Edit Comment" option respectively, that when chosen allow you to edit that post/comment, save, and then shows an "Edited" greytext by the post which when clicked shows a version history of the post/comment from oldest to newest.

Dropdown menu:

Version history:

== Source Control Management ==

A SCM (Source Control Management) is typically used to maintain the history of changes in a codebase, but can be used for any kind of files, like the content of a blog. Popular SCMs are:

* [[Git]]
* [http://subversion.apache.org Subversion] (SVN)
* [https://www.mercurial-scm.org Mercurial]
