I've been looking into sending voice comments via [[webmentions]], the [http://www.opus-codec.org Opus codec] has become the default [[audio]] codec for the internet.

eg:
* 48Kh mono @ 8Kbits/sec 1:13:50 (H:MM:SS) filesize: 4.6 MB (4573796 bytes)
* 48Kh mono @ 8Kbits/sec 20:33 (MM:SS) filesize: 1.2 MB (1231171 bytes)

== History ==
=== early examples ===
* voice email

I remember plugins/addons for email clients that would allow you to record a message attachment(?)
I dont remember what audio codec they used (ADPCM?, realaudio?)

I also remember a application that would allow you to record a message
