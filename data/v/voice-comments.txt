I've been looking into sending voice comments via [[webmentions]], the [http://www.opus-codec.org Opus codec] has become the default audio codec for the internet.

== uses ==

* [[podcast]]
* hands free commenting
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology Assistive technology]?

== early examples ==
* voice email

I remember plugins/addons for email clients that would allow you to record a message attachment(?)
I dont remember what audio codec they used (ADPCM?, realaudio?)

I also remember a application that would allow you to record a message
