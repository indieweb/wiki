'''<dfn>WordPress</dfn>''' is open source blog software used by many on the indieweb as well as a blog hosting service.

* '''WordPress open source software''', available at http://wordpress.org
* [[WordPress.com]] blog hosting service (silo)

== Getting started ==
'''For a simple summary on getting started with Indieweb on your WordPress, see [[Getting Started on WordPress]].'''

== WordPress software ==
One of many IndieWeb [[Projects]], [http://wordpress.org WordPress] is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog. Estimates are that WordPress powers 20% of sites for which the content management server is identifiable. 

If you're interested in jumping into the IndieWeb, and you've  chosen WordPress as your tool of choice, great! Here are instructions that follow the step by step, ground up approach of [[IndieMark]].

As you complete each step, try plugging your site into [http://indiewebify.me/ indiewebify.me]. It will give you instant feedback, confirming that it's working or helping you fix it if not.

If you already have a WordPress site, you can add some of the elements below. 

If you do not have a site...We'll assume you already have your own [[personal-domain]]. After that, you'll need [[web-hosting]]. There are plenty of good options. [http://wpengine.com/ WPEngine] is one of the best for both beginners and advanced hackers. [[#WordPress.com hosting service]] is solid and easy to use, but limits you to pre-approved plugins and themes.

== Adding Indieweb Support/Elements to a WordPress Site ==

{{main|Getting Started on WordPress}}

Many people already have a WordPress site and want to enhance it. Here are steps/plugins to add IndieWeb support to a WordPress site.

=== Indieweb Plugin ===

The [https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ Indieweb Plugin] is a plugin that helps you install various Indieweb-themed plugins. It is designed for newcomers to quickly get up and running.

=== Examples ===

Individual articles bloggers have written about setting up their sites with indieweb support:
* 2014-08-30 http://techlifeweb.com/using-wordpress-for-indieweb/
* 2014-10-02 [https://david.shanske.com/2014/10/02/site-setup/ david.shanske.com]
* add yourself

== Security and Spam Protection ==

{{main|WordPress/Security}}

WordPress is a popular target for attacks and spam due to its popularity. It is important to keep your installation updated and take some basic steps to protect yourself.

== Plugins ==

{{main|WordPress/Plugins}}

There are many good WordPress plugins. Here are some recommended for Indieweb use and by Indieweb people.

== Themes ==

The safest place to download free themes is the [https://wordpress.org.themes/ official Wordpress Theme Directory]. A [https://web.archive.org/web/20131204234741/http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/why-you-should-never-search-for-free-wordpress-themes-in-google-or-anywhere-else/ 2011 study] found that almost every other source in the top 10 Google results contained malicious code (a [https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/free-wordpress-themes-ultimate-guide/ 2014 update] says the situation has improved but still recommends caution).

Once you have a theme, you'll want to add [[microformats]] 2 support if possible. 

Many services will also fall back to the original microformats standard, which many WordPress themes support.
Some themes support [[microformats]] or other semantics. Microformats 2 is not supported by WordPress or the majority of WordPress themes. 

* [https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress SemPress] supports microformats, microformats2 and schema.org (theme). It is the only complete theme with microformats2 support.
* [http://p2theme.com/ P2] is a microblog theme for WordPress that might be adaptable for indiewebsters.
* [https://github.com/dshanske/mf2_s MF2_s] is a starter theme forked from [https://underscores.me Underscores] a popular starter theme. It is under active development with the hopes it will form the basis of future themes.

Rather than a theme [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 uf2] is a plugin that attempts to add microformats2 data to an existing theme though as the author admits it is very limited and recommends using a theme that supports microformats natively.

== Development ==

{{main|WordPress/Development}}

Several projects are actively under development for use in WordPress. Plugins/themes considered complete enough for widespread use  will appear on this page. 

For common conventions of data storage in WordPress to ensure interoperability, see [[WordPress_Data|WordPress Data]].

For brainstorming on development of Indieweb themes/plugins for WordPress and discussion of common conventions to ensure interoperability, see [[WordPress/Development|WordPress Development]].

There are several efforts to add Indieweb Elements to WordPress Core and related projects.

* Add Microformats2 Support https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30783
* Improve Linkback Presentation https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32653
* Remove hentry from _s(WordPress Starter Theme) - https://github.com/Automattic/_s/pull/860

Also, the next WordPress theme, Twenty-Sixteen, will have proper use of hfeed and hentry and remove the theme dependence on styling these elements.

== People using WordPress ==

{{main|WordPress/Examples}}

People using WordPress on their primary or other sites as well as people who formerly used WordPress.

== Criticism ==
<span id="Problems">Problems</span> with and criticism of using WordPress software from an IndieWeb perspective.

=== Complexity ===
The apparent complexity of using and maintaining WordPress has gotten bad enough (or people have gotten tired of it enough) to make people write plain HTML instead[https://twitter.com/psygnisfive/status/570787368158007296] <blockquote>@kevinmarks @t ive resorted to writing blog posts by hand (html and all!) because i hate wordpress. been looking into hakyll tho</blockquote>

=== Jetpack Requires Login ===
<span id="Jetpack">[[Jetpack]]</span> is a popular plugin that incorporates a large number of features and services from WordPress.com into a self-hosted WordPress site. 

The plugin requires a wordpress.com login. While the service provided, such as their stats service, would require a login, many of the plugin features, such as infinite scroll, contact form, etc do not. But to use any of the features, you must log in.

=== Security and Maintenance Vulnerability ===

{{main|WordPress/Security}}

Like any system with widespread adoption, WordPress is a target. It is important to keep your site updated with the latest version of the software and any plugins. WordPress has a limited automatic update system.

=== Fatal Error memory exhausted ===
WordPress seems to run out of memory on servers sometimes, and give a message like:

* e.g. on http://yottabytes.info/?p=10497 (on 2014-06-08 15:28 EDT): <blockquote> Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 41943040 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 32 bytes) in /home/johnkrol/public_html/wp-includes/post.php on line 1961</blockquote>

=== Pages can not have numeric slugs ===
WordPress does not allow numeric page slugs, making it difficult to set up pages representing a year, such as <code>/event/2014/</code>. This is frustrating if you need to set up a series of annually recurring pages (not blog posts) without using a plugin. [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11917]

== POSSE to WordPress ==
With WordPress's API it's possible to automatically <span id="POSSE">[[POSSE]]</span> posts to it, and there's at least one example of an indieweb community member doing so to the hosted service: [[WordPress#POSSE_to_hosted|POSSE to hosted]]

=== POSSE reply to WordPress ===
It's possible to post a reply to a WordPress blog post on your own site, and then POSSE your reply to the WordPress blog post's comments section, as well as POSSE your reply with threading to anywhere that WordPress blog post itself was POSSEd to, e.g. Twitter.

Indie Web Examples:
==== Tantek reply POSSE ====
{{t}} has started experimenting with manually POSSEing reply posts to WordPress blogs to their comment sections. E.g.:
* original reply: http://tantek.com/2014/255/t2/well-deserved-talented-known-minor-correction
* manual POSSE comment: https://gigaom.com/2014/09/11/indieweb-advocates-launch-known-so-bloggers-can-be-social-and-still-control-their-content/#comment-1483187
** related: [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request to [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/271 Publish to WordPress comments] which could help automate this!
* semi-automatic POSSE tweet @-reply: https://twitter.com/t/status/510633038062309376
** only *semi* automatic because I had to dig up the in-reply-to tweet permalink manually, but then the [[POSSE]] copy of my reply and tweet threading was handled automatically by [[Falcon]].

==== aaronpk ====
{{aaronpk}} occasionally manually POSSEs reply posts to the comments section of WordPress blogs. E.g.:
* original reply: http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2015/01/13/2/indie
* semi-automatic tweet reply: https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/555106750433869824 (not fully automatic because required finding the @gigaom tweet permalink manually)
* manual POSSE comment: https://gigaom.com/2015/01/13/ind-ie-scales-back-focuses-on-heartbeat-social-networking-client/#comment-1513998

== WordPress.com hosting service ==

Wordpress.com is a blog hosting service that runs the WordPress open source software.
