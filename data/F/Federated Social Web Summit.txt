The '''<dfn>Federated Social Web Summit</dfn>''' was an annual event from 2010-2012.

== Portland 2010 ==
The first Federated Social Web Summit (FSWS) was held on [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/FedAll2010/Announcement 2010-07-18] (FSWS2010) in Portland, Oregon organized primarily by [[StatusNet]] (Evan Prodromou and Jon Phillips in particular).

The event was invitation-only, however the barrier to receive an invitation was quite low.

=== Inspired IndieWebCamp ===
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] and [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Çelik]] both participated in FSWS2010 and from that event were inspired to co-found '''IndieWebCamp''', starting with the Freenode #indiewebcamp [[IRC]] channel and [[Main_Page|the wiki]]. Aaron and Tantek used IRC and the wiki to organize [[2011|IndieWebCamp 2011]] along with additional co-founders [[User:Caseorganic.com|Amber Case]] and [http://skinnywhitegirl.com Crystal Beasley].

== Berlin 2011 ==
The second Federated Social Web Summit was held 2011-06-03…05 in Berlin, Germany and organized by the W3C Federated Social Web Interest Group.

It was organized in the tradition of W3C workshops with a [https://web.archive.org/web/20111106013834/http://d-cent.org:80/fsw2011/about/cfp/ CFP], white-paper submissions etc. but again with [https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/FSWE2011_-_Sent_Invitations explicit invitations to several projects and groups].

== San Francisco 2012 ==
The third Federated Social Web Summit ([http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/Federated_Social_Web_Summit_2012 FSWS2012]) was a one day event held in San Francisco, California on 2012-10-26 and organized by the W3C Federated Social Web Community Group.

This summit was also invitation-only for implementers[http://www.w3.org/community/fedsocweb/2012/10/01/federated-social-web-summit-2012-in-san-francisco/], however, quite "knockable", that is, merely asking for an invitation and providing a reasonable statement of interest (why you should be there) would result in receiving an invitation.

Numerous IndieWebCamp [[2011]] and [[2012]] participants attended and spoke at FSWS2012.

The use of <code>[[h-as]]-*</code> class names for explicit [[posts]] typing using [[ActivityStreams]] object types appears to have started at this summit[https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/Federated_Social_Web_Summit_2012/notes#as-mf2], which have subsequently been '''[[h-as|discouraged]]'''.

Other pages created on same wiki as FSWS2012 for attempts related to FSWS discussions:
* [https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SOCML_Proposal SOCML Proposal] - defunct attempt at an XML format (like [[Atom]], but completely new) that attempted to "standardize social media content such that independent developers can create their own services that can share and aggregate data under a common standard"

== 2013 ==
There was no Federated Social Web Summit in 2013. 

The closest thing to it was [[2013/osfw3c]], AKA:
* [[2013/osfw3c|W3C Workshop on Social Standards: The Future of Business]]

== 2014 ==
There was no Federated Social Web Summit in 2014 (nor any subsequent year)

The W3C Launched the [https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg Social Web Working Group] which subsequently standardized a bunch of IndieWeb [[building blocks]] such as [[Webmention]], [[Micropub]], [[WebSub]], and published notes for [[Post Type Discovery]], [[IndieAuth]] and closed in early 2018.

The phrase "Federated Social Web" was rarely used thereafter.

== Domain redirect and loss ==
The domain federatedsocialweb.net was redirected at some point (when?) to https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/ and eventually the federatedsocialweb.net was abandoned and then squatted by an unrelated entity.

Links starting with http: or https: to <code>federatedsocialweb.net/</code> can be [[autolink]]ed to <code>https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/</code> with the remainder of their path.
