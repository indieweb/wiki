'''<dfn>Flash</dfn>''' is in the context of the web a reference to [[Adobe]] Flash, typically Adobe Flash Player, which is a waning proprietary platform and [[browser]] plug-in for content and application distribution, ages ago on independent sites, more recently on embedded systems like gas station kiosks like https://twitter.com/moenig/status/1030490221392142338 (see screenshots therein).
