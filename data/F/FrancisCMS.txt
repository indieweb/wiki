'''<dfn>[https://github.com/FrancisCMS FrancisCMS]</dfn>''' is an IndieWeb-friendly content management system built with [[Ruby on Rails]]. It was conceived and is maintained by {{jgarber}}.

== History ==

FrancisCMS began life on 2014-10-07 as a [[Sinatra]] application (hence [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra the name]) before becoming a Rails application before becoming a mountable [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html Rails engine].
__TOC__
At present, FrancisCMS is a white label Rails engine meant to be included in an existing Rails application at a particular mount point (<code>/</code>, for instance). FrancisCMS provides models, controllers, and views for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete CRUD]-ing supported content types. The host Rails application is responsible for providing a user [[authentication]] system, styles with [[CSS]], and behavior with [[JavaScript]]. FrancisCMS also exposes a number of useful methods, helpers, and configuration variables available for use in the host Rails application.

== Features ==

* Supports multiple content types ([[posts]], [[links]], and [[photos]]) with [[drafts]], [[tags]], and [[RSS]] feeds.
* Supports syndicating content types to several third-party [[silos]].
* Receives and verifies [[webmentions]], displaying verified webmentions on content pages.
* Provides alternative representations of content types as [[Markdown]] and [[jf2]]-formatted [[JSON]].
* Inherits styling (CSS) and scripting (JavaScript) from the host Rails application.
* Delegates authentication to the host Rails application.
