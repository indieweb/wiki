'''<dfn>Facebook Page</dfn>''' is a form of identity on [[Facebook]] that has its own profile like other identities, and a set of administrators who can take action on Facebook as the identity of that Facebook Page.

== Examples ==
* https://www.facebook.com/indiewebcamp/ - Facebook Page for the IndieWebCamp community

Other examples include brands, companies, etc.

== Features ==
Facebook Page features are similar to but expanded beyond what a Facebook user can do with their own profile.

=== Events ===
One particularly useful feature of Facebook Pages is the ability create and post public [[Event]] posts as that page, and then administrate those events with other page admins.

This is often done for the [[POSSE]] copy of IndieWebCamp related events such as [[Homebrew Website Club]] meetups, and [[IndieWebCamps]] themselves as well!

Bridgy backfeed can support backfeeding the [[RSVP]]s from these page created events to indie events.

Apparently a Facebook Page can also create an event as a draft, and schedule it to be published later per the blue pop-up message in the above screenshot: <blockquote>Now you can save an event as a draft and schedule when it's published</blockquote>

=== Pages Feed ===

One of the more confusing features of Pages are the ability to like other Pages as that Page, and then see a "Pages Feed" of posts from those liked pages. Facebook encourages use of this feature with the blue side-pop message in the above screenshot: <blockquote>Stay up to date with Pages you've liked as your Page.</blockquote>

==== Empty Pages Feed ====

If your page has not liked any pages yet, you get a kind of confusing display of no posts.
