== History ==
Fastmail was acquired by [[Opera]] in 2010, then spun back out in 2013, when the original developers bought the service back from Opera.[http://blog.fastmail.com/2013/09/25/exciting-news-fastmail-staff-purchase-the-business-from-opera/]

At some point Fastmail acquired Pobox.com and has merged them.[https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/9822848635919-Guide-to-Fastmail-for-Pobox-users]
