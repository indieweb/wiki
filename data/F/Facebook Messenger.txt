{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Facebook Messenger</dfn>''' is [[Facebook]]â€™s direct [[messaging]] feature on their website, and also a separate [[native]] application for [[iOS]] and [[Android]] that is known to provide [[#Vague_and_generic_updates_explanations|meaningless wordy update summaries]].

== Why ==
Why use Facebook Messenger?

Facebook Messenger:
* is device & OS independent, and 
* can be run on multiple devices simultaneously, 
* which makes it more flexible than [[SMS]], and 
* more broadly supported than [[iMessage]].
* It also has a URL scheme for providing a one click [[contact]] button.

== Criticism ==
=== Vague and generic updates explanations ===
Facebook Messenger, at least for iOS, seems to be updated quite often (weekly?), rarely for any specific reason, providing only a frustratingly generic and opaque update [[release notes]] like:
<blockquote>We update the app regularly so we can make it better for you. Get the latest version for all of the available features and improvements. Thanks for using Messenger!</blockquote>
