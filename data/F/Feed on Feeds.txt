'''<dfn>[https://github.com/RomanSixty/Feed-on-Feeds/ Feed on Feeds]</dfn>''' is a self-hosted PHP-based feed reader. It supports the following:

* [[Atom]] and [[RSS]] feeds
* Multiple users
* Basic item re-sharing
* [[WebSub]]
* Silo-specific support for [[Reddit]] and [[YouTube]]
* An "inbox"-style view, with accessibility-minded keyboard shortcuts
* SQLite, Postgres, or MySQL for the database

It was originally written by Steve Minutillo in 2006 but was abandoned in 2011 or so; afterwards several parallel efforts took place to resuscitate it, with the current one being handled primarily by [https://github.com/RomanSixty Alexander Schulze], {{beesbuzz.biz}}, and [https://github.com/thylacine Justin Wind].
