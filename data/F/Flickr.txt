'''<dfn>[http://flickr.com Flickr]</dfn>''' is a [[photo]] and [[video]] hosting [[silo]] founded in 2004.

== Why ==
=== Why POSSE ===
__TOC__
Why POSSE to Flickr in particular?

* {{t}}: I noticed that my Flickr photos get [https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/tags/press some notable re-use] due to better discoverability of Flickr photos, and CC licensing. Thus to encourage more notable re-use, I am POSSEing my photos to Flickr, and selectively make them public.

== How to ==
=== How to export your data ===
There are various tools for exporting your photos, comments, tags, and favorites from Flickr. Please document such tools here.

==== Direct Export ====
From one's [https://www.flickr.com/account account page], Flickr offers a one-click tool that will email you a link for data download. 

<blockquote>You can use this tool to download the information that Flickr has about your account, including account preferences, profile information, and your photos and videos. This process will take some time, so we’ll send you an email when it’s ready for you to download.</blockquote>

==== Using Flickr Camera Roll ====
This method exports the photos only, no meta information like tags and albums. Open https://www.flickr.com/cameraroll and you should see all of your photos. You can click-and-drag to select multiple photos. At the bottom of the page will be options for the selected photos. Click "Download" and you will be prompted to save a zip file of the selected photos. If you select a large amount of photos, it may automatically break them into separate zip files. I exported 841 photos on 2016-02-23 and it made two zip files. {{gRegor}}

==== Flickr Archiver ====
See {{aaronpk}}'s https://github.com/aaronpk/Flickr-Archiver

==== flickr-cli ====
[https://github.com/TheFox/flickr-cli flickr-cli] by TheFox is a command-line PHP tool for uploading and downloading Flickr items. It's download function has an option to download all of a user's original files and save their metadata in [[YAML]] files.

==== Feeds ====
Flickr has numerous [[feeds]] to views of content that can be used to [[PESOS]] content from Flickr, or to backup recent content.

===== tag feeds =====
Flickr has publicly readable feeds of tagged photos: (e.g. photos tagged with "indiewebcamp")
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=indiewebcamp&lang=en-us&format=atom

===== user feeds =====
Flickr's feeds related to a specific user by opaque userid in the URL are also public, e.g. for userid 39039882@N00 (user: http://flickr.com/tantek ) :

photo/video posts from a user: 
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom
favorites of a user: 
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_faves.gne?nsid=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom
photos of a user: (people tagged)
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/profile_photos.gne?nsid=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom

===== activity feed =====
Flickr has a (totally undocumented?) feed of activity for the logged in user, where activity is anything you would normally be notified about in notifications (faves, comments, replies to photos you have replied on). To limit content to only photos in your own stream, add &activity_view=photostream

* https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/activity/all?user_id=me
* https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/activity/all?user_id=me&activity_view=photostream

These require you to be logged in and redirect to a "secret" URL and may include activity on non-public photos.

===== WordPress Tool =====
2019-02-20 Chris Hardie [https://chrishardie.com/2019/02/moving-photos-flickr-wordpress/ wrote up] how he used his own custom tool to export from Flickr and import into his own [[WordPress]] blog. The code is available on Github: [https://github.com/ChrisHardie/flickr-to-wordpress Flickr Export to WordPress Import] with reasonable instructions.

=== How to POSSE ===
You can POSSE the following to Flickr:
* [[photo]]s
* [[video]]s
* [[reply]] posts as comments on Flickr photos/videos (including POSSE reply-threading, when you reply to an indie photo/video that has a Flickr POSSE copy).
* [[like]] posts as favorites on Flickr photos/videos (including POSSE favoriting, when you like an indie photo/video that has a Flickr POSSE copy).

==== Bridgy Publish POSSE ====
You can use [[Bridgy]] Publish to POSSE to Flickr [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/432 since 2015-11-15] the following kinds of [[posts]]:
* photos, videos, comments, and favorites. Photos may include [[tags]] (supported [https://github.com/snarfed/granary/commit/235faa2adf36c5e0546929ed4bfc3584dd8f52f6 since 2016-01-08]) and/or [[person-tag|people tags]].

Feature request for POSSEing [[tag-reply]] posts:
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/857 #857]: [http://tantek.com/2019/007/b1/bridgy-support-tag-reply-flickr support POSSEing tag reply to Flickr]

=== How to backfeed from ===
If you POSSE to Flickr, you should [[backfeed]] all the responses to your Flickr POSSE copies. E.g.
* Flickr favorite -> [[like]]
* Flickr comment -> [[reply]]

==== Bridgy Backfeed ====
You can use Bridgy to backfeed favorites & comments from Flickr POSSE copies back to their originals [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/225 since 2015-09-17].

Feature requests for backfeeding taggings:
* [[tag-reply]]: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/776
* [[person-tag]]s: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/488

=== IndieWeb POSSE backfeed examples ===

==== Ben Werdmuller ====
{{benwerd}} with [[Known]] on werd.io [http://werd.io/2014/homebrew-website-club-noir-at-mattervc-photo-by-museyapp-indieweb since at least 2014-07-17] (fairly certain there are much earlier examples, thus leaving benwerd at top of list)
* original photo post: http://werd.io/2014/homebrew-website-club-noir-at-mattervc-photo-by-museyapp-indieweb
* POSSE Copy: https://www.flickr.com/photos/benwerd/14671472684/
==== Jeremy Keith ====

** automatic Flickr POSSE copy: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/24140238323/
*** all hashtags in original made it through to Flickr POSSE copy via <code>p-category</code> and Bridgy Publish support

** manual (via Bridgy Publish) Flickr POSSE copy: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/24235088549/
*** revealed: "a video" text at start of caption (likely from video tag fallback) - [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/612 Bridgy #612] (subsequently fixed)
*** revealed: # hashtags in caption did not make it to Flickr tags automatically (added manually afterwards)
**** fixed by marking them up as p-category in subsequent photo/video posts.

== Features ==
Summary of Flickr's features:
* account creation / management like typical silos
* [[photo]] and [[video]] posts
** [[favorite]] and [[comment]] on those posts
* [[post by email]]
* ...
* ... lots more features

Details of some specific features are provided in sections below.

=== Privacy ===
==== Location data has different privacy settings from the photos ====
Photos on Flickr have a privacy setting for seeing the photo itself, and a separate privacy setting for viewing the location of the photo. For example it is possible to set a photo to public, but have the location only visible to "Friends and Family".

==== Geofencing ====
Flickr allows you to configure one or more geofences around locations such as "home" or "work", and any time photos are uploaded that fall into that area, the geo privacy will be set automatically.[http://blog.flickr.net/2011/08/30/introducing-geofences-on-flickr/]

== Brainstorming ==
=== How to delete your account ===
TBD.

Has anyone deleted their Flickr account? What's the process? How long do they hold your data anyway? Etc.

See also: [[delete your account]]

== Issues ==
=== PESOS unreliability ===
There has been some experience with a [[PESOS]] approach not working well with Flickr:
* [https://twitter.com/anomalily/status/518830141502685185 2014-10-05 @anomalily] <blockquote>Whoa, leveling up in the #indieweb world: about to switch from PESOS to POSSE for @flickr because PESOS is failing me</blockquote>

Recommendation: [[POSSE]] to Flickr instead of PESOS.

=== Two Pages About You ===
Users on Flickr have two pages "about" them:
* /photos/username (also often works at just /username) - no link to your website, but shows your stream of recent photo [[posts]], and has a [[rel-me]] link to your /people/username page:
* /people/username - has [[rel-me]] support for linking back to your website. Shows a few recent photo thumbnails, recent photos of your, your recent favorites.

No other service splits your profile identity like this. Typical [[silos]] all have integrated profile pages that show <em>both</em> your latest posts and your profile information like your website.

Because of this, and because Flickr encourages linking to the /photos/username page, getting rel=me to work with Flickr is a bit more out-of-the-way work, but still doable.

== Criticism ==
* [http://blog.flickr.net/en/2015/05/07/flickr-camera-roll/ version 4.0 of the Flickr smartphone app] now auto-syncs every picture and video by default, without asking, which raises serious privacy issues

* Photo embed code requires Javascript (for the slideshow player) to even display any image. ( see http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-03-22#t1427012080693 )

== Downtime ==
* [https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157652568890216/page4/ "Upload failures"] a.k.a. untested impact of new features

* 2007-02-19 Flickr massage: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/420426227/ http://farm1.staticflickr.com/186/420426227_dda4d24789_o.png]


== Other uses == 
* {{petermolnar}} ended up using [https://petermolnar.net/how-to-export-flickr-to-a-gpx-file-to-geotag-photos/ Flickr as a geotagging software] due to it's relatively sophisticated drag-and-drop map organizer and to the lack of similar in linux land. The short summary is that once POSSEd photos are placed on the map in Flickr, this information can be exported and added to the local image file itself.

== History ==
(stub section)
* Flickr originally only supported photo posts
* When Flickr added [[video]] posts they were limited to short (max 90sec) & small (max 150MB)
* Bought by [[SmugMug]] 2018-04
