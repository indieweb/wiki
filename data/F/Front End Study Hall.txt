== FAQ == 
=== '''When?''' ===
* Every two weeks or so, see [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/fresh events.indieweb.org/tag/fresh] and subscribe to the [https://events.indieweb.org/ics/tag/fresh/preview iCal feed]
=== '''Do you talk about things like React?''' ===
* React and anything reliant on JavaScript ''(or TypeScript, or other higher level programming languages)'' are outside the focus for FrESH. We often have strong opinions about frameworks, libraries, tools, editors, libraries, tutorials.
=== '''Some commonly discussed topics?'''===
* [[accessibility]] or a11y, [[CSS]], [[HTML]], [[RSS]], [[audio]], [[SVG]], [[blogroll]], [[fonts]], [[design]] concepts, getting started
