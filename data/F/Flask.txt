{{stub}}
<dfn>'''[http://flask.pocoo.org/ Flask]'''</dfn> is a minimal [[Python]] framework for writing web applications. It provides regex-based URL routing, templating via Jinja2, and request/response handling. Additional functionality is provided via extensions (e.g., ORM via Flask-SQLAlchemy). Because of its minimalism and flexibility, Flask is popular for writing API endpoints for larger applications.

== Why ==

There are a few reasons why you might want to use Flask for a website project:

* Flask contains an extensive range of features that aid web development.
* Flask is well documented.
* It is comparatively easy to get a web application set up with Flask. It only takes a few lines of code to start rendering a HTML template.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{kylewm}}'s [[Red Wind]] is built on Flask
* {{beesbuzz.biz}}'s [[Publ CMS|Publ]] is built on Flask
* {{capjamesg}} uses Flask for many of his IndieWeb projects, including his webmention receiver and Micropub endpoint.
** [[IndieWeb Search]], whose development is led by {{capjamesg}} uses two Flask apps: one for the public web application and another for interfacing with the Elasticsearch server on which the engine is based.
