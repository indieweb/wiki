'''<dfn>FeedBurner</dfn>''' is a service that aggregates [[feeds]], provides analytics to publishers, caches their feeds, and has an optional email feature to deliver posts as emails to subscribers.

FeedBurner was purchased by [[Google]] which now calls it "Google FeedBurner".

== How to ==
=== How to redirect your feed ===
As of 2013-08-14, Google made an interesting change to Feedburner that makes it easier for a site to take back its feed. In the past, Feedburner would redirect requests to a deleted feed to the original one for 1 month. It now offers a permanent redirection, which makes <span id="Leaving_Feedburner">leaving</span> easier.

Once permanent redirection is selected, site authors should add a header or footer to their feed in order to advertise the new address at least during the first months, to let their subscribers change the address in their feed readers.

To remove your feed from Feedburner, login into your Feedburner console, select the feed to remove, and click on "delete".

Before submitting, don't forget to check the "With permanent redirection" checkbox.

<img src="https://indieweb.org/images/4/4a/2021-04-14-feedburner-announcement.png" style="max-width:20%;float:right" alt="Google FeedBurner transition email screenshot" />
On 2012-10-20 Google shutdown FeedBurner APIs (per https://developers.google.com/feedburner/ ).

On 2021-04-14, Google emailed current users the following information (pictured in screenshot) about newly announced feature shutdowns:

<blockquote>
FeedBurner has been a part of Google for almost 14 years, and we’re making several upcoming changes to support the product’s next chapter. Here’s what you can expect to change and what you can do now to ensure you’re prepared.

Starting in July, we are transitioning FeedBurner onto a more stable, modern infrastructure. This will keep the product up and running for all users, but it also means that we will be turning down most non-core feed management features, including email subscriptions, at that time.

For those who use FeedBurner email subscriptions, we recommend downloading your email subscribers so that you can migrate to a new email subscription service.

For many users, no action is required. All existing feeds will continue to serve uninterrupted, and you can continue to create new accounts and burn new feeds. Core feed management functionality will continue to be supported, such as the ability to change the URL, source feed, title, and podcast metadata of your feed, along with basic analytics.
</blockquote>

== Criticism ==
=== Lack of HTTPS support ===
Feedburner fails to consume [[https]] URLs to [[RSS]] feeds: <blockquote>After updating my configuration to have it use my https URL – in case it was unable to follow a 301 redirect – I was surprised to notice Feedburner was throwing a 400 Bad Request error. Despite Google guidelines promoting the use of HTTPS, Feedburner, a Google service is unable to handle it.[https://t37.net/if-you-haven-t-dropped-feedburner-yet-this-mind-blowing-reason-will-convince-you-to-do-it.html]</blockquote>
