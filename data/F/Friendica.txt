<dfn>[http://friendica.com/ Friendica]</dfn> is an open source, federated social platform that aims to federate with many other networks (silo and indie alike). 

== Selfdogfooding ==

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* Add yourself...

== IndieWeb Compatibility ==
* As of 2016-06-21, the development branch has threads marked up with microformats2 thanks to {{benthatmustbeme}}. [https://github.com/friendica/friendica/pull/2630 Pull Request] 
* There is an open [https://github.com/friendica/friendica/issues/1260 Feature Request] for adding [[IndieAuth]] support.
* There is an open [https://github.com/friendica/friendica/issues/3092 Feature Request] for adding [[webmention]] support.

=== Issues ===
* Comments, while having their own URL, render nearly identical output html.  Thus comment URLs currently have the original post of a thread as the h-entry, not the comment. 
* Comments canonical URL are also not on the author's domain, thus could be forged (for microformats consumers)

== Screenshots ==
