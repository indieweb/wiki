=== Issues ===
* Comments, while having their own URL, render nearly identical output html.  Thus comment URLs currently have the original post of a thread as the h-entry, not the comment. 
* Comments canonical URL are also not on the author's domain, thus could be forged (for microformats consumers)

== Screenshots ==
