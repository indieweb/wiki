== Features ==
It was a [[Google Reader]]-style feed reader written in [[PHP]]. It had a one-time fee of $30 and only worked on a single domain due to built-in DRM. It had some interesting "sparks and trends" features which de-duped articles in order to create a "fever" view of links that many articles link to.

The [http://web.archive.org/web/20161217042229/http://feedafever.com/api FeverAPI] (archived) was still used in many feed readers as a sync endpoint. It was available as an option in [[Unread]] on iOS, [http://readkitapp.com ReadKit] on macOS and [[Reeder]] on Mac and iOS, for example.

For use as a syncing backend, fever is supported in some self-hosted RSS readers/aggregators like [[Miniflux]], [https://github.com/swanson/stringer stringer],  [https://github.com/pietheinstrengholt/rssmonster RssMonster], and as a plugin for [[Tiny Tiny RSS]]. This allows the user to avail of the fever-api reading capability of the above apps.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Past ===
* {{bret}} - I used to run fever until malformed feeds hosed the backend DB. It has a single developer, has a non-open source license, contains many bugs and never gets updated.  Do not recommend especially with all the other options these days.
