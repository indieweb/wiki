=== How to export your data ===
Update: For the most current steps and techniques for exporting all your content from Facebook and importing to your own site, see:
* https://cleverdevil.io/2018/freeing-myself-from-facebook

Or check out the individual steps:

You can <span id="Exporting_your_data">export your data</span> on Facebook by:
* Go to: https://www.facebook.com/settings
* Click the "Download a copy" link at the bottom of the text
* See the table on https://www.facebook.com/help/405183566203254 for what data is included in the downloaded data

To export all photos in an album owned by others (such as all photos in which you are tagged):
* http://iangreenleaf.github.io/facebook_photos/

To export Facebook messages:
* http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/01/psa-back-up-your-shit/. This is complicated to set up and has some limitations.
* [https://github.com/RaghavSood/FBMessageScraper Facebook Message Scraper]

Previously, [[Freedom.io]] could be used to copy Facebook posts. It is no longer maintained or recommended, but is available as an open source project.

[http://fb.textile.photos/ Textile] provides a service for massaging one's Facebook exported photos to put them back into galleries.

=== How to <span id="Migrating">migrate</span> off of ===
If you'd like to move off of Facebook entirely, consider trying out {{cleverdevil}}'s [[ditchbook]] project, which is an [https://github.com/cleverdevil/ditchbook open source toolkit] for migrating Facebook export data to any [[Micropub]] compatible website. While ditchbook has been used to migrate a few people's Facebook content to their websites, it is currently flagged as experimental.

=== How to <span id="Weaning">wean</span> yourself from ===
If you’re looking to reduce your usage of Facebook, you may find that incrementally doing so (as opposed to doing a cold-turkey [[silo-quit]]) may be easier.

Here are some steps to take.

<ol start=0><li>'''Delete the Facebook native app.''' Use https://m.facebook.com/ instead, or https://mbasic.facebook.com/ for a no-JavaScript experience, including access to discussions in [[Facebook Messenger]].</li></ol>
# '''Use https://facebook.com/events/calendar''' instead of facebook.com'''
#* Goal: stop checking Facebook's News Feed (for all the reasons given in [[#Criticism]]).
#** IndieWeb folks doing this: {{t}}
#** Previously: fb.com/events - which now distracts you with "suggested events" at the top. /events/calendar shows you events you've RSVPd to or been invited to, and birthdays. More focused than /events
#* Still allows:
#** going to events organized on FB (seeing invitations, responding etc.)
#** seeing current birthdays (today, yesterday, tomorrow)
#** checking Friending activity (toolbar person outline icon)
#** checking Message activity (toolbar talk bubble icon)
#** checking Notifications (toolbar globe icon)
# '''Use https://m.facebook.com/events/calendar''' on weekend only, only on [[mobile]]
#* Goal: quickly check what events are coming up just for weekends (mobile web is faster to load / view than fb.com/events)
#* Goal: be even less distracted by all the other UI elements
#* Specifically avoid:
#** checking Notifications (toolbar alarm icon)
#* IndieWeb folks doing this: {{t}}
# '''Use your profile URL https://facebook.com/me''' instead
#* Goal: be even less compelled to be distracted than even just checking events
#** IndieWeb folks doing/trying this: {{t}} (since 2018-01-22 for ~3 days)
#* Still allows:
#** check your POSSE copies on FB
#** checking Message activity (toolbar talk bubble icon)
#* Specifically avoid:
#** checking Notifications (toolbar globe icon)
#* Optionally
#** minimize Friending activity (toolbar person outline icon), perhaps check/add only once a day/week?
# '''Take a week+ "off the grid"''' vacation during which you're unable to check Facebook notifications
#* Goal: stop checking Facebook notifications (toolbar globe icon)
#** IndieWeb folks who have done this: 
#*** {{t}} 2016-08-07 for ~1 week, 2017-08-01 for ~1.5 weeks, 2018-01-14 for 7+ months, by being off Facebook the website completely for a week, still using FB Messenger app for comms, and then procrastinating checking notifications since

=== How to POSSE to ===
{{main|POSSE to Facebook}}

There are <span id="POSSE_out_to">multiple ways to [[POSSE]]</span> out ''some'' things from your indieweb site to your Facebook profile. Specifically, you can POSSE posts and event RSVPs, but [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/350 as of the 2.x Facebook API, ''not'' comments or likes.] Comments and likes [https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourresponses#facebook can't be PESOSed either.]

Existing techniques:

==== from Twitter ====
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] POSSEs [[notes]], [[articles]] by name + permalink, [[replies]] (including [[RSVP]]s) out from tantek.com to Twitter, and then uses the Twitter/FB integration functionality to cascade (except for plain replies) that POSSEing from Twitter to Facebook. Reasons:
** insufficient marginal utility in writing a custom POSSE syndicator to FB.
** FB just gets abbreviated summaries (thus placing more value on tantek.com original posts).
** Exception: In 2014 Tantek started occasionally manually using [[Bridgy]] Publish to POSSE a few longer and more significant posts (notes and articles) directly from tantek.com to Facebook. 
*** Working on adding to Falcon: [[Falcon#auto_Bridgy_POSSE_to_FB|Automatic Bridgy POSSE to FB]]
* [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] does likewise, because he's lazy.

==== IFTTT ====
* [[User:Adactio.com|Adactio]] POSSEs [[notes]], [[photos]], [[articles]] out from adactio.com to Facebook using If This Then That (IFTTT).

==== Bridgy ====
[[Bridgy]] ''used to'' support POSSEing posts, event RSVPs, comments and likes, [https://brid.gy/about#rip-facebook but Facebook eventually disabled that in their API.]

* [[User:Snarfed.org]]: [https://snarfed.org/responses#replies comments], [https://snarfed.org/responses#likes likes], [https://snarfed.org/responses#rsvps RSVPs]

==== Facebook API ====
{{main|POSSE to Facebook}}
Posting to one's wall used to be supported with the Facebook 'Graph API' - see [[POSSE to Facebook]] for details and examples - [https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/ but they'll disable that in August 2018.]

For broader overview of the Facebook API, see the Social Web WG analysis:
* https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/Facebook_API

=== How to PESOS from ===
You can use the Facebook API to <span id="PESOS_from">PESOS your posts</span>, but as of the 2.x API, [https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourresponses#facebook not your comments or likes.]

=== How to backfeed from ===
There used to be a few programmatic ways to [[backfeed]] from Facebook post copies to your original posts, but [https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/05/01/facebook-login-updates-further-protect-privacy/ Facebook pretty much shut them all down in May 2018].

====  Graph API ====
The [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api Graph API] is the official way of communicating with Facebook.

To get comments for a post, ''only from users who have logged into your Facebook app and granted its permissions'', use [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/object/comments /object/comments]:

  https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/POSTID/comments?limit=LIMIT&access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN

POSTID is the id of a post; no need for any user id, just the regular, post id
LIMIT how many comments should be shown in one request
ACCESS_TOKEN is the Oauth2 access token to the service

Similarly, to get likes for a post, ''only from users who have logged into your Facebook app and granted its permissions'', , use [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/object/comments /object/likes]:

  https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/POSTID/likes?limit=LIMIT&access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN

Note recent limitations / challenges:
* 2018-04-04 Facebook Developer Blog: [https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/04/facebook-api-platform-product-changes/ API and Other Platform Product Changes] <br>For [[event]] post backfeed in particular: <blockquote>Events API<br/>Deprecated:<br/>Endpoints that return data including /feed, /posts, /comments, and the RSVP list.</blockquote> Related Bridgy issue: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/814

==== FQL ====
* before Graph API 2.2, there was FQL that could be used as:
* [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/ FQL] makes this surprisingly easy. For example, here's a query to get all comments on the posts from a given user with links in them:
  SELECT post_fbid, time, fromid, username, object_id, text FROM comment
    WHERE object_id IN (SELECT link_id FROM link WHERE owner = USER_ID)
    ORDER BY time DESC
* And here's the follow-up query to get the URLs of those links (where <tt>LINK_IDS</tt> is a comma-separated list of the <tt>object_id</tt>s from the above query):
  SELECT link_id, url FROM link WHERE link_id IN (LINK_IDS)
* See [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/blob/5e1f01016dc910369951cc0560e332025a6921bb/facebook.py#L167 example code here]. There's also [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/blob/5e1f01016dc910369951cc0560e332025a6921bb/facebook.py#L185 this example code] that fetches and processes comments from the posts found by those queries.
* API is sometimes slow. Most backfeed solutions will/should poll in offline processes though, so they won't usually block end user requests.
* Returns extremely unclear failed results for API calls to posts by under-18s
** This is bloody annoying for us minors. It's more "bothersome" than "protecting" -- [[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|barnabywalters]]

* How best to represent external users?
** Facebook URI (not preferable)
** Can we grab their personal URI from their profile?
** Detect comments from originating user?

==== Bridgy backfeed ====
[[Bridgy]] used to backfeed Facebook comments, likes, reactions, and RSVPs, [https://brid.gy/about#rip-facebook but stopped in May 2018 due to Facebook's restrictions.]

=== How to delete your account ===
Deletion of an account is made deliberately awkward and uncomfortable by Facebook. Note that there are two separate types of account deletion, viz. Deactivation and Deletion.

==== Deactivation of an Account ====
'''Deactivation''' of an Account can be achieved using the normal Facebook menus.

The system in January 2018 was as follows:

*Click the account menu at the top right of any Facebook page
*Select Settings
*Choose Manage your account and then scroll down to click '''Deactivate your account'''.
*You are asked to choose the reason for deactivation, such as 'It's not fun' or 'I don't feel safe' - Facebook will provide 'solutions' to the issue you choose such as 'make more friends'
*You are also presented with a selection of your friends with prompts that 'xxxx will miss you' in an attempt to emotionally manipulate you into staying.

Surprisingly, deactivation is not hidden away under layers of menus; it is in plain sight being in the description of the Manage your account section of settings.

Note that Deactivating your account just means that your profile becomes 'hidden' to other Facebook users. Your posts, photos, tags, comments are all still present on Facebook, as is all data Facebook hold about you, whether that was provided by you in profile settings or otherwise. Messages you have sent to other users will still be visible to them. If you change your mind, simply logging back into Facebook restores all data to a user-accessible state.

==== Deletion of an Account ====
'''Deletion''' of an Account '''cannot''' be accomplished using the Facebook menus.
* Go to the page [https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account] which is linked from various help articles
* Complete your password
* You are then informed that:

''Your account has been deactivated from the site and will be permanently deleted within 14 days. If you log into your account within the next 14 days, you will have the option to cancel your request.''

Deleting your account removes all photos, tags, comments and all user-provided data from Facebook. It does '''not''' delete non-user-provided data, such as your identity in 'tags' from other users photographs, your telephone number and email address if provided by another user (e.g. by accessing Contacts on a smartphone)

Facebook has a number of interesting [[post]] types, each with different appearances and interfaces. Some better than others.

User features Facebook handles on other sites:
* embeddable [[like]], [[repost|share]] etc. buttons ([[webaction]])
* [[Facebook Comments Plugin]]

=== Status Update ===
Status updates are [[notes]] similar to [[Twitter]] tweets, that, including status updates with links (see below) are perhaps the most common type of top-level post on FB.

2011 limitation and Note distinction:
* 419 character limit as of 2011-02-16. When you try to post 420 or more characters, you get an alert:
http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5450622726_a12b9d13f4_o.png
<blockquote>Status updates must be less than 420 characters. You have entered 1,035 <br/>characters here. Notes can be much longer. Would you like to edit and post <br/>your update as a Note instead?</blockquote> via http://tantek.com/2011/047/b1/facebook-installed-application-activities-not-deletes

=== Link ===
Links posts are essentially status updates, but they have a different presentation due to the [[link-preview]] that is shown for the first link mentioned in the update.
=== Photo ===
[[Photo]] posts are perhaps the second most popular type of top-level post on FB.
=== Event ===
{{main|event#Facebook}}
Facebook's [[event]] posts were quite clean and nicely designed, until they started rolling out a new design on 2014-02-27. Here is the design just before that point:

[[File:20140227-facebook-event-example.png]]

Sometime in 2015(?specific date), Facebook launched a new event UI which includes:
* a [[related events]] box in the right column, just underneath the "Invite Friends" box below the attendees box showing interested, going, invited numbers, as well as a few friends who have RSVPd at least interested/maybe or yes.

=== Comment ===
[[Comments]] are perhaps the overall most popular type of post, as people comment A LOT on other top-level posts, and Facebook has a two level notion of comment threading. That is, you can both comment on top-level posts, and comment on comments on top-level posts. The above event post screenshot demonstrates this two level [[commenting interface]].

=== Aggregator ===
Facebook performs the function of a feed aggregator of all your friends' activities.

Some examples screenshots can be found here:
* https://www.facebook.com/about/newsfeed

Analysis of some of the algorithms Facebook uses to choose what to display to users:
* http://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/uncovering-algorithms-looking-inside-the-facebook-news-feed

=== Comments Embed ===
Facebook has a feature called '''[http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/ Comments Box]''' which "is a social plugin that enables user commenting on your site." Indieweb sites can use it to embed a [[comments]] box on blog [[posts]].

Though this does encourage your readers to sharecrop (on Facebook) their comments on your posts, it also provides them a single place to view their comments they've made across any/all sites that use Facebook for comments.

No indieweb community members are currently using this on their own sites.

IndieWeb community members that have tried this and their experience:
* Aaron Parecki:
** "Facebook tends to get more comments [than Disqus] for me probably because everyone has an account and is always logged in"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819651]
** "eventually I decided the quality of comments I was getting wasn't high enough and I didn't actually care about peoples' random crap they were leaving on my site"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819689]

=== Groups ===
Facebook groups have a variety of privacy settings. 

Removing someone from a group prompts to delete their posts or comments from the last 7 days.

[[File:facebook-remove-from-group-prompt.png]]

If you are the last member of the group and you leave the group, a confirmation is displayed saying that the group will be deleted.

[[File:facebook-leave-group-delete.png]]

=== Anti-patterns ===
Some things that Facebook implements are actually [[anti-patterns]] and to be avoided:
* [[nagging]] (example inside)

== Activities Examples ==
* Alice shared Bob's status update.
* Alice shared Bob's photo.
* Alice likes Some Page.
* Alice likes a photo.
* Alice and 8 other friends wrote on Bob's timeline for his birthday.
* Alice added 3 new photos to the album Some Album.
* Alice updated her cover photo.
* Alice changed her profile picture.
* Alice commented on a link.
* Alice shared a link.
* Alice was tagged in Bob's photo.
* Alice played 10 sounds on SoundCloud.
* Alice added a job at Some Company to her timeline.
* Alice likes a photo on Instagram.
* Alice shared a story via Some Page.
* Alice made your photo her profile picture [[File:fb-made-your-photo-their-profile-pic.png]]
* Alice just posted for the first time in a while. [[File:just-posted-for-the-first-time-in-a-while.png]]

== rel-me ==
Facebook does not currently support [[rel-me]] on their user profiles.

However, they do have a "website" field in the UI which you can set.

And then applications that wish to use that field for a one-off rel-me equivalence test can access that through their API:

* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/

Careful parsing it, people often put multiple whitespace- or newline-separated urls.

== Additional Resources ==
=== Profile Image URLs ===
Perhaps unofficially, you can get your Facebook profile image as a resized JPEG using a graph.facebook.com URL, your Facebook user ID, and dimensions, which will redirect to an actual URL. e.g.:
* {{t}}'s: https://graph.facebook.com/214611/picture?width=280&height=280

=== Collects App Data Usage from Android Apps even when Not Installed ===
<blockquote>Here’s the bad news: seven apps, including Yelp, the language-learning app Duolingo and the job search app Indeed, as well as the King James Bible app and two Muslim prayer apps, Qibla Connect and Muslim Pro, still send your personal data to Facebook before you can decide whether you want to consent or not. Keep in mind: these are apps with millions of installs.<a href="https://privacyinternational.org/blog/2758/guess-what-facebook-still-tracks-you-android-apps-even-if-you-dont-have-facebook-account"><cite>Privacy International</cite></a> </blockquote>

=== Does Little to Limit Attacks on Female Politicians ===
In the 2018 Congressional and state elections in the United States female candidates faced increased online threats on Facebook that ranged from sexist attacks to death threats [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/politics/women-harassment-elections.html]
<blockquote>Under the current policy, there is no recourse for harassment via an anonymous Facebook page until a threat is made. Waiting for harassment to escalate isn’t a tool designed to protect women. It’s endorsing a culture in which violence against women is the norm.<cite><a href="https://ctmirror.org/category/ct-viewpoints/leading-while-female-beyond-metoo-and-neveragain/">State Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, Connecticut, USA</a></cite></blockquote>
=== Paying Teenagers for Root Access to Cell Phones ===
Facebook, after having their apps banned by Apple Store decided to pay teenagers $20 a month for root access to their cell phones in order to spy on competitors
<blockquote>Facebook has been secretly paying people to install a “Facebook Research” VPN that lets the company suck in all of a user’s phone and web activity, similar to Facebook’s Onavo Protect app that Apple banned in June and that was removed in August. Facebook sidesteps the App Store and rewards teenagers and adults to download the Research app and give it root access to network traffic in what may be a violation of Apple policy so the social network can decrypt and analyze their phone activity.<cite><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook pays Teens to Install VPN that Spies On Them</a></cite></blockquote>
It was later revelead that 18% of participants in the program were teens and not the 5% that facebook originally claimed.
<blockquote>At the time we ended the Facebook Research App on Apple’s iOS platform, less than 5 percent of the people sharing data with us through this program were teens. Analysis shows that number is about 18 percent when you look at the complete lifetime of the program, and also add people who had become inactive and uninstalled the app.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/facebook-research-teens/"><cite>Facebook admits 18% of Research spyware users were teens, not <5%</cite></a></blockquote>

=== Preying on Children ===
Even after complaints from employees that the in app purchases may confuse children facebook refused to provide refunds to parents resulting in lawsuits. Internal documents reveal that facebook referred to children who accidently charged parent credit cards heavily as "whales," a term used by casinos and con artists to note easy lucrative and naive targets.
<blockquote>In one of the unsealed documents, two Facebook employees deny a refund request from a child whom they refer to as a “whale” – a term coined by the casino industry to describe profligate spenders. The child had entered a credit card number to play a game, and in about two weeks racked up thousands of dollars in charges, according to an excerpt of messages between two employees at the social media giant.<cite><a href="https://www.revealnews.org/blog/a-judge-unsealed-a-trove-of-internal-facebook-documents-following-our-legal-action/">Center for Investigative Reporting</a></cite></blockquote>

=== Algorithmic Filtering ===
Facebook uses a proprietary algorithm to show you a fraction (what they think you want to see) of the posts from your friends, and people & pages you follow. Up to 85% less than "all".[http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/12/facebook-all-feed-link/]

While Schrage took blame for hiring "Definers" shortly afterwards dpa (german press agency) tickered that several agencies were hired too.

These PR agencies produced Fake News and antisemitic conspiracy theories to attack George Soros [https://www.vox.com/2018/11/14/18096008/facebook-zuckerberg-data-crisis-denial-antisemitism] because he characterized Facebook and Google as a “menace to society” at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2018.
It seems to be irrelevant for Facebook that Soros supported the company financially before, for example by paying their german factcheckers (deu) [https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/aufklaerung-ueber-fake-news-correctiv-erhaelt-geld-von-george-soros-a-1141799.html] …]

=== API Degradation ===

Version 2.0[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog#v2_0] of the Facebook API mostly makes sensible changes to help tamp down spammy or privacy-violating apps (e.g. prevents you from seeing a user's friends unless the friends have also granted privileges to the app). But this change has broken some features that IndieWeb sites and [[Bridgy]] Publish depend on. Full discussion [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-01-21#t1421881404849 on IRC]

* Apps are given app-scoped user IDs now (i.e. they are unique to the application, as opposed to the global user IDs v1.0 used)
* However, given a user's username, you can apparently no longer find their user ID.
* Which means that you cannot get the post ID for a post from its URL.
** For some posts you can look them up by /v2.2/{post-id} but most posts expect /v2.2/{user-id}_{post-id}, and there doesn't seem to be any predictable way to tell if a post wants the former id or the latter.

=== API Inconsistency ===

The ID for a number of comments has changed over time, resulting in Bridgy sending apparently duplicate mentions to the same post. The symptom is that the same comment will be received with an ID of the form USERID_POSTID, and later the same comment will have an ID with a different form, containing colons and apparently magic numbers.[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/305]

On 2015-04-07, Facebook support let us know that this "IDs like these can appear sometimes", and that it will not be fixed.

=== Hand-approval required to post via API ===
Unless the application developer is the only user, Facebook now requires applications to be hand-approved by the Facebook team if they are to post to a user's stream. This requires an application logo, complete screenshot walkthrough, and full privacy policy.

=== Big data collection allows intrusive inference ===

* A 2013 study found that accurate predictions can be made about the personality, political preferences and even sexual orientations of Facebook users based only on which Facebook pages a user "likes", even if a user hasn't explicitly revealed that information on their profile. ([http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/11/facebook-likes-personality-traits_n_2854403.html Huffington Post writeup])
* A 2009 study at MIT found that social network analysis of Facebook friend relationships could also reveal a user's sexuality. ([http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/facebook-friends-sexual-orientation/ Mashable])
* The inference is often so accurate that many people are convinced that Facebook is listening to their phone's microphone. Reply-All's podcast episode 109, published 2-11-2017, [https://gimletmedia.com/episode/109-facebook-spying/ Is Facebook Spying on You?], demonstrates the futility of trying to persuade people that it is not spying, just data-gathering and manipulation that makes Facebook so creepy. Also supports the old journalistic epigram about the correct response to a headline that is a question. Of course, Facebook could also be spying.

=== Real Name demands ===
While not as bad as [[Google+]], Facebook have been attempting to enforce the "real name" policy. In 2014-09, it was revealed Facebook had disabled the accounts of a number of [[wikipedia:Drag queen|drag queens]] requiring them to use their legal names. [http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/facebook-demands-drag-queens-change-names/]

2014-09-17: Accounts which don't seem like they have "normal" names have also been challenged by Facebook's policy. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/facebook-chase-nahooikaikakeolamauloaokalani-silva-_n_5833248.html]

2015-06-26: Facebook disabled a user's account because of their name, the same name they used to work for and get paid by Facebook as an employee:
* <cite>[https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03 My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not to use on the site]</cite>

=== Image used in link preview ===
On 2014-09-29, when I pasted a link to a blog post in a Facebook status, the link preview used one of the comment's avatars instead of the <code>og:image</code> meta element I have had in my HTML for years. I had to manually click through the images until the correct logo appeared. I am not sure if this is a glitch or if Facebook has changed their algorithm. 

After using Facebook's [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/ Open Graph Object Debugger], I found it reported:

<blockquote>og:image was not defined, could not be downloaded or was not big enough. Please define a chosen image using the og:image metatag, and use an image that's at least 200x200px and is accessible from Facebook.</blockquote>

The image I'm using currently is only ~120px square. I guess that explains it, but it seems silly for Facebook to ignore the explicit <code>og:image</code> element I have set up. — {{gRegor}}

=== Duplicate Events Created without Confirmation ===
On 2014-10-20 I ({{kylewm}}) tried to create a new HWC event using the "Copy Event" UI. I filled in the appropriate fields and clicked "Create". The button greyed out momentarily, and then re-enabled without any confirmation that the event had been copied. I checked my activity feed to see if it was there, and it was not, so I proceeded to click Create two more times before it seemed to go through. Some time later, 3 identical FB events all appeared (maybe an eventual consistency issue?).

=== Doesn't delete deleted data ===
Facebook does not really delete data when a user clicks on 'delete', but it flags the post as 'deleted', keeping all the data in it's database.

* http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/Complaint_05_Deleted_Posts.pdf

=== Encourages Bad Online Publishing Behaviors ===
[http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2906 http://www.qwantz.com/comics/comic2-2912.png]
Perhaps cliché and thus source for humor but with elements of truth. Unclear if these bad behaviors are due to Facebook's UI/UX (especially Newsfeed / like / share feedback loop), or just that Facebook is surfacing existing behaviors across a very broad spectrum of people. The humor in the cartoon works because these behaviors are fairly known / expected by users of Facebook. Still, specific citations would help with further analysis to see if the indieweb can do better (or is vulnerable to doing worse).
* Posting about minor annoyances [citation needed]
* Sponsored posts [citation needed]
* Sharing of "clickbait" headlines [citation needed]
* "Here's a friend crossposting from [[Twitter]], so all these @ tags don't work." - perhaps a good reason to NOT secondhand [[POSSE]] from Twitter to FB. [citation needed]
* Posting racist screeds that rely upon made-up quotes and statistics [citation needed]

=== Social experiment performed on users ===
* A study published June 2, 2014 revealed that one week in 2012, Facebook tweaked the feeds of about 700,000 users to see if it could manipulate their mood and posting behavior [http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/]

=== Live user frustration test ===
Facebook deliberately artificially crashed their Android app as a live (unbeknownst to the users) user-test to test frustration / abandonment! https://twitter.com/internetofshit/status/684124629963685888 and https://twitter.com/internetofshit/status/684125090527752194: <br/>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CX5_uaQUsAEGKht.png

=== Facebook use causes decline in satisfaction ===
2013-04-17 The Economist: <cite>[http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21583593-using-social-network-seems-make-people-more-miserable-get-life Facebook is bad for you: Get a life! Using the social network seems to make people more miserable]</cite>

<blockquote><p>… the more someone uses Facebook, the less satisfied he is with life.</p><p>[…]</p><p>the more a volunteer used Facebook in the period between two questionnaires, the worse he reported feeling the next time he filled in a questionnaire. Volunteers were also asked to rate their satisfaction with life at the start and the end of the study. Those who used Facebook a lot were more likely to report a decline in satisfaction than those who visited the site infrequently.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>But an earlier investigation, conducted by social scientists at Humboldt University and Darmstadt’s Technical University, both in Germany, may have found the root cause. These researchers, who presented their findings at a conference in Leipzig in February, surveyed 584 users of Facebook aged mostly in their 20s. '''They found that the most common emotion aroused by using Facebook is envy.''' Endlessly comparing themselves with peers who have doctored their photographs, amplified their achievements and plagiarised their bons mots can leave Facebook’s users more than a little green-eyed. '''Real-life encounters, by contrast, are more WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get).'''</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.

=== Builds demographic profiles including "ethnic affinity" ===
Facebook does not ask you about your ethnicity, but builds demographic profiles based on what you do on the site, including an "ethnic affinity". ProPublica demonstrated and reported that ads for housing could exclude people based on this "ethnic affinity". Facebook has since announced they will disable "ethnic affinity" targeting for housing, employment, and credit-related ads.

=== Let advertisers target users interested in Nazis ===
<blockquote>Despite promises of greater oversight following past advertising scandals, a Times review shows that Facebook has continued to allow advertisers to target hundreds of thousands of users the social media firm believes are curious about topics such as “Joseph Goebbels,” “Josef Mengele,” “Heinrich Himmler,” the neo-nazi punk band Skrewdriver and Benito Mussolini’s long-defunct National Fascist Party.</blockquote>

=== Downtime ===
Though typically rare and brief, Facebook does go down / offline from time to time, most recently:

==== 2017-10-11 Outage ====

==== 2017-08-26 Outage ====

==== 2016-08-26 Partial Outage ====
* 2016-08-26 ~16:00-16:10 (at least) flakey / apparent unavailability of page events pages:
[[File:2016-239-FB-sorry-something-wrong.png]]
<blockquote>Sorry, something went wrong.</blockquote>

==== 2014-08-01 Outage ====
2014-08-01 CNBC: [http://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/01/facebook-currently-down-for-some-users.html Facebook goes down for many users]

* 2014-08-01 ~9:00-9:40 flakey / intermittent availability with lots of "Something went wrong" messages, e.g. on a permalink page when logged in:
[[File:FB something wrong 2014-08-01.png]]
* on a group page when logged in:
[[File:FB group down 2014-08-01.png]]
* and on the home page:
[[File:facebook is down 20140801.png]]
* on a previously loaded FB page, the "Notifications" globe drop-down just rotated a progress image for minutes and never loads:
[[File:FB notifications dropdown not loading 2014-08-01.png]]

=== Prefers Pageviews Over Efficient UX ===
Per the documentation in [[reader#Integrated_Activity_Reading]], one of Facebook's UI experiments involved an integrated reading experience that showed by posts and other "activities" in a single reading stream:

https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/gpnggaky8d1gog_small.jpg

What they found was that it was ''too'' efficient - users were reading things and not clicking to see additional pages.

Thus they abandoned the experiment, instead preferring a UI that generates more pageviews over a UI that is more efficient for users.

This may present an opportunity for IndieWeb [[UX]] to exceed [[silo]] UX.

=== Link Wrapper Problems ===
==== Link Wrapper Unreliability ====
Facebook's link wrapper lm.facebook.com sometimes has outages, thus breaking all links in content in Facebook.

E.g. 2014-08-10 ~21:25-21:32 (at least)

[[File:2014-222-lm-facebook-504-error.jpg]]

==== Hyperlink Fear Interstitial ====

<blockquote>1. Filtered feed. Truth is this is a mixed bag. For me it's a HUGE deal because I have put thousands of hours into tuning my feed and I have many of the world's top technologists on Facebook.</blockquote>

Someday Facebook will change ''something'' (or just [[site-deaths|disappear]]), and all these hours will be wasted. Imagine if he'd spent just 1/10th of that time working on his own site. — {{gRegor}}

In the case of Facebook, this includes posts, friends, and events—in short, the entire social graph. Users created this data, so they should have the right to export it to other social networks.''' Given inertia and the convenience of Facebook, I wouldn’t expect this reform to trigger a mass flight of users. Instead, the likely outcome would be an explosion of innovation and entrepreneurship. Facebook is so powerful that most new entrants would avoid head-on competition in favor of creating sustainable differentiation.</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.
