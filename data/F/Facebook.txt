=== How to POSSE to ===
{{main|POSSE to Facebook}}

There are <span id="POSSE_out_to">multiple ways to [[POSSE]]</span> out ''some'' things from your indieweb site to your Facebook profile. Specifically, you can POSSE posts and event RSVPs, but [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/350 as of the 2.x Facebook API, ''not'' comments or likes.] Comments and likes [https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourresponses#facebook can't be PESOSed either.]

Existing techniques:

==== from Twitter ====
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] POSSEs [[notes]], [[articles]] by name + permalink, [[replies]] (including [[RSVP]]s) out from tantek.com to Twitter, and then uses the Twitter/FB integration functionality to cascade (except for plain replies) that POSSEing from Twitter to Facebook. Reasons:
** insufficient marginal utility in writing a custom POSSE syndicator to FB.
** FB just gets abbreviated summaries (thus placing more value on tantek.com original posts).
** Exception: In 2014 Tantek started occasionally manually using [[Bridgy]] Publish to POSSE a few longer and more significant posts (notes and articles) directly from tantek.com to Facebook. 
*** Working on adding to Falcon: [[Falcon#auto_Bridgy_POSSE_to_FB|Automatic Bridgy POSSE to FB]]
* [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] does likewise, because he's lazy.

==== IFTTT ====
* [[User:Adactio.com|Adactio]] POSSEs [[notes]], [[photos]], [[articles]] out from adactio.com to Facebook using If This Then That (IFTTT).

==== Bridgy ====
You can use [[Bridgy]] to POSSE Facebook posts and event RSVPs. [https://www.brid.gy/about#publish Details here.]

Bridgy ''used to'' support POSSEing comments and likes, [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/350 but Facebook's 2.x API disabled that.]

* [[User:Snarfed.org]]: [https://snarfed.org/responses#replies comments], [https://snarfed.org/responses#likes likes], [https://snarfed.org/responses#rsvps RSVPs]

==== Facebook API ====
{{main|POSSE to Facebook}}
Posting to one's wall is supported with the Facebook 'Graph API'. See [[POSSE to Facebook]] for details and examples.

For broader overview of the Facebook API, see the Social Web WG analysis:
* https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/Facebook_API

=== How to PESOS from ===
You can use the Facebook API to <span id="PESOS_from">PESOS your posts</span>, but as of the 2.x API, [https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourresponses#facebook not your comments or likes.]

=== How to wean yourself from ===
If you’re looking to reduce your usage of Facebook, you may find that incrementally doing so (as opposed to doing a cold-turkey [[silo-quit]]) may be easier.

Here are some steps to take.

# Use facebook.com/events instead of facebook.com'''
#* Goal: stop checking Facebook's News Feed (for all the reasons given in [[#Criticism]]).
#** IndieWeb folks doing this: {{t}}
#* Still allows:
#** going to events organized on FB (seeing invitations, responding etc.)
#** seeing current birthdays (today, yesterday, tomorrow)
#** checking Notifications (toolbar globe icon)
#** checking Message activity (toolbar talk bubble icon)
#** checking Friending activity (toolbar person outline icon)
# Take a week+ "off the grid" vacation during which you're unable to check Facebook notifications
#* Goal: stop checking Facebook notifications
#* IndieWeb folks who have done this: {{t}} (2016-08-07 for ~1 week, 2017-08-01 for ~1.5 weeks, by being off Facebook the website completely, still using FB Messenger app for comms)

==== Weaning Brainstorming ====
More thoughts on how one could reduce one's Facebook usage

* document all your Facebook use-cases as itches to implement on your own site
* pick the easiest use-case to implement yourself, build it, and try stopping using Facebook for that
* ...

=== How to delete your account ===
TBD.

Has anyone deleted their Facebook account? What's the process? How long do they hold your data anyway? Etc.

Facebook has a number of interesting [[post]] types, each with different appearances and interfaces. Some better than others.

User features Facebook handles on other sites:
* embeddable [[like]], [[repost|share]] etc. buttons ([[webaction]])
* [[Facebook Comments Plugin]]

=== Status Update ===
Status updates are [[notes]] similar to [[Twitter]] tweets, that, including status updates with links (see below) are perhaps the most common type of top-level post on FB.

2011 limitation and Note distinction:
* 419 character limit as of 2011-02-16. When you try to post 420 or more characters, you get an alert:
http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5450622726_a12b9d13f4_o.png
<blockquote>Status updates must be less than 420 characters. You have entered 1,035 <br/>characters here. Notes can be much longer. Would you like to edit and post <br/>your update as a Note instead?</blockquote> via http://tantek.com/2011/047/b1/facebook-installed-application-activities-not-deletes

=== Link ===
Links posts are essentially status updates, but they have a different presentation due to the [[link-preview]] that is shown for the first link mentioned in the update.
=== Photo ===
[[Photo]] posts are perhaps the second most popular type of top-level post on FB.
=== Event ===
{{main|event#Facebook}}
Facebook's [[event]] posts were quite clean and nicely designed, until they started rolling out a new design on 2014-02-27. Here is the design just before that point:

[[File:20140227-facebook-event-example.png]]

Sometime in 2015(?specific date), Facebook launched a new event UI which includes:
* a [[related events]] box in the right column, just underneath the "Invite Friends" box below the attendees box showing interested, going, invited numbers, as well as a few friends who have RSVPd at least interested/maybe or yes.

=== Comment ===
[[Comments]] are perhaps the overall most popular type of post, as people comment A LOT on other top-level posts, and Facebook has a two level notion of comment threading. That is, you can both comment on top-level posts, and comment on comments on top-level posts. The above event post screenshot demonstrates this two level [[commenting interface]].

=== Aggregator ===
Facebook performs the function of a feed aggregator of all your friends' activities.

Some examples screenshots can be found here:
* https://www.facebook.com/about/newsfeed

Analysis of some of the algorithms Facebook uses to choose what to display to users:
* http://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/uncovering-algorithms-looking-inside-the-facebook-news-feed

=== Comments Embed ===
Facebook has a feature called '''[http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/ Comments Box]''' which "is a social plugin that enables user commenting on your site." Indieweb sites can use it to embed a [[comments]] box on blog [[posts]].

Though this does encourage your readers to sharecrop (on Facebook) their comments on your posts, it also provides them a single place to view their comments they've made across any/all sites that use Facebook for comments.

No indieweb community members are currently using this on their own sites.

IndieWeb community members that have tried this and their experience:
* Aaron Parecki:
** "Facebook tends to get more comments [than Disqus] for me probably because everyone has an account and is always logged in"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819651]
** "eventually I decided the quality of comments I was getting wasn't high enough and I didn't actually care about peoples' random crap they were leaving on my site"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819689]

=== Groups ===
Facebook groups have a variety of privacy settings. 

Removing someone from a group prompts to delete their posts or comments from the last 7 days.

[[File:facebook-remove-from-group-prompt.png]]

If you are the last member of the group and you leave the group, a confirmation is displayed saying that the group will be deleted.

[[File:facebook-leave-group-delete.png]]

=== Anti-patterns ===
Some things that Facebook implements are actually [[anti-patterns]] and to be avoided:
* [[nagging]] (example inside)

== Activities Examples ==
* Alice shared Bob's status update.
* Alice shared Bob's photo.
* Alice likes Some Page.
* Alice likes a photo.
* Alice and 8 other friends wrote on Bob's timeline for his birthday.
* Alice added 3 new photos to the album Some Album.
* Alice updated her cover photo.
* Alice changed her profile picture.
* Alice commented on a link.
* Alice shared a link.
* Alice was tagged in Bob's photo.
* Alice played 10 sounds on SoundCloud.
* Alice added a job at Some Company to her timeline.
* Alice likes a photo on Instagram.
* Alice shared a story via Some Page.
* Alice made your photo her profile picture [[File:fb-made-your-photo-their-profile-pic.png]]
* Alice just posted for the first time in a while. [[File:just-posted-for-the-first-time-in-a-while.png]]

== rel-me ==
Facebook does not currently support [[rel-me]] on their user profiles.

However, they do have a "website" field in the UI which you can set.

And then applications that wish to use that field for a one-off rel-me equivalence test can access that through their API:

* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/

Careful parsing it, people often put multiple whitespace- or newline-separated urls.

=== Algorithmic Filtering ===
Facebook uses a proprietary algorithm to show you a fraction (what they think you want to see) of the posts from your friends, and people & pages you follow. Up to 85% less than "all".[http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/12/facebook-all-feed-link/]

This has been criticized many times.

=== API Degradation ===

Version 2.0[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog#v2_0] of the Facebook API mostly makes sensible changes to help tamp down spammy or privacy-violating apps (e.g. prevents you from seeing a user's friends unless the friends have also granted privileges to the app). But this change has broken some features that IndieWeb sites and [[Bridgy]] Publish depend on. Full discussion [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-01-21#t1421881404849 on IRC]

* Apps are given app-scoped user IDs now (i.e. they are unique to the application, as opposed to the global user IDs v1.0 used)
* However, given a user's username, you can apparently no longer find their user ID.
* Which means that you cannot get the post ID for a post from its URL.
** For some posts you can look them up by /v2.2/{post-id} but most posts expect /v2.2/{user-id}_{post-id}, and there doesn't seem to be any predictable way to tell if a post wants the former id or the latter.

=== API Inconsistency ===

The ID for a number of comments has changed over time, resulting in Bridgy sending apparently duplicate mentions to the same post. The symptom is that the same comment will be received with an ID of the form USERID_POSTID, and later the same comment will have an ID with a different form, containing colons and apparently magic numbers.[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/305]

On 2015-04-07, Facebook support let us know that this "IDs like these can appear sometimes", and that it will not be fixed.

=== Hand-approval required to post via API ===
Unless the application developer is the only user, Facebook now requires applications to be hand-approved by the Facebook team if they are to post to a user's stream. This requires an application logo, complete screenshot walkthrough, and full privacy policy.

=== Big data collection allows intrusive inference ===
<span id="Facebook.27s_big_data_collection_allows_intrusive_inference_about_you">Facebook's big data collection allows intrusive inference about you</span>

* 2016-01-28 Gerd Leonhard: [http://www.futuristgerd.com/2016/01/28/the-evilfication-of-facebook-boiling-frogs-and-10-arguments-why-i-may-quit-facebook-take-the-poll/ The evilfication of Facebook: boiling frogs, faustian bargains, and the pleasure trap: 10 arguments for quitting Facebook]
* A 2013 study found that accurate predictions can be made about the personality, political preferences and even sexual orientations of Facebook users based only on which Facebook pages a user "likes", even if a user hasn't explicitly revealed that information on their profile. ([http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/11/facebook-likes-personality-traits_n_2854403.html Huffington Post writeup])
* A 2009 study at MIT found that social network analysis of Facebook friend relationships could also reveal a user's sexuality. ([http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/facebook-friends-sexual-orientation/ Mashable])
* The inference is often so accurate that many people are convinced that Facebook is listening to their phone's microphone. Reply-All's podcast episode 109, published 2-11-2017, [https://gimletmedia.com/episode/109-facebook-spying/ Is Facebook Spying on You?], demonstrates the futility of trying to persuade people that it is not spying, just data-gathering and manipulation that makes Facebook so creepy. Also supports the old journalistic epigram about the correct response to a headline that is a question. Of course, Facebook could also be spying.

=== Real Name demands ===
While not as bad as [[Google+]], Facebook have been attempting to enforce the "real name" policy. In 2014-09, it was revealed Facebook had disabled the accounts of a number of [[wikipedia:Drag queen|drag queens]] requiring them to use their legal names. [http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/facebook-demands-drag-queens-change-names/]

2014-09-17: Accounts which don't seem like they have "normal" names have also been challenged by Facebook's policy. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/facebook-chase-nahooikaikakeolamauloaokalani-silva-_n_5833248.html]

2015-06-26: Facebook disabled a user's account because of their name, the same name they used to work for and get paid by Facebook as an employee:
* <cite>[https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03 My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not to use on the site]</cite>

=== Image used in link preview ===
On 2014-09-29, when I pasted a link to a blog post in a Facebook status, the link preview used one of the comment's avatars instead of the <code>og:image</code> meta element I have had in my HTML for years. I had to manually click through the images until the correct logo appeared. I am not sure if this is a glitch or if Facebook has changed their algorithm. 

After using Facebook's [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/ Open Graph Object Debugger], I found it reported:

<blockquote>og:image was not defined, could not be downloaded or was not big enough. Please define a chosen image using the og:image metatag, and use an image that's at least 200x200px and is accessible from Facebook.</blockquote>

The image I'm using currently is only ~120px square. I guess that explains it, but it seems silly for Facebook to ignore the explicit <code>og:image</code> element I have set up. — {{gRegor}}

=== Duplicate Events Created without Confirmation ===
On 2014-10-20 I ({{kylewm}}) tried to create a new HWC event using the "Copy Event" UI. I filled in the appropriate fields and clicked "Create". The button greyed out momentarily, and then re-enabled without any confirmation that the event had been copied. I checked my activity feed to see if it was there, and it was not, so I proceeded to click Create two more times before it seemed to go through. Some time later, 3 identical FB events all appeared (maybe an eventual consistency issue?).

=== Doesn't delete deleted data ===
Facebook does not really delete data when a user clicks on 'delete', but it flags the post as 'deleted', keeping all the data in it's database.

* http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/Complaint_05_Deleted_Posts.pdf

=== Encourages Bad Online Publishing Behaviors ===
[http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2906 http://www.qwantz.com/comics/comic2-2912.png]
Perhaps cliché and thus source for humor but with elements of truth. Unclear if these bad behaviors are due to Facebook's UI/UX (especially Newsfeed / like / share feedback loop), or just that Facebook is surfacing existing behaviors across a very broad spectrum of people. The humor in the cartoon works because these behaviors are fairly known / expected by users of Facebook. Still, specific citations would help with further analysis to see if the indieweb can do better (or is vulnerable to doing worse).
* Posting about minor annoyances [citation needed]
* Sponsored posts [citation needed]
* Sharing of "clickbait" headlines [citation needed]
* "Here's a friend crossposting from [[Twitter]], so all these @ tags don't work." - perhaps a good reason to NOT secondhand [[POSSE]] from Twitter to FB. [citation needed]
* Posting racist screeds that rely upon made-up quotes and statistics [citation needed]

=== Social experiment performed on users ===
* A study published June 2, 2014 revealed that one week in 2012, Facebook tweaked the feeds of about 700,000 users to see if it could manipulate their mood and posting behavior [http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/]

=== Live user frustration test ===
Facebook deliberately artificially crashed their Android app as a live (unbeknownst to the users) user-test to test frustration / abandonment! https://twitter.com/internetofshit/status/684124629963685888 and https://twitter.com/internetofshit/status/684125090527752194: <br/>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CX5_uaQUsAEGKht.png

=== Harmful to Body Image ===
* 2014-04-10 LiveScience / Agata Blaszczak-Boxe: <cite>[http://www.livescience.com/44723-facebook-women-body-image.html Dislike: Facebook May Hurt Women's Body Image]</cite>

=== Facebook use causes decline in satisfaction ===
2013-04-17 The Economist: <cite>[http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21583593-using-social-network-seems-make-people-more-miserable-get-life Facebook is bad for you: Get a life! Using the social network seems to make people more miserable]</cite>

<blockquote><p>… the more someone uses Facebook, the less satisfied he is with life.</p><p>[…]</p><p>the more a volunteer used Facebook in the period between two questionnaires, the worse he reported feeling the next time he filled in a questionnaire. Volunteers were also asked to rate their satisfaction with life at the start and the end of the study. Those who used Facebook a lot were more likely to report a decline in satisfaction than those who visited the site infrequently.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>But an earlier investigation, conducted by social scientists at Humboldt University and Darmstadt’s Technical University, both in Germany, may have found the root cause. These researchers, who presented their findings at a conference in Leipzig in February, surveyed 584 users of Facebook aged mostly in their 20s. '''They found that the most common emotion aroused by using Facebook is envy.''' Endlessly comparing themselves with peers who have doctored their photographs, amplified their achievements and plagiarised their bons mots can leave Facebook’s users more than a little green-eyed. '''Real-life encounters, by contrast, are more WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get).'''</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.

=== Builds demographic profiles including "ethnic affinity" ===
Facebook does not ask you about your ethnicity, but builds demographic profiles based on what you do on the site, including an "ethnic affinity". ProPublica demonstrated and reported that ads for housing could exclude people based on this "ethnic affinity". Facebook has since announced they will disable "ethnic affinity" targeting for housing, employment, and credit-related ads.

=== Downtime ===
Though typically rare and brief, Facebook does go down / offline from time to time, most recently:

=== Prefers Pageviews Over Efficient UX ===
Per the documentation in [[reader#Integrated_Activity_Reading]], one of Facebook's UI experiments involved an integrated reading experience that showed by posts and other "activities" in a single reading stream:

https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/gpnggaky8d1gog_small.jpg

What they found was that it was ''too'' efficient - users were reading things and not clicking to see additional pages.

Thus they abandoned the experiment, instead preferring a UI that generates more pageviews over a UI that is more efficient for users.

This may present an opportunity for IndieWeb [[UX]] to exceed [[silo]] UX.

=== Link Wrapper Problems ===
==== Link Wrapper Unreliability ====
Facebook's link wrapper lm.facebook.com sometimes has outages, thus breaking all links in content in Facebook.

E.g. 2014-08-10 ~21:25-21:32 (at least)

==== Hyperlink Fear Interstitial ====

[[Facebook]] mobile app (apparently) warning the user about [[Twitter]] t.co link-wrapped links as having "a problem".

== Advocates ==
Robert Scoble defended using Facebook in a post, "[https://plus.google.com/+Scobleizer/posts/ZSJzgnvKaWy What will you miss when you quit Facebook?]"

<blockquote>1. Filtered feed. Truth is this is a mixed bag. For me it's a HUGE deal because I have put thousands of hours into tuning my feed and I have many of the world's top technologists on Facebook.</blockquote>

Someday Facebook will change ''something'' (or just [[site-deaths|disappear]]), and all these hours will be wasted. Imagine if he'd spent just 1/10th of that time working on his own site. — {{gRegor}}

== Mottos ==
Facebook has some development mottos that we can perhaps learn from.
=== Move Fast And Break Things ===
From ??? until 2014-04-30, Facebook infamously had the motto:
* Move Fast and Break Things
Even in their IPO paperwork[http://mashable.com/2014/03/13/facebook-move-fast-break-things/]

=== Move Fast With Stable Infra ===
On 2014-04-30[http://mashable.com/2014/04/30/facebooks-new-mantra-move-fast-with-stability/], in a public announcement, Facebook changed their motto to:
* Move Fast With Stable Infra
