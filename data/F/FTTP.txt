'''<dfn>FTTP</dfn>''' is an acronym for Fiber to the Premises, also known as Fiber to the Home; an internet connectivity technology where a fiber optic line is run directly to a premises. It provides a symmetrical high bandwidth connection, and whilst initially prohibitively expensive, costs have now reduced and it is becoming more common.
