'''<dfn>[https://feedly.com/news-reader Feedly]</dfn>''' is a [[feed reader]] service.

== Features ==
(this section is a stub)

Feedly has common [[feed reader]] features:
* Subscribe to [[feed file]]s ([[RSS]], [[Atom]], [[JSON Feed]])
** how often does it poll?
* Can now subscribe to [[Bluesky]] accounts: ''[https://feedly.com/new-features/posts/bluesky Follow Bluesky users, and Bluesky feeds in Feedly]''

== IndieWeb Examples ==

Users â€” who uses Feedly.com?
* {{kartikprabhu}}
* {{chrisaldrich}}
* ...

== IndieWeb Friendly ==
Does Feedly support any IndieWeb [[building blocks]]? Could it support [[webactions]]? (It has a huge number of integrations for syndicating to other [[silos]].)
* ...

Advocacy: we should test whether any of the following are supported (e.g. like [[Woodwind]] does!), and if not, ask them to!
* Subscribe to [[h-feed]] feeds, including
** parsing [[h-entry]] posts for all their properties
** parsing <code>p-author [[h-card]]</code> for author name, image, home page
*** Feedly does not detect [[h-feed]] markup on pages (-{{kartik}} as of 2017-01-26)
* Receive [[WebSub]] notifications of feed updates
* [[IndieAuth]] to sign-in to feedly.com
*** Feedly does not allow [[Indieauth]] only Google, Facebook, Twitter, Windows, Evernote and a Feedly account (-{{kartik}} as of 2017-01-26)
* [[Micropub]] to [[like]] or [[bookmark]] items in feeds, and have those actions be posted to your own site.
* ...

== Issues ==
=== Union-busting employee surveillance ===

=== Fails To Handle Atom XHTML titles ===
See bug report:
* https://plus.google.com/110760594609453531817/posts/2J3wWDsJFnU
** 2015-08-26 appears to be fixed? https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/re-feedly-title-fix

Consider putting this for your [[Atom]] title element (inside the entry element) to help encourage users to encourage getting this bug fixed (and stay fixed! live regression tests are a good thing.)

<code style="white-space:pre-wrap"><nowiki>
<title type="xhtml">
<div class="if-your-feed-reader-displays-this-then-it-is-violating-the-Atom-spec-RFC-4287-section-4.2.14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
YOUR POST NAME GOES HERE
</div></title>
</nowiki></code>

=== No Offline Support ===

Feedly native app on Android (and iOS??) does not load anything when offline. So one cannot read posts even tough they had been previously downloaded.

=== Home page is js dr ===
(noticed 2017-026)

http://feedly.com/ is blank if javascript is disabled or fails to load ([[js;dr]]).

Upon loading it with JS, there's no reason the static logged-out content there couldn't be served directly from the server.
<blockquote>Welcome to Feedly<br/><br/>
The content you need to accelerate your research, marketing, and sales</blockquote>
etc.

=== Collapsed whitespace around HTML ===
{{gRegor}}: I had a friend report that the spaces around links in my feed were being collapsed, and the inline style for a striked-out word did not come through. Testing with {{tantek}}'s feed also shows the collapsed whitespace around links.
