'''<dfn>[https://www.firefox.com/ Firefox]</dfn>''' is an [[open source]] [[web browser]] made by [[Mozilla]] for current versions of Windows, [[macOS]] and Linux, as well as versions for [[iOS]] and [[Android]].

The open source community has released versions for older and other operating systems but they generally don't use the trademarked Firefox branding.

* to use a custom root certificate authority: at the bottom of about:preferences#privacy is the Certificates section and there’s a button to view certs. Then under Authorities import, and the key for me was to click the options button, which then shows the format type. That allowed me to choose certificate files, which then allows the file browser to recognize the iwc root cert file
* To file a bug, go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ and click the New Bug link/button
* How to disable the "Delete key goes back" keyboard shortcut: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1195262 (Why: because sometimes going back the forward can errantly lose information on fragile pages that use too much [[JS]] for their state, and it's too easy to think you're editing a text field, hit delete and watch the browser go "back" and lose your state)
* PowerPC Mac G3, G4, G5 support (requires Mac OS X 10.4.11 or later): https://www.floodgap.com/software/tenfourfox/ and https://github.com/BlackBirdLC/Aquafox/releases/ which is a fork of TenFourFox (supporting Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3)
