    '''<dfn>device-deaths</dfn>''' are like [[site-deaths]], except of physical devices made useless by their manufacturer or otherwise dependent service either explicitly shutting them down (bricking) or becoming inoperable due to the site-death of said service.

== Past ==
=== 2016 ===
==== Basis B1 ====
[[Basis]] announced they are shutting down their [[Basis B1]] watch and users have only til 2016-12-31 to retrieve their data per https://twitter.com/grapealope/status/790668650814513152

==== Revolv ====
2016-05-15 [[Revolv]] home automation hubs were shutdown. See [[site-deaths#Revolv]] for details.

=== 2014 ===
==== iPhone 4 ====
Apple it announced that iOS 8 and beyond will not work on the iPhone 4.  They also stopped patching iOS 7.  This, effectively, leaves the iPhone 4 "unsupported" by Apple.  As apps continue to release updates they will drop support for older iOS versions because they rely on features available in newer versions of iOS and there is a huge effort in backwards-compatible support for older SDK versions (e.g. the "Auto Layout" feature that helps adapt to various device screen sizes).  In a couple of years the iPhone 4 - locked to the Apple store and OS - will not be able to perform many of the functions their users relied on.
