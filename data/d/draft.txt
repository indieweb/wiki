A '''<dfn>draft</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb refers to a draft <em>[[post]]</em>, a post that an author has partially written, or otherwise does not consider finished.

== Why ==
Drafts are useful for private or semi-public sharing with others for review and feedback before official publication and [[POSSE]]ing.

Being able to save drafts has more than once saved me from posting something "in the heat of the moment" that I'd have later regretted. They can be a useful saucer for cooling off. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Some IndieWeb community members are using [[scheduling]] to publish drafts at otherwise public URLs, but not have them show up on their [[homepage]] (e.g. in their [[composite stream]]) or legacy [[feed file]].
* {{t}} I've been doing this for a few years. [[scheduling#Tantek]]
* [[MobilePub]] allows saving of posts locally, even when offline, then posting later when connected
* {{aaronpk}} supports draft posts on his site and with [[Quill]] [https://aaronparecki.com/2017/01/04/8/day-15-quill since 2017-01-04]

== Open Source Examples ==
=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] has a draft feature that allows you to save a draft and share a URL to a draft post which does not show up on your home page or any feeds. It has a [https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/other_notes/#2.2.-Pages-controller-methods status] field in the API that can be draft or publish

=== ProcessWire ===
[[ProcessWire]] has a published/unpublished flag that effectively allows writing a draft post that does not show up on your home page or any feeds. An unpublished page is visible only to logged in administrators at its permalink.

=== Known ===
[[Known]] has a public/private/members only access setting per post, so Private can be used as a Draft mode.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Kickstarter ===
[[Kickstarter]] supports sharing drafts of a campaign and includes a prompt at the top asking the viewer to submit feedback to the author.

=== Blogger ===
[[Blogger]] has a draft mode for posts, which the API exposes with an [https://developers.google.com/blogger/docs/3.0/reference/posts/insert isDraft parameter]

=== Twiitter ===
[[Twitter]] has a draft mode in its clients, but this is not reflected in the API

=== Medium ===
[[Medium]] has a [https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs#33-posts publishStatus] for posts that can be public, draft or unlisted whihc is accessible from the API

== Brainstorming ==
=== UI for many drafts ===
{{t}} '''use-case:''' I really need a better UI for keeping a big list of draft posts organized.

'''current workaround:''' right now I just braindump them all into a text file, which makes it hard to find a specific post when you want to iterate on it, and hard to find a set of related posts when you want to split / merge one or more posts into one or more related posts.

Design thoughts:

'''Three pane view:'''
<pre>+----+
|____|
| |  |
| |  |
+----+
</pre>

'''Top horizontal pane search box with a list of hashtags''' underneath in descending order of frequency (most to least frequent in existing drafts), and clicking them adds them to the search filter without losing keyboard focus, so you can keep typing. They act as whole "characters" inline so you can delete them as just by backspacing and they get added back to the frequency list.
<pre>
+-----------------------------+
|Search: [___________________]|
|(#indieweb) (#running (#css) |

+-----------------------------+
|Search: [(#indieweb)________]|
|(#running) (#css)            |
+-----------------------------+
</pre>
The hashtag buttons are key for lower-effort cluster discovery. Because of them I can just write a new note / post draft any time, put in hashtags, then come back later and quickly see which topics have the most drafts, and split/merge them accordingly into one or more posts.

'''Panes 2 & 3 side-by-side select list of drafts and editable content view.''' This is a classic list of drafts vs content editable view of a draft (or multiple if you select a range on the list side)


'''Prior similar work:''' [[Notational Velocity]], e.g. see [https://brettterpstra.com/uploads/2011/01/nvALT2.0Screenshot.jpg screenshot]. Appears to lack: hashtag cluster discovery, inline editing in pane 3.
