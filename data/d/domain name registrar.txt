A '''<dfn>domain name registrar</dfn>''' is an organization that will register [[domain names]] for you typically for an annual fee.

== Criteria ==
* Configurability - You should be able to set up all record types (A, CNAME, MX, TXT) for as many subdomains as you'd like/need.
* Email forwarding - does the registrar offer free email forwarding? This is useful if you want an @yourdomain.com email address that forwards to an existing account.  
* Auto-renew - it's easy to accidentally let a domain name registration expire; some registrars let you set up email reminders or an automatic renewal to prevent this from happening. 
* Domain Privacy - Note that most domain name registrars will make your personal information (name, mailing address, phone number and email address) publicly available via whois lookups. Some registrars offer domain privacy options, so that instead of your personal details the registrar's details will be in the whois directory. Only use domain privacy if you fully trust the provider of the service -- disputes about domain name administration or transfers may get tricky if you are not listed as the legal owner of the domain.
* Bundled hosting? Shop around for the best registrar and best host for your needs. They do not need to be the same.

== Opinions/Recommendations ==
* [[User:Kartikprabhu.com| Kartik Prabhu]]: uses [[NameCheap]]...
* {{aaronpk}} uses [[NameCheap]], dreamhost.com, and gandi.net, depending on TLD availability and price.
* [[User:kylewm.com| Kyle Mahan]]: uses name.com (as a registrar). Good prices, good UX, highly configurable.
* {{ rascul }} uses [https://gandi.net gandi.net]. Great service, often slightly more expensive than [[NameCheap]] but is (or at least was) the best price for .io TLD.
* [[User:Willnorris.com| Will Norris]]: uses [https://domains.google.com Google Domains].  As of 2014-06 it is still in limited beta, but I [https://willnorris.com/2014/06/google-domains highly recommend it].
* [[User:Bear.im| Bear]]: uses [https://www.hover.com Hover.com].
* {{gRegor}} uses [http://domainmonster.com Domain Monster]. Good prices, mediocre UX.
