{{stub}}

'''<dfn>data limits</dfn>''' are a limitation of some internet connections (such as wifi on some trains) that measure how much data you send & receive and limit it to a certain amount, and a good reason to both keep your page sizes small, use [[progressive enhancement]] for all scripts, and as a user, block unnecessary resources when browsing (such as all trackers & nearly all [[script]]s).

== Examples ==
=== CZ trains in Germany ===
Czech trains (with train numbers starting with "EC") have "CDWIFI" SSID with data limits in Germany (500MB in 1st class, 200MB in 2nd class).
