'''<dfn>data limits</dfn>''' are a limitation of some internet connections (such as wifi on some trains) that measure how much data you send & receive and limit it to a certain amount, and a good reason to both keep your page size small, as well as block unnecessary resources when browsing (such as all trackers & nearly all [[script]]s).
