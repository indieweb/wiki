The indieweb is '''<dfn>different</dfn>''' from previous efforts like blogging, federation, decentralization, etc.

== Beyond Blogging and Decentralization ==
While the IndieWeb shares many of its principles with other efforts/communities, yet there are some key aspects that '''<dfn>distinguish</dfn>''' the IndieWeb from previous efforts.

* '''[[Principles]] over project-centrism.''' There are many similar efforts that are based on a single (often open source) project. We believe a community developing a plurality of [[projects]] following a set of [[principles]] is more robust and produces better results than any such [[monoculture]].
* '''Make what you need. Use what you make.''' The best way to figure out what's most important, and actually build it, is to "[[scratch your own itch]]", by [[creating]] for and on your personal domain, then using it yourself for your personal needs ([[selfdogfood]]), and iterating.
* '''[[Design]] and UX first, formats/protocols second.''' We focus on UX first, and then as we figure that out we re-use/subset/implement/iterate/develop the absolutely simplest most minimal formats &amp; protocols necessary to support that UX.

== Indie but not a company ==
The IndieWeb is certainly [[indie]] and strongly supports independence and independents.

The IndieWeb is a [[community]] and a [[commons]], not a company.

The company "[[ind.ie]]" (with the ".") is pursuing "indie technology" and does re-use some indieweb principles, yet is distinct from the IndieWeb.

== Brainstorming ==
=== No blog is an island ===
{{t}}: “No blog is an island” is a call for a deliberate shift in perspective and summary expression that describes the following ways that IndieWeb blogs & sites interact with each other and people differently than historical authors-first commenters-second blogs.

Prior blogs / blogosphere:
* "old school author-centered blogs" are all about just the author(s) of the blog, where everyone else is a second class commenter

Blogs replying to each other / IndieWeb:
* The peer-to-peer vision of the IndieWeb reflects a present and future where everyone is an author of their own site, and comments/commentary are between sites, not a "gathering" or a "community" of secondary contributors in deference to a primary author/authority/site-owner.

Some amount of blog to blog conversation did take place in the early 2000s, especially around political topics, as a form of public debate and back & forth. Some of this conversation was facilitated by realtime blog link discovery services like [[Technorati]].

This phrase is also as an encouragement to figure out and support inter-blog connections (via [[Webmention]] etc.) rather than be so focused on "local comments" and the like.

In this regard, the IndieWeb philosophy is calling for a return to a more egalitarian and user/reader empowered vision of the web, where everyone can be and is treated as an author, even if only for short comments or remarks.
