'''<dfn>donation</dfn>''' is a rare type of post, often just a note, indicating an act of giving items or money to another person, or organization.

== Why ==
* Giving and philanthropy is good.
* Announcing or sharing your support on the web can encourage others to act. This might be similar to the [https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401 effect of announcing one's having registered to vote or announcing that they voted].

{{chrisaldrich}} has previously made a few checkin posts at donation shops like Goodwill or Salvation Army which include photos of some of my donations. Though those don't always have a complete list of things gotten rid of.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Twitter ===
* Circa 2011 (or perhaps even before) there was a Twitter movement by a number of non-profits to create a "Giving Tuesday" on the Tuesday following Black Friday and the subsequent Black Monday on the days following Thanksgiving in the United States. This resulted in people making status updates or [[note]] posts about donations they were making, typically with the [[hashtag]] [https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23givingtuesday #GivingTuesday].
