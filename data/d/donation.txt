'''<dfn>donation</dfn>''' is a rare type of post, often just a note, indicating an act of giving items or money to another person, or organization.

If you want to make a donation to the IndieWeb community, see:
* [[donate]]

== Why ==
* Giving and philanthropy is good.
* Announcing or sharing your support on the web can encourage others to act. This might be similar to the [https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401 effect of announcing one's having registered to vote or announcing that they voted].
* Repeat medical donors blood, marrow etc. might enjoy tracking milestones in the progress/total contribution over time, or comparing their donation history with others (e.g. [https://adactio.com/notes/17619 this note about giving blood] could perhaps have been a donation).

== Silo Examples ==
=== Twitter ===
* Circa 2011 (or perhaps even before) there was a Twitter movement by a number of non-profits to create a "Giving Tuesday" on the Tuesday following Black Friday and the subsequent Black Monday on the days following Thanksgiving in the United States. This resulted in people making status updates or [[note]] posts about donations they were making, typically with the [[hashtag]] [https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23givingtuesday #GivingTuesday].
