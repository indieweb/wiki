A '''<dfn>disclosure</dfn>''' is a bit of content, typically on a [[home page]], on an indie web site that proactively discloses some aspect about the site that the site owner wants the user to explicitly be aware of. E.g.

* cookie tracking
* analytics
* affiliations with organizations (sometimes on specific [[posts]] that are topically related to those organizations)
* services provided, such as webmentions
* privacy policy, as it involves the above
* contact information is anything in the disclosure is incorrect
* sustainability concerns

== Why ==

Having a disclosure on your site lets users know more about your principles. Whereas companies mainly use disclosures for legal reasons, a disclosure can let you inform visitors of the things you think they should know as a user. This is a good way to build trust with the users of a site.

Disclosures can be used whether or not you are processing user data. A disclosure could inform users that you have no intention to collect data. Alternatively, a disclosure could outline exactly what type of data you track, and why.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Jeremy Zilar ===
{{jeremyzilar}} on his [http://silencematters.com/ silencematters.com] sidebar, has a Google Analytics disclosure and links to opt out and learn more: <blockquote>Note:<br/>I use Google Analytics to understand how people are using my website.<br/>Opt-out | Learn more</blockquote>

=== Sebastiaan Andeweg ===
{{sebsel}} has a page on https://seblog.nl/privacy containing information about showing backfeed, citing posts, (no) tracking etc. since [https://seblog.nl/2017/02/18/2/day-34-privacy-policy 2017-02-18]. The page is linked in the footer of every page.

=== Daniel Goldsmith ===
{{dgold}} has a privacy policy page on [https://ascraeus.org/page/privacy/ ascraeus.org] setting out details on how he has implemented various privacy protection methods. The policy is linked in the footer of every page since [https://ascraeus.org/micro/1526833446/ 2018-05-20].

== Backfeed Examples ==
[[backfeed|Backfeed]], even from public silo profiles, may not be an obvious consequence by commenters/likers of [[POSSE]] copies. Thus it makes sense, especially for silo [[private account]]s and [[private post]]s by default, explicitly disclose on your silo profile that you are / may be backfeeding comments/likes etc. to your own site.

=== Kyle Mahan Instagram ===
{{kylewm}} has had a backfeed disclosure on his [[Instagram]] profile since 2015-??-??: <blockquote>heads up: images are also published on my personal site by #OwnYourGram. comments and likes are backfed by Brid.gy.</blockquote>

=== Tantek Facebook ===
{{t}} has had a backfeed disclosure on his [[Facebook]] profile "Intro" field since 2016-060: <blockquote>Posts here come from my site tantek.com <br/>Comments/likes may be copied to original posts & made public!</blockquote>

=== Kartik Prabhu Twitter ===
{{kartik}} has a backfeed disclosure on his [[Twitter]] profile since 2016-02-29: <blockquote>All responses backfed to my site. You have been warned!</blockquote>

=== Michael Bishop ===
{{miklb}} I have a pinned post on Twitter, and on 2017-07-18 made an announcement on Facebook to friends & family to assume all posts are public, reactions/comments backed to my personal domain. Also added disclosure to bio/intro.

== Silo Examples ==
Silo examples of disclosures nearly always mention some form of cookie tracking (and hopefully why), as well as one or more of the following:
* Cookies Policy
* Terms of Service (TOS)
* Privacy Policy
(additional specific research for each of those may deserve its own page)

=== Facebook ===
(this section is a stub, feel free to expand!)

Upon loading a Facebook profile page (perhaps any FB page) in Germany (having already been logged beforehand in the US), Facebook shows a cookie disclosure statement above their normal top of page toolbar:

[[File:2016-09-18-fb-cookies-disclosure.png]]

<blockquote>To help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies. By clicking or navigating the site, you agree to allow our collection of information on and off Facebook through cookies. Learn more, including about available controls: [https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/ Cookies Policy]</blockquote>

=== Twitter ===
(this section is a stub, feel free to expand!)

Upon visiting the Twitter homepage or a profile page (possibly all other pages to) in the Netherlands while being logged out, Twitter shows a cookie and data transfer disclosure statement in a floating alert box.

(and with Toolbar - note background based on profile page, since Twitter's disclosure is overlaid on top of the profile, instead of pushing it down)
[[File:2016-09-18-twitter-cookie-use.png]]

<blockquote>By using Twitter’s services you agree to our [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514 Cookie Use] and [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20174632 Data Transfer] outside the EU. We and our partners operate globally and use cookies, including for analytics, personalisation, and ads.</blockquote>

== Brainstorming ==
=== Disclosure Pages for Academia ===
[[Indieweb_for_Education|Researchers in academia]] are ethically required to make disclosures or conflicts of interest within journal articles they publish. Not doing so can be a career disrupting or even ending move. Why not add a Disclosure Page or Conflict of Interest Page on one's website to make it easier to cut and paste into journal submissions (when not practicing academic samizdat? It could have a list of current as well as past affiliations, along with dates, and potentially the value amounts paid (which are apparently available publicly in separate filings).
