'''<dfn>Device Auth</dfn>''' is an OAuth 2.0 extension for logging in on devices that have limited input options or no web browser. 

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* ...

The existing OAuth 2.0 Device Flow isn't enough to work in an IndieWeb context, since as it is currently described, the device first needs to know where the authorization server is to start the flow. In order to accomplish this when users bring their own authorization servers, the device would need a corresponding web service somewhere that could do the discovery part of [[IndieAuth]] in a browser.

== Use Cases ==
* a camera (or [https://aaronparecki.com/2015/07/09/10/flashair SD card]) that uploads every picture it takes to your website
* a [http://teradek.com/collections/vidiu-family hardware video encoder] that streams to your website instead of YouTube
* a picture frame that displays photos from people you're following in a [[reader]]
