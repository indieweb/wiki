{{stub}}

'''<dfn>destination</dfn>''' is the site where you want to publish a particular post when practicing [[multi-site indieweb]].

== Use Cases ==

[[Micropub]] allows a client to post to any site that has a Micropub endpoint. In theory, an individual use a Micropub client to post to multiple different sites.

* '''Posting different types of content to multiple personal sites.''' See [[multi-site indieweb]].
* '''Post to personal and organization or project site.'''
** {{martymcguire}} uses [[Screech]] to post [[podcast]] episodes for [https://martymcgui.re/podcasts/indieweb/ This Week in the IndieWeb Audio Edition] to his personal site, as well as episodes of his [https://wehavetoask.com/ comedy podcast] to its own site, which is also Micropub-enabled.

=== UX Issue ===

Most [[Micropub/Clients|Micropub clients]] only support logging in as, and posting to, one site at a time. This requires a user to log out and back in before posting to another site.

== Silo Examples ==

=== Facebook ===

[[Facebook]] allows users to create posts on behalf of a [[Facebook Page]]. The posting UI on a page allows users with permission to change the author of the post.

In particular when creating a post on FB, if you are able to act as a Page, then Facebook will explicitly prompt you for the "Destination" of your post:
