'''<dfn>display guidelines</dfn>''' are (sometimes also called <dfn>syndication policy</dfn>) instructions on a website for how other websites may or should (not) show information (like quotes, icons, other content) from that website, either in their entirety like a whole post, or excerpts, summaries, or citations thereof.

== Brainstorming ==
The idea: There should be standard markup and suggested styling for displaying information from other sites on your own.

=== Quote Guidelines ===
We should agree on best practices for marking up (and styling?) content quoted from other sites.

Quoting Embedding Display (QED) guidelines:
* Write IndieWeb versions of embedding/quoting display guidelines for when other sites display indie web posts/content
See: '''[[quoting]]''' for details and see [[reply-context]] for some thinking/progress.
