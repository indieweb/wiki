'''<dfn>display guidelines</dfn>''' are (sometimes also called <dfn>syndication policy</dfn>) instructions on a website for how other websites may or should (not) show information (like quotes, icons, other content) from that website.
* Counterpart: [[remote content policy]] â€” your policy about how you will treat or show content from other websites

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Twitter ===
Twitter has specific [https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements display <del>guidelines</del> requirements] for showing tweets on your site.

== Brainstorming ==
The idea: There should be standard markup and suggested styling for displaying information from other sites on your own.

=== Quote Guidelines ===
We should agree on best practices for marking up (and styling?) content quoted from other sites.

Quoting Embedding Display (QED) guidelines:
* Write IndieWeb versions of embedding/quoting display guidelines for when other sites display indie web posts/content
See: '''[[quoting]]''' for details and see [[reply-context]] for some thinking/progress.

=== People Guidelines ===
We should agree on best practices for representing people on your own site.

E.g.:
* [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats_2#h-card h-card], especially [http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats_2#minimal_markup minimal markup] h-cards
