A '''<dfn>digital garden</dfn>''' is a way of growing an online and typically public IndieWeb presence that focuses more on topics & relationships than a timeline like [[blogs]], has content of different levels of development, are imperfect and often public playgrounds for experimentation, learning, revising, iteration, and growth.

A digital garden is similar to a [[commonplace book]] however typically public rather than typically private (in general, though there are exceptions to each).
