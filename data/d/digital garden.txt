üå±ü™¥ A '''<dfn>digital garden</dfn>''' is a way of growing an online and typically public IndieWeb presence that focuses more on topics & relationships than a timeline like [[blogs]], has content of different levels of development, is imperfect and often a public playground for experimentation, learning, revising, iteration, and growth.

== Relation to commonplace book ==
A digital garden is similar to a [[commonplace book]], or sometimes considered a variant of the more generic meanings thereof. However in practice those that publish, grow, and curate a digital garden explicitly by name do so with common attributes that are not common to all "commonplace books" which is enough to distinguish digital gardens as their own thing.

== To-do ==
This page used to redirect to [[commonplace book]], and there are a lot of resources there specific to digital gardens that should be moved here.
