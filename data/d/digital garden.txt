A '''<dfn>digital garden</dfn>''' is a particular practice of creating & growing an online and public IndieWeb presence that focuses more on topics & relationships than a timeline like [[blogs]], has content of different levels of development, is imperfect and often a playground for experimentation, learning, revising, iteration, and growth for diverse content, perhaps interlinked with other digital gardens.

Similar personal site structures:
* [[commonplace book]]
* [[Zettelkästen]]

== Common Patterns ==
In her 2020 essay [https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden], Maggie Appleton observed that [https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#the-six-patterns-of-gardening digital gardens shared the following six patterns], many of which help distinguish them from [[blogs]], other forms of personal websites, or especially anything hosted on a corporate domain.
# 📑 Topography over Timelines
# 🌱🌿 Continuous Growth
# 🍂 Imperfection & Learning in Public
# 🎍 Playful, Personal, and Experimental
# 🌾 Intercropping & Content Diversity
# 🪴 Independent Ownership

== Relation to commonplace book ==
A digital garden is similar to a [[commonplace book]], or sometimes considered a variant of the more generic meanings thereof. However in practice those that publish, grow, and curate a digital garden explicitly by name do so with common attributes that are not common to all "commonplace books" which is enough to distinguish digital gardens as their own thing.
