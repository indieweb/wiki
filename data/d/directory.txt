https://indieweb.org/directory

== Why ==

[[Silo|Silos]] often provide [[recommendation engine|recommendation engines]] or ideas about [[who to follow]] to give their users content to [[readers|read]]. As IndieWeb adherents begin to own their own data on their own websites, they'll want services similar to these whether they are centralized or decentralized.
