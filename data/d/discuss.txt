== Add your icon ==
To have your [[icon]] or [[avatar]] show up on some of the platforms you'll need to add yourself to the list of [[chat-names]] (even if you're not using IRC). Due to some restrictions, avatars may not necessarily bridge across all platforms.

== Chat Channels Purposes ==
Each of our <span id="Chat_Channels">chat channels</span> has a specific purpose documented below.

If you‚Äôre not sure which channel to use, ask in <nowiki>#indieweb-meta</nowiki>!

=== indieweb ===
;<span id="indieweb_channel"><nowiki>#indieweb</nowiki> channel</span>
:Welcome to the indieweb! how to get on the indieweb, [[get started]], how to [[post]], what to post, indieweb [[events]] to join the community in-person, [[why]] indieweb, what software / services are ready for users to use without dealing with coding or command lines. 

'''Keep it user-centric please!'''

Not sure if you should ask a technical question here? Ask yourself:
* Could someone who has never built a website understand what you‚Äôre about to say/ask? 
** If not, please ask in the '''indieweb-dev''' channel instead!
** Everyone‚Äôs skill level and experience is different. Avoid words like ‚Äúsimple‚Äù, ‚Äújust‚Äù, ‚Äúobviously‚Äù, ‚Äúeasy‚Äù when explaining things. Such words may cause shame when people run into difficulty. Further reading is available in [https://css-tricks.com/words-avoid-educational-writing/ a blog post] written by Chris Coyier on words to avoid in educational reading.

If you see someone using [[jargon]], code, or dev talk, say something.

Politely request such conversations move to the dev channel (see below). We encourage the whole community to help with this, to keep the main chat friendly for newcomers and folks that want to focus on using the indieweb! And it helps avoid encounters like:
* https://twitter.com/klandwehr/status/977237843293720576
** "Recently joined the IndieWeb Slack and I feel like I‚Äôve entered a foreign country. The words I am reading are English but at times they make no sense.  The IndieWeb is just not ready for normals, but I sure hope it will be" [https://twitter.com/klandwehr @klandwehr] March 23, 2018

=== dev ===
;<span id="indieweb-dev_channel"><nowiki>#indieweb-dev</nowiki> channel</span> (#dev in Slack)
:Development tools, services (like [[Bridgy]]), issues, APIs, creating anything besides content, and any kind of [[jargon]]. E.g. creating [[design]], [[UX]], implementation details, protocols (like [[HTTP]], [[Webmention]], [[Micropub]], [[IndieAuth]]), formats (like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[microformats2]], [[h-entry]], [[h-card]], [[h-event]]), [[framework]]s, [[coding language]]s (like [[JS]], [[PHP]], [[Python]], [[Ruby]]), [[server]] configuration ([[Apache]], [[nginx]], [[HTTPS]]), and other [[plumbing]].

=== wordpress ===
;<span id="indieweb-wordress_channel"><nowiki>#indieweb-wordpress</nowiki> channel</span> (#wordpress in Slack)
:[[WordPress]]-specific topics ([[Getting Started on WordPress|Getting Started with WordPress]], IndieWeb WordPress plugins, WordPress themes, general WordPress development)

=== meta ===
;<span id="indieweb-meta_channel"><nowiki>#indieweb-meta</nowiki> channel</span> (#meta in Slack)
:Anything about the indieweb community or shared resources, and community organizing like [[events]]: [[planning]] events, wiki gardening, [[wikifying]], discussion about the community / [[discuss]]ion channels ([[IRC]], Slack, [[Loqi]]) / wiki.

=== chat ===
;<span id="indieweb-chat_channel"><nowiki>#indieweb-chat</nowiki> channel</span> (#chat in Slack)
:Off-topic channel for discussing anything, and is not publicly logged. Even though Slack has some number of lines of scrollback, this channel is considered off the record. It is the expectation of community members that this channel remains off the record. Explicit quoting or even summarizing someone should only occur after getting explicit permission.

== Related Chat Channels ==
Related channels often used by the community:'''

=== microformats channel ===
;<nowiki>#microformats</nowiki> (#microformats in Slack)
:Ask about [[microformats]] in general, or the process of developing a new one or new features by researching, documenting examples, brainstorming, etc.

=== known channel ===
;<nowiki>#indieweb-known</nowiki> (#known in Slack)
:Similar to the wordpress channel, the Known channel is for [[Known]]-specific topics (plugins, evolution, troubleshooting etc.)

== Slack Users ==
'''Slack users''': 
# [https://chat.indieweb.org/slack Join the IndieWeb Slack Community!]
# Join additional channels!
#* From the desktop: click the **Channels** heading in sidebar to view the other channels. Click a channel, i.e. # dev, it will show you a preview of that channel with a Join Channel button.

== Search ==
The chat rooms (except for #indieweb-chat) can be searched at
* https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/
* https://chat.indieweb.org/ (by typing into the search box and clicking the search icon which will redirect to the site above)

== People on IRC ==
{{main|chat-names}}

See our list of [[discuss|chat]] regulars sorted by nickname, with their website and usual timezone(s).

The channel has regular administrators, who are also wiki administrators. If you want to get their attention, just say "adminhelp".

== Activity ==
Anecdotally the channel seems quite active:
* 08:00-10:00 Pacific Time (-0800/-0700)
** 16:00-18:00 UK Time (+0000/+0100)
** 17:00-19:00 EU Time (+0100/+0200)

== Differences between chat services ==
Each of these four options is roughly equivalent from a text perspective, though each may have features, configurations, or other niceties that differentiate them somewhat from each other. 

Some platforms, like Slack, will unfurl URLs or provide a [[link-preview]] into the chat while others will allow wiki page names pre-pended with a slash to autolink to the exact wiki webpage (eg: "/principles" in some chat platforms will link to the [[principles]] wiki page). Slack emoji responses aren't bridged to other platforms, so giving a heart or thumbs up to someone's post won't be seen unless they're also on Slack. Depending on your chat client, users from Matrix may show up with a [m] on their usernames or users from Slack appear with their username in brackets. Some usernames may have the word "app" after them to indicate their content is originating from another platform. 

=== Keywords ===
People frequently in chat might like to be aware that many chat clients provide the ability to allow their users to be given real-time notifications when either their username or other specified keywords are used in individual channels. (Check the documentation of your chat client(s) for details.) This can be useful if one wants to engage in conversations around particular topics in chat. 

Many organizers and project developers will have turned on notifications for keywords related to [[project]]s they're actively working on or which they support. Other community members or volunteers may have notifications for particular topics/keywords on which they're an expert and are willing to provide pointers or support. Keep in mind and be respectful of the fact that almost everyone in chat is an unpaid volunteer and we're all on different work and personal schedules as well as in different timezones. Depending on how often people are in chat and whether or not they read all the logs, [[Loqi#Wiki|Loqi can be helpful for communicating across time and space]].

== Using an IRC client ==
# If you're already an IRC user, setup your client with:
#* Server: <code>irc.libera.chat</code>
#* Port: <code>6697</code> (usually default)
# [[discuss#Join_Discussions|Join the channels]] above (by clicking on the chat links)

See [https://libera.chat/guides/connect the libera.chat connect guide if you‚Äôre having trouble connecting].

== Email ==
There is no mailing list! üéâ 

This is a deliberate decision. We encourage focusing on short discussions in chat and capturing incremental agreements/disagreements on the wiki. This also discourages long essays and repetition of arguments that can take place on email threads.

For more see:
* [[FAQ#Is_there_an_IndieWeb_mailing_list|FAQ: Is there an IndieWeb mailing list]]

== Logs ==
If you prefer an email-like experience reading things in the past, see the current logs!

* https://chat.indieweb.org/today will display the current day‚Äôs discussion log.

=== Logs on Your iPhone Home Screen ===
To add the IRC logs to your iPhone home screen, visit the page below on your phone:

https://chat.indieweb.org/today?bookmark

=== Suggestions ===
We have the most awesome IRC logs on the web. That doesn't mean they can't be even more awesome. Got an idea, suggestion, or issue to report about the logs? Create or comment on a GitHub issue:
* https://github.com/indieweb/chat.indieweb.org/issues

== Why isn't there a channel for X? ==
Historically, the number of channels in the IndieWeb community chat has grown organically. From time to time we do add new channels, generally when there is a consistent level of discussion and conversation that either makes it overwhelming or potentially unwelcoming to carry on discussions related to specific topics. This is balanced against the possibility that a new chat channel would be either so quiet or infrequently used that asking questions or attempting to have a conversation there wouldn't be conducive or would result in people repeating the same question in multiple channels.

There is usually an annual conversation about adding new channels at the organizers' meeting at the IndieWeb Summit, though other conversations do happen throughout the year or can be brought up in the #indieweb-meta channel.

== 2021 IRC Migration ==
Due to the takeover of the Freenode IRC network, the Indieweb community decided to move our chat rooms over to [https://libera.chat/ libera.chat].

=== Status ===
* üü¢ libera.chat rooms are active
* üü¢ Web logs are configured to work with libera.chat
* üü¢ Web chat UI is configured to work with libera.chat
* üü¢ Slack bridge is configured to work with libera.chat
* üü¢ Matrix bridge working
* üü† freenode rooms are still available but no longer supported by the logs, web chat or slack.

=== Implications ===
If you access the chat using the Slack bridge or the chat.indieweb.org web UI, you should be able to continue using the chat as before.

If you access the chat via the Matrix bridge, you‚Äôll have to join the new matrix rooms linked above.

If you connect directly to IRC, [https://libera.chat/guides/connect set up your client to connect to libera.chat].

If you‚Äôre having trouble connecting to the new libera chat rooms, please try the following:
* Use the slack bridge or web chat to connect to the new rooms and get help
* Connect to the old freenode rooms and ask someone there for help; some community members will hang around there to assist with migration
* Edit this wiki page, add a list item under this with your issue and contact details
** e.g. here
* Tweet at [https://twitter.com/indiewebcamp @indiewebcamp]
