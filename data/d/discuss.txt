<b>Notice:</b> There is currently a [https://freenode.net/news/spambot-attack widespread spam attack] on the Freenode IRC network, so we have taken some additional anti-spam measures to keep our chat clear. 

Joining from the Slack or web gateways should work like normal. From IRC, only people marked as +v (indicated by a red dot or some other visual indicator in your IRC client) can speak in the channel. [[Loqi]] should manage this automatically, but if you think your messages aren't coming through, feel free to send a message to {{aaronpk}} on IRC or elsewhere

To have your [[avatar]] show up on some of the platforms you'll need to add yourself to the list of [[chat-names]] (even if you're not using IRC). Due to some restrictions, avatars may not necessarily bridge across all platforms.

== Chat Channels Purposes ==
Each of our <span id="Chat Channels">chat_channels</span> has a specific purpose documented below.

If you’re not sure which channel to use, ask in <nowiki>#indieweb-meta</nowiki>!

=== indieweb channel ===
;<nowiki>#indieweb</nowiki>
:Welcome to the indieweb! how to get on the indieweb, [[get started]], how to [[post]], what to post, indieweb [[events]] to join the community in-person, [[why]] indieweb, what software / services are ready for users to use without dealing with coding or command lines. <br/>Keep it user-centric please! Find someone using [[jargon]], code, or dev talk? Politely invite them to ask / discuss in the dev channel (see below).
=== indieweb-dev channel ===
;<nowiki>#indieweb-dev</nowiki> (#dev in Slack)
:Development tools, services (like [[Bridgy]]), issues, APIs, creating anything besides content, and any kind of [[jargon]]. E.g. creating [[design]], [[UX]], implementation details, protocols (like [[HTTP]], [[Webmention]], [[Micropub]], [[IndieAuth]]), formats (like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[microformats2]], [[h-entry]], [[h-card]], [[h-event]]), [[framework]]s, [[coding language]]s (like [[JS]], [[PHP]], [[Python]], [[Ruby]]), [[server]] configuration ([[Apache]], [[nginx]], [[HTTPS]]), and other [[plumbing]].
=== indieweb-wordpress channel ===
;<nowiki>#indieweb-wordpress</nowiki> (#wordpress in Slack)
:[[WordPress]]-specific topics ([[Getting Started on WordPress|Getting Started with WordPress]], IndieWeb WordPress plugins, WordPress themes, general WordPress development)
=== indieweb-meta channel ===
;<nowiki>#indieweb-meta</nowiki> (#meta in Slack)
:Anything about the indieweb community or shared resources, and community organizing like [[events]]: [[planning]] events, wiki gardening, [[wikifying]], discussion about the community / [[discuss]]ion channels ([[IRC]], Slack, [[Loqi]]) / wiki.
=== indieweb-chat channel ===
;<nowiki>#indieweb-chat</nowiki> (#chat in Slack)
:Off-topic channel for discussing anything, and is not publicly logged. Even though Slack has some number of lines of scrollback this channel is considered off the record. It is the expectation of community members that this channel remains off the record. Explicit quoting or event summarizing someone should only occur after getting explicit permission. 

== Related Chat Channels ==
Related channels often used by the community:'''
=== microformats channel ===
;<nowiki>#microformats</nowiki> (#microformats in Slack)
:Ask about [[microformats]] in general, or the process of developing a new one or new features by researching, documenting examples, brainstorming, etc.
=== knownchat channel ===
;<nowiki>#knownchat</nowiki> (#known in Slack)
:Similar to the wordpress channel, the Known channel is for [[Known]]-specific topics (plugins, evolution, troubleshooting etc.)

== Slack Users ==
'''Slack users''': 
# [https://chat.indieweb.org/slack Join the IndieWeb Slack Community!]
# Join additional channels!
#* From the desktop: click the **Channels** heading in sidebar to view the other channels. Click a channel, i.e. # dev, it will show you a preview of that channel with a Join Channel button.

== Search ==
The chat rooms (except for #indieweb-chat) can be searched at
* https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/
* https://chat.indieweb.org/ (by typing into the search box and clicking the search icon which will redirect to the site above)

== Differences between chat services ==
Each of these four options is roughly equivalent from a text perspective, though each may have features, configurations, or other niceties that differentiate them somewhat from each other. 

Some platforms, like Slack, will unfurl URLs or provide a [[link-preview]] into the chat while others will allow wiki page names pre-pended with a slash to autolink to the exact wiki webpage (eg: "/principles" in some chat platforms will link to the [[principles]] wiki page. Slack emoji responses aren't bridged to other platforms, so giving a heart or thumbs up to someone's post won't be seen unless they're also on Slack. Depending on your chat client, users from Matrix may show up with a [m] on their usernames or users from Slack appear with their username in brackets. Some usernames may have the word "app" after them to indicate their content is originating from another platform. 

== Using an IRC client ==
# If you're already an IRC user, setup your client with:
#* Server: <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
#* Port: <code>6697</code> (usually default)
# [[discuss#Join_Discussions|Join the channels]] above (by clicking on the chat links)

== Email ==
There is no mailing list! 🎉 

This is a deliberate decision. We encourage focusing on short discussions in chat and capturing incremental agreements/disagreements on the wiki. This also discourages long essays and repetition of arguments that can take place on email threads.

** "Recently joined the IndieWeb Slack and I feel like I’ve entered a foreign country. The words I am reading are English but at times they make no sense.  The IndieWeb is just not ready for normals, but I sure hope it will be" [https://twitter.com/klandwehr @klandwehr] March 23, 2018
