<b>Notice:</b> There is currently a [https://freenode.net/news/spambot-attack widespread spam attack] on the Freenode IRC network, so we have taken some additional anti-spam measures to keep our chat clear. 

Joining from the Slack or web gateways should work like normal. From IRC, only people marked as +v (indicated by a red dot or some other visual indicator in your IRC client) can speak in the channel. [[Loqi]] should manage this automatically, but if you think your messages aren't coming through, feel free to send a message to {{aaronpk}} on IRC or elsewhere

== Join Discussions ==
Join the discussions! The IndieWeb chat is bridged equivalently across four different chat services so that users can choose the modality that works best for their needs.

** '''[https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#freenode_#indieweb:matrix.org Matrix bridge to #indieweb chat (via riot.im)]'''

To have your [[avatar]] show up on some of the platforms you'll need to add yourself to the list of [[chat-names]] (even if you're not using IRC). Due to some restrictions, avatars may not necessarily bridge across all platforms.

== Chat Channels ==
Each of our chat channels has a specific purpose documented below. If youâ€™re not sure which channel to use, ask in <nowiki>#indieweb-meta</nowiki>!

;<nowiki>#indieweb</nowiki>
:Welcome to the indieweb! how to get on the indieweb, [[get started]], how to [[post]], what to post, indieweb [[events]] to join the community in-person, [[why]] indieweb, what software / services are ready for users to use without dealing with coding or command lines. <br/>Keep it user-centric please! Find someone using [[jargon]], code, or dev talk? Politely invite them to ask / discuss in the dev channel (see below).
;<nowiki>#indieweb-dev</nowiki> (#dev in Slack)
:Creating anything besides content, discussing any kind of [[jargon]]. E.g. creating [[design]], [[UX]], implementation details, protocols (like [[HTTP]], [[Webmention]], [[Micropub]], [[IndieAuth]]), formats (like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[microformats2]], [[h-entry]], [[h-card]], [[h-event]]), [[framework]]s, [[coding language]]s (like [[JS]], [[PHP]], [[Python]], [[Ruby]]), [[server]] configuration ([[Apache]], [[nginx]], [[HTTPS]]), and other [[plumbing]].
;<nowiki>#indieweb-wordpress</nowiki> (#wordpress in Slack)
:[[WordPress]]-specific topics ([[Getting Started on WordPress|Getting Started with WordPress]], IndieWeb WordPress plugins, WordPress themes, general WordPress development)
;<nowiki>#indieweb-meta</nowiki> (#meta in Slack)
:Anything about the indieweb community or shared resources, and community organizing like [[events]]: [[planning]] events, wiki gardening, [[wikifying]], discussion about the community / channels / wiki.
;<nowiki>#indieweb-chat</nowiki> (#chat in Slack)
:Off-topic channel for discussing anything, and is not publicly logged. Slack has some number of lines of scrollback.

'''Related channels often used by the community:'''
;<nowiki>#microformats</nowiki> (#microformats in Slack)
:Ask about [[microformats]] in general, or the process of developing a new one or new features by researching, documenting examples, brainstorming, etc.
;<nowiki>#knownchat</nowiki> (#known in Slack)
:Similar to the wordpress channel, the Known channel is for [[Known]]-specific topics (plugins, evolution, troubleshooting etc.)
;<del><nowiki>#bridgy</nowiki> (#bridgy in Slack)</del>
:<del>No longer active. Was [[Bridgy]] discussion and user support.</del> Use <nowiki>#indieweb-dev</nowiki> instead!

'''Slack users''': to join additional channels from the desktop, click the **Channels** heading in sidebar to view the other channels. Click a channel, i.e. # dev, it will show you a preview of that channel with a Join Channel button.

== Search ==
The chat rooms (except for #indieweb-chat) can be searched at
* https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/
* https://chat.indieweb.org/ (by typing into the search box and clicking the search icon which will redirect to the site above)

== Differences between chat services ==
Each of these four options is roughly equivalent from a text perspective, though each may have features, configurations, or other niceties that differentiate them somewhat from each other. 

Some platforms, like Slack, will unfurl URLs or provide a [[link-preview]] into the chat while others will allow wiki page names pre-pended with a slash to autolink to the exact wiki webpage (eg: "/principles" in some chat platforms will link to the [[principles]] wiki page. Slack emoji responses aren't bridged to other platforms, so giving a heart or thumbs up to someone's post won't be seen unless they're also on Slack. Depending on your chat client, users from Matrix may show up with a [m] on their usernames or users from Slack appear with their username in brackets. Some usernames may have the word "app" after them to indicate their content is originating from another platform. 

== Using an IRC client ==
# If you're already an IRC user, setup your client with:
#* Server: <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
#* Port: <code>6697</code> (usually default)
# [[discuss#Join_Discussions|Join the channels]] above (by clicking on the chat links)

== Email ==
There is no mailing list! ðŸŽ‰ 

This is a deliberate decision. We encourage focusing on short discussions in chat and capturing incremental agreements/disagreements on the wiki. This also discourages long essays and repetition of arguments that can take place on email threads.
