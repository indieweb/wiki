{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>data limit</dfn>''' is a restriction on some internet connections (such as free wifi on some trains) that measures how much data you send & receive, caps it at a certain amount, and a good reason to keep page sizes small & use [[progressive enhancement]] as a developer, and block unnecessary resources when browsing (such as all trackers & nearly all [[script]]s) as a user.

== Examples ==
=== CZ trains in Germany ===
Czech trains (with train numbers starting with "EC") have "CDWIFI" SSID with data limits in Germany (500MB in 1st class, 200MB in 2nd class).
