** "Prediction: Mastodon will likely outlast Twitter.Historically, decentralized, open-source platforms and protocols with any adoption run forever, even if they rarely reach the popularity or cultural relevance of centralized platforms.It seems likely to me that when Twitter eventually shuts down, people will still be running Mastodon instances.Did you know Diaspora has 328 active nodes and 17k users? Hell, there are 3,652 active FidoNet nodes, and that started in 1984!So... am I wrong?" [https://xoxo.zone/@andybaio @andybaio] April 7, 2017
