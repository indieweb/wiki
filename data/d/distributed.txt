'''<dfn>distributed</dfn>''' is an adjective used to describe a system of nodes that are able to interact peer-to-peer without a centralized authority, or even a [[decentralized]] hierarchy, is the basis of [[DiSo]], and what is exemplified by use of [[Webmention]] and [[microformats2]] [[building blocks]] to [[federate]] [[responses]] directly between people using their own indieweb sites.

== Examples ==
* Though Andy says "decentralized", the examples he provides are all of *distributed* nodes: https://xoxo.zone/@andybaio/12626
** "Prediction: Mastodon will likely outlast Twitter.Historically, decentralized, open-source platforms and protocols with any adoption run forever, even if they rarely reach the popularity or cultural relevance of centralized platforms.It seems likely to me that when Twitter eventually shuts down, people will still be running Mastodon instances.Did you know Diaspora has 328 active nodes and 17k users? Hell, there are 3,652 active FidoNet nodes, and that started in 1984!So... am I wrong?" [https://xoxo.zone/@andybaio @andybaio] April 7, 2017

* Note: web-based systems of nodes that are distributed per the definition but still use [[DNS]] to route and initiate connections with each other could be arguably said to all still have a [[decentralized]] dependency (of DNS) and thus related vulnerabilities / limitations. If such systems allow for peer-to-peer alternatives to DNS, then they may be hybrid systems.
