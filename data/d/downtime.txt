'''<dfn>downtime</dfn>''' is the time period or duration while a site, whether indieweb, [[commons]], or [[silo]], is offline and unreachable.

For a period of hours, due to [http://status.linode.com/incidents/2rm9ty3q8h3x lengthy problems including power outage at the hosting provider], IndieWebCamp.com and various related services like IndieAuth.com were down and unreachable.
