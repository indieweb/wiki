'''<dfn>Developer Frequently Asked Questions</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>developer FAQ</dfn>) are questions about the IndieWeb and IndieWebCamp that are more focused on the underlying technologies, [[standards]], [[jargon]], [[code]] than user-functionality.

See '''[[FAQ]]''' for more general, user-centric questions about the IndieWeb.

== Why can no one make something consumer friendly ==
"Q: Why can't someone make something consumer friendly then?"[https://www.facebook.com/billt/posts/10152707921079618?comment_id=10152708141739618]

A: Because they can't even make something [[eat what you cook|self-friendly]], that is, something that they themselves will use, daily, and thus continuously improve.

There are a growing number of creators & builders who are making self-friendly sites, services, and software, here in the IndieWeb community, and few elsewhere as well.

== Who are we making software for ==
"Q: Who are we making software for?"

A: [[make what you need|Make software for yourself]] which you use daily and rely on, before targeting some other demographic.([https://chat.indieweb.org/2013-08-21/1377126875000 originally answered 2013-08-21])

And use it publicly on your personal site - that will motivate you to continuously iterate and improve it.

Share what you learn in the process. Post on your site, share briefly on [[discuss|chat]], contribute to wiki.

By doing so we are together building a diverse plurality of software and systems that interoperate, by starting with our own individual & varied [[UX]] needs, wants, and specific real-world personal use-cases to derive the minimal protocols & formats necessary.

== How should I markup my site ==
"Q: How should I markup my site?"

A: Use a classic [[microformat]] on the body of each page.  For your index page, use an [[h-card]].  For your individual permalink pages, use [[h-entry]].

For all of the data on your pages, use [[microformats2]].

== What are IndieWebCamp specifications ==
"Q: What specs does IndieWebCamp handle?"

A: The IndieWebCamp community develops several widely implemented specifications, including [[IndieAuth]], [[Webmention]], and [[Micropub]]. Additional specifications (like [[Microsub]] and [[Vouch]]) are in development. Lastly, IndieWebCamp also makes heavy (re-)use of [[microformats]] specifications.

See [[specifications]] for a longer list of essential IndieWebCamp specifications, both developed here in the community, and heavily (re-)used from other communities.

== Any books or posts on federated networks ==
''Q: Do you have any good books / posts you would recommend on the subject of federated networks?''

A: There are no good books on the subject of [[federated]] networks, yet. There are very few actually good established federated networks, beyond perhaps the old NNTP networks. [[Email]] had a glimmer of federation but became an oligopoly (largely due to economies of scale addressing overwhelming [[spam]]), and is nearly impossible for new sites to federate. Chat networks with XMPP had an even briefer glimmer until major services abandoned their XMPP support. 

There is some hope for the growing [[Matrix]] chat federated network, and the growing network of [[Mastodon]] and other [[ActivityPub]] compatible services, including many IndieWeb sites which federate directly or via [[BridgyFed]]. However both of these federated networks are dominated by their own primary implementation and thus at risk of all the downsides of software [[monoculture]]s.

There are many aspirational posts about federated social networks (e.g. [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/introduction-distributed-social-network]) but few and far between are actual good posts about them. Here is a list of a few:
