{{stub}}

'''<dfn>dunking</dfn>''' is in [[social media]] a particular (ab)use of [[quote]] posts, popularized using [[Twitter]]'s [[quote tweet]] feature, to quote a post with a comment intended to at a minimum refute the quoted post, though often to also mock or otherwise denigrate, sometimes in an attempt to appear wittier and garner more [[reaction]]s ([[like]]s and [[reposts]]).

== Blocking Dunking ==
The target of a normal "dunking" on [[Twitter]] can stop future "dunks" from that dunker by [[block]]ing them. This has the additional effect of rendering their original tweet as "This tweet is unavailable" inside any existing "dunk tweets" from that dunker, thereby removing context and substantially reducing the apparent cleverness or appeal of the dunk.

As a workaround, dunkers switched to screenshot dunking.

== Screenshot Dunking ==
(move to its own page if significant enough to split apart)

'''<dfn>Screenshot dunking</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Screencap dunking</dfn>) is variant of dunking where the dunker posts an image (screenshot) of the original post they mean to quote / dunk, thereby bypassing any mechanisms to block or otherwise prevent such dunking of (otherwise) public posts.
