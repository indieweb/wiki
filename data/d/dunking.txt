'''<dfn>dunking</dfn>''' is in [[social media]] a particular (ab)use of [[quote]] posts, popularized using [[Twitter]]'s [[quote tweet]] feature, to quote a post with a comment intended to at a minimum refute the quoted post, though often to also mock or otherwise denigrate, sometimes in an attempt to appear wittier and garner more [[reaction]]s ([[like]]s and [[reposts]]).
