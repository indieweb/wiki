[[granary]] converts podcast h-feeds and h-entries to RSS with enclosures, including iTunes extension elements.

It reads episode duration from the <code>duration</code> and <code>length</code> mf2 properties, and supports both integer seconds and ISO 8601 duration values. It emits the <code>duration</code> mf2 property with integer seconds value. [https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/169 Background discussion].
