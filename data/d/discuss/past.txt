=== events meetups channel ===
{{section-stub}}
There is a desire for a new channel, for simplicity by default like nearly all other new channels, logged, indexed, with web access, for use by folks before or at events or meetups, in-person or virtual, for potentially real-time and/or rapid chat about an event or related socializing & logistics.

Discussion: this has come up most recently on [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-03-08 2024-03-08] and has come up a few times in chat in the past (citations would help!).
* [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-02-15#t1708020173101600 2024-02-15]
* [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-03-13#t1710366842620800 2024-03-13]

Use-cases:
* A dedicated place to see event start and end notifications
** 10 minutes before scheduled zoom meeting
** a notification when the actual zoom call ends
* A clear place to chat instead of Zoom during virtual or hybrid events!
** We turn off Zoom chat in the IndieWeb Zooms, so it would be great if there was a singular clear chat channel to use specifically during such events that we could link to, and direct people to in Zooms.
** The name of the channel should be easily speakable/hearable, so folks can find/join with minimal effort
* ... extract more from [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-03-08#t1709932205046300 meta chat logs 2024-03-08]

Pros:
* separate out the discussion that happens during a zoom or in-person event
** online discussions can continue without worrying about stepping on the toes of in-person/zoom discussions
** a place to share links during a zoom meeting where it's ok that there's no context in chat (e.g. multiple instances of a link being dropped in the chat that appears as a sequitur because there was no prior discussion in chat because the discussion was on zoom)
* when you're in person, you often want a high signal channel to get updates on scheduling or where the group is heading after the main event, etc


Cons:
* one more place to catch up on scrollback. (which is also a pro: easy to skim and ignore all scrollback if you aren't interested)

Prior art (other communities' channel names/purposes for events and meetups)
* '''#meetup''' in Discord in the Escape Hatch (EH) community for planning IRL meetups and coordinating when in the same town - {{t}}
* '''#live-stream-chat''' in Discord in the EH community for backchannel chat during a shared live video stream. - {{t}} ([https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-02-15#t1708020275917100 more])
* '''#voice-text-chat''' — {{gRegor}}: "A Discord I'm in has a channel #voice-text-chat for when people are hanging out in the voice channel for an event. It works pretty well for dropping links, gif reactions, side-chat, and allows non-verbal people to participate." [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-02-15#t1708020986282200]

==== events meetups naming ====
Proposed names: (all names would have the "indieweb-" prefix in IRC and Discord, and no prefix in Slack, 
* '''#events'''
** +1 {{t}} — have changed my mind on this. clear, and also will provide a nicer/friendlier home for chat about, before, during, and after events instead of the #meta channel. This is my preferred option.
** +1 {{aaronpk}} - clear and straightforward
** +1 {{murray}} - agreed, feels the most simplistic/expected
** +1 {{pesce}} - generic so it can be used for any event
** 0 {{gwg}} - I like the idea, but I'm worried the name may be seen as being about events, which we usually talk about in meta over it is active during events. But I think it could work.
** +1 {{aciccarello}} - Seems clearest to me. Might need some education that event planning should be in #meta as {{GWG}} mentioned.
** +1 {{mat.tl}}
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* '''#live'''
** +0 {{aaronpk}} - adding this because we did use indieweb.live to livestream one or two indiewebcamp events in the past
** +1 {{gwg}} - I think this may be better than the other choices because it expressly says this is onyl used during a live event.
** +1 {{t}} - this one clearly indicates connection to a currently live event, however might be too specific. maybe we can start with #events and see if we still need a channel for "live" in particular?
** +0 {{aciccarello}} - I'd prefer #events but this makes sense too
** +1 {{mat.tl}}
** +1 {{jimw}} - clear that is for live events, not discussion about events
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* '''#meetup'''
** +0 {{t}} - ok alternative to "events" but sounds too informal, and also agree with aaronpk that may sound too specific too.
** +0 {{aaronpk}} - sounds too specific, like an in-person event, we only call events "meetups" when they are [https://events.indieweb.org/tag/meetup in person, usually adjacent to another event]
** -1 {{aciccarello}} - Too specific to a format
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

=== off the record channel ===
The problems with the "chat" channel were documented in the proposal for the "random" channel.

While the new "random" channel isn't logged to the web archives, it is still persistent in Discord and Slack. 

Having a channel with even less persistent history is still quite useful for many use-cases where something may have some realtime relevance but not within days.

This was previously discussed in 2016, but did not reach a conclusion. https://indieweb.org/rename_to_IndieWeb#non-log_based_IRC_chat_stuff

This proposal is to rename the #indieweb-chat channel (#chat on Slack), or preferably start fresh with a <span id="new-off-the-record">new off the record</span> channel and close #indieweb-chat, since #indieweb-chat has been going for a long time and likely has a number of abandoned accounts, bouncers, and bots in it (which may be defeating the off the record purpose).

This (new) channel would:
* still be bridged between Slack/Discord/IRC
* not available to join from the web client at chat.indieweb.org
* not logged to the chat archives
* Slack automatically will delete messages after 90 days (we do not get control over this)
* a Discord bot will delete messages after X days (should this match the 90 days of slack? not sure if there are any limitations on how long bots can delete messages for)
** 1 day — {{t}}, that should be sufficient for the intent of this channel. Could live with up to 4 days for folks that want to ignore chat for a (long) weekend for example but still see @-mentions (though maybe we set a culture of using <kbd>!tell</kbd> here instead of @-mentions for folks that haven't spoken recently).
* Note that IRC itself is not logged centrally, but an individual's IRC client may log messages indefinitely and we have no control over that.
** {{t}}: we could have a bot that kicks IRC nicks that have been quiet/inactive for say a month
** {{aaronpk}}: +1 to that idea!

==== off the record naming ====
* #indieweb-backchannel
** +1 {{mat.tl}}
** +0 {{t}} — an older reference but not opposed
** +1 {{jimw}}
** -0 {{aaronpk}} - sounds too technical
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-breeze
** +0 {{t}} because posts here are gone with the wind
** -0 {{aciccarello}} good for a laugh 😆
** -0 {{martymcguire}} (would increase this is vaporwave music plays while the channel is open)
** +1 {{mat.tl}}
** -1 {{aaronpk}} requires too much explanation
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-cafe
** +1 {{t}} — broader than *-espresso. conversations in a cafe have very little (expected) history, you may overhear things while you're in line to order, before you join a table to talk with folks, and you don't expect to see/hear any chat in the cafe once you have left the cafe.
** +1 {{gRegor}} proposed this half-jokingly in response to -espresso, but I like the analogy of chill vibes, socializing, and usually lots of people on laptops.
** +1 {{aciccarello}} I'm down for communicating a good vibes space as long as it's clear to others
** 0 {{aaronpk}} it's cute, my worry is that it's not explicitly clear the difference from "random". 
** +1 {{starrwulfe}} I like cafes. When I lived in a smaller apartment, I would treat the local indie cafes like my living room. A real third place. Encourages a space to discuss and relax. 
** +1 {{martymcguire}} cafes have historically been incubators of social revolution. 😏
** +1 {{to2ds}} okay, this one is starting to grow on me, though it doesn't seem to imply "not logged."
** +1 {{marksuth}} this reflects the casual group conversation style we have in HWC, and I like cafes.
** +0 {{capjamesg}}
** +1 {{mat.tl}}
** +0 {{jimw}}
** +1 {{catgirlinspace}} sounds cute :3
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-chill
** +1 {{t}} — along the lines of *-cafe and *-vibes, a place to chill, not be beholden to rules of what belongs here and what doesn't. encourages calm conversations to escape anything formal. you can relax more because it's considered off the record and nothing you say is expected to be cited or quoted. Encourages chill vibes.
** +0 {{aciccarello}}
** -1 {{martymcguire}} this channel is where folks in heated discussions are sent to cool off
** +1 {{mat.tl}}
** -1 {{aaronpk}} agreed with schmarty
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-cybercafe
** +1 {{t}} — aligned with late [[1990s]] vibes, plus {{mattl}} said he'd love this
** +1 {{mat.tl}}
** +1 {{catgirlinspace}} sounds cool,,,
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-ephemera
** +1 {{t}} sounds intellectual and makes me people ask what that means so they have to actually go look it up and learn
** +0 {{gRegor}} fun, but not to be confused with indieweb-chimera ;)
** -1 {{aciccarello}} seems too intellectual and not very inviting
** +1 {{claudinec}} as an archivist I'm quite fond of this word and I think it's the most accurate out of all the options
** -1 {{martymcguire}} "sounds intellectual" feels like an anti-goal to me. if this then let's really lean into it and go for #indieweb-esoterica
** +0 {{0x3b0b}} one of the only suggestions that I'd have guessed the intent of correctly before seeing the discussions or visiting it, but I get where {{aciccarello}} and {{martymcguire}} are coming from.
** -1 {{mat.tl}} 
** +0 {{catgirlinspace}} it's a big word...
** -1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-espresso
** +0 {{t}} half-serious, it's cute, and because it's meant for small things that disappear quickly, or you have to consume promptly
** -1 {{martymcguire}} espresso is too intense for me. i need extra liquid to slow me down before i drink the whole thing.
** -1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-hangout
** +1 {{starrwulfe}} I'm a sucker for the "does what it says on the tin" kind of labels. A "hangout" is a place where you can hang out and chat, just lurk and listen, vibe, nap, play games, do random whatever.
** +0 {{martymcguire}} i like a good hangout (event) but a hangout (place) gets dingy.
** -1 {{aaronpk}} almost makes it sound like the default place to be
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-offtherecord
** +1 {{aaronpk}} makes it clear this is not logged, possibly a bit long of a name tho
** +0 {{martymcguire}} this is fine
** -1 {{t}} It's not totally horrible, but it's not good either. It sounds legalistic / formal. It violates the [[fun]] principle. It's also direct enough of a name to attract trolls with an intent to grief and defeat the purpose of the channel.
** +0 {{aciccarello}} descriptive but also a mouthful...
** +1 {{alabut}} This is the only name that says what it does in such an obvious way that you understand it without having to look it up in the wiki. Introducing extra steps is a UX obstacle, plus a good rule of thumb for naming (or features in general) is to not need a manual to understand it.
** +1 {{0x3b0b}} I echo essentially all of what {{alabut}} said. Unfortunately I also agree with {{t}} about the potential for trolls to be drawn to it like a bridge.
** +1 {{mat.tl}} -- would be fine with #indieweb-otr too
** +1 {{jimw}} seems most clear about the intention
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-offtopic
** +1 {{aaronpk}} I've seen "offtopic" channels in other communities. Not explicitly unlogged, but at least is implied since it's for offtopic topics
** +1 {{martymcguire}} I like the encouragement in the name to move "on topic" conversations out of here.
** -1 {{t}} is not named for the purpose of the channel. Worse, adds confusion with random as {{aaronpk}} said above for indieweb-cafe: <blockquote>my worry is that it's not explicitly clear the difference from "random"</blockquote> and as noted previously, "offtopic" feels corporate-jargon or tech-communication-centric jargon to me. It's not horrible, but it's not good either. It violates the [[fun]] principle.
** +1 {{aciccarello}} probably my top pick. Seems clear to me (not jargony).
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-raindrops
** +0 {{t}} because you only see and feel raindrops for moments, you have can't see past raindrops
** -1 {{martymcguire}} it's damp in here.
** +0 {{0x3b0b}} I wouldn't have inferred the intent from the name, but unlike some of the other proposals for which that is also true, I wouldn't be likely to forget it and I find the idea actively pleasant.
** -1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-snap
** +0 {{t}} half-serious, the kids know what 'snap' implies
** -1 {{aciccarello}} ''[old man yells at cloud]'' who brought the silo in here?
** +0 {{martymcguire}} would love for this to be a "lite" version of -dev for helping folks assemble IndieWeb building blocks.
** -1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* '''#indieweb-tmp'''
** +1 {{mattl}} -- make it very clear this is temp
** +1 {{to2ds}} -- love this option for it's simplicity.
** -1 {{t}} — too unix jargony

* #indieweb-vanishing
** -1 {{aaronpk}} "vanishing" sounds like the messages need to disappear faster than we are able to make them disappear in slack
** -1 {{martymcguire}} this room is for discussing how to hide in plain sight 🥷
** -1 {{t}} sounds like overpromising
** -1 {{aciccarello}} considering how long Slack messages stick around, I agree it over-promises
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}

* #indieweb-vibes
** +0 {{t}} vibes are also ephemeral
** -1 {{aciccarello}} somehow feels intimidating; like I need to share something really cool to chat
** -1 {{martymcguire}} doesn't pass the vibe check.
** -1 {{aaronpk}}
** +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}}


==== random channel for informal ====
The naming of #indieweb-chat was largely an accident/convenience (not an agreed decision, [[rename_to_IndieWeb##indieweb-chat|majority was actually against]]!) back from the days of when we had #indiewebcamp and #indiechat, and switched everything to be #indieweb-* prefixed.

It was important for the context/culture of the time for indiechat to not be logged or provide any lengthy history.

Informal (sometimes offtopic) chatter is helpful for friendlier community building.

When we connected up Discord, the only option was to disable all history in the channel, which is unfriendly to newcomers, and a papercut (at best) inconvenience even to existing community members using Discord.

Use-case for "random":

'''We need a channel that:'''
* allows people to have an environment where they can chat (important for community building), 
* has at least some history so the context of discussions are preserved, and; 
* is not confusing to newcomers.

<nowiki>#indieweb-random</nowiki> is proposed for this, as a new channel, without having to figure out "what to do with #indieweb-chat" since many folks are already familiar with the Slack default #random channel.

This solves the declared problem sooner without having to figure out what to do with legacy usage.

Additional details:
* indieweb-random is NOT available via the chat.indieweb.org web UI
* indieweb-random is NOT logged in our web-based chat archives
* indieweb-random is bridged to Slack and Discord, so history will be visible in both
* it is ok to quote from random even though it is not publicly archived (different from existing "-chat", and any offtopic/OTR proposal)

Opinions?
* +1 {{t}}: (proposer)
* +1 {{capjamesg}}
* +1 {{aaronpk}}
* +1 {{pcarrier}}
* +0 {{gRegor}} not opposed, but I do think this effectively means we would need to close indieweb-chat in the near future (which could also be ok!), because if we want to have unified discussions anyone across Slack, Discord, and IRC can access, only this new channel (with its history preserved in Discord/Slack), allows that.
* +1/0/-1 {{addyourself}} and optionally a comment if you wish

===== Resolution =====
The #indieweb-random channel was added on 2024-05-24.

=== Avoid General Technology Rants ===
{{note|This is a proposed subsection for this page (maybe inside [[#FAQ]]?), with perhaps a forward link from the top of [[#Chat_Channels_Purposes]], to help guide folks to avoiding (self-moderating) a mild chat anti-pattern that's popped up from time to time, and provide a convenient place to link folks rather than have to explain it every time.}}

The IndieWeb community chat has an overall positive and constructive culture, in particular on topics directly relating to the independent web and empowering each other, and we’d like to keep it that way.

Technology media (and [[social media]] in general) tend to be dominated by negative articles and posts.

This guideline is a request to avoid general technology-related rants in our on-topic channels. Typically we have seen this sort of thing about whatever technology topic is attracting the most hype, currently generative AI (e.g. [[LLM]]s) or BigTech in general, and previously topics like “[[metaverse]]”, [[cryptocurrency]], and [[blockchain]].

Lots about technology and its impact on society can be frustrating, and there’s obviously a lot of sympathy for that in the community because we are trying to make a better web, using our own websites as exemplars.

Instead of our on-topic channels, a better outlet for technology rants (if you feel compelled to share or vent or find others who feel similarly) about such topics is the [[discuss#random|#random channel]], or even better write up a thoughtful critique on your own blog!

We have a very constructively focused community, so another approach is to reconsider any general technology rant in terms of questions like:
* How does this affect my personal experience on the web, and how would I like it to be instead?
* How can I use my personal site as an alternative (or solution!) to such technological problems?
* What could I create to help solve such a technological problem?

If you discover other ways or reframing rants into constructive thoughts and words, please share!
