'''<dfn>deplatforming</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>no platform</dfn>''' is a form of banning in which a person or organization is denied the use of a platform (physical or increasingly virtual) on which to speak. 

In addition to the banning of those with socially unacceptable viewpoints, there has been a long history of marginalized voices (particularly trans, LGBTQ, sex workers, etc.) being deplatformed in systematic ways.

The banning can be from any of a variety of spaces ranging from physical meeting spaces or lectures, journalistic coverage in newspapers or television to domain name registration, [[web hosting]], and even from specific social media platforms like [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]]. Some have used these terms as narrowly as in relation to having their [[verified#Twitter|Twitter "verified" status]] removed.

“We need to puncture this myth that [deplatforming]'s only affecting far-right people.

The reason we’re talking about far-right people is that they have coverage on Fox News and representatives in Congress holding hearings. They already have political power.”

<blockquote>Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors. We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh. Gab will continue to fight for the fundamental human right to speak freely. 

As we transition to a new hosting provider Gab will be inaccessible for a period of time. We are working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. Thank you and remember to speak freely.</blockquote>
