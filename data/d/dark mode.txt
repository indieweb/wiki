'''<dfn>dark mode</dfn>''' is a feature of websites and apps that change the color scheme to be easier to read at night or in low light settings.

You should support Dark Mode on your website so when readers choose to use Dark Mode in their OS or browser, your website restyles accordingly and handles images and other resources better than any default color transformations would.

* add more reasons
