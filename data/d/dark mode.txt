'''<dfn>dark mode</dfn>''' is a feature of websites and apps that change the color scheme to be easier to read at night or in low light settings.

== Why ==

You should support Dark Mode on your website so when readers choose to use Dark Mode in their OS or browser, your website restyles accordingly and handles images and other resources better than any default color transformations would.

A few more reasons why you might want to add a dark mode include:

* dark mode can be less intense on one’s eyes, thus providing a better UX to those who struggle with bright colors on screen.
* add more reasons
