'''<dfn>[https://github.com/progrium/dokku Dokku]</dfn>''' is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service PaaS] implementation similar to [https://heroku.com Heroku] that you can run on your own site.

Like Heroku, Dokku deploys web applications from a [[git]] repository. Dokku has implemented many features found in Heroku. Switching over from Heroku to Dokku, once Dokku is installed, might be fairly easy for most applications.

Dokku does not support multiple users. This may not be a big issue for the IndieWeb, however if multiple users are required, perhaps [https://openshift.github.io OpenShift Origin] or [https://flynn.io Flynn] could be better suited to the task.

== Dokku Deployment Options ==
Some options to deploy Dokku itself:
* Dokku is easy to [https://github.com/progrium/dokku#requirements install] on [https://ubuntu.com Ubuntu]. 
* [https://digitalocean.com DigitalOcean] provides a [https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/ One Click App] with Dokku.
* [https://linode.com Linode] has a [https://www.linode.com/stackscripts/view/8552 Dokku StackScript].

== Examples ==

* {{JackyAlcine}} uses it to run [[Koype Hub]], [[Fortress]] and his copy of [[Koype]].
