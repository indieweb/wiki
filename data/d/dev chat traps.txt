{{stub}}

'''<dfn>dev chat traps</dfn>''' are technical topics, questions, debates that are brought up once in a while in the IndieWeb [[discuss]]ion channels, usually the "dev" channel, that consume quite a bit of time without any productive or actionable results, and have the impact of displacing otherwise useful conversations.

== How to not ==
Please avoid starting dev chat traps discussions, and if someone asks about a dev chat trap topic, please refer them to this page and politely request that they take the conversation somewhere better for random topics like the informal "chat" channel.

== Examples ==
* [[HTTPRange-14]]
* SSL client certs, especially as a method for server [[login]], or [[server]] to server [[authentication]]

== See Also ==
* [[discuss]]
* [[code of conduct]]
* [[dragons]]
