__TOC__
'''<dfn>dweb</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for [[distributed]] web or [[decentralized]] web, an umbrella term for a broad variety of approaches & communities working on distributed & decentralized solutions for the web & internet in general, the [[IndieWeb]] specifically, as well as a prefix for the [[DWeb Summit]] conference (and #dwebsummit hashtag) which has had IndieWeb sessions.

=== Vulnerable to abuse ===
The term "dweb" and expansions "decentralized web" or "distributed web" are all plumbing-centric (as opposed to user/human-centric) and are thus more vulnerable to abuse, distortion, squatting by amoral or unethical projects, or outright conmen or conspiracies.

** "I have repeatedly expressed to peers working on #IndieWeb #SocialWeb #SocialMedia #FederatedSocialWeb that tech/plumbing-centric framing of #dweb "Decentralized Web" "Distributed Web" is heavily problematic. Beyond MastoGab, there is now something much worse (not linking). I’ll follow up with a longer blog post (it’s been in my drafts for a while), explaining why, how we got here, and maybe some ways for how can we replace use of "Decentralized Web" or "Distributed Web" with something human-centric instead.<br><br>For a start, re-read Mozilla’s Manifesto and Principles:<br><br>https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" [https://tantek.com/ @Tantek Çelik] December 19, 2019
