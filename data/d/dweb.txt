'''<dfn>dweb</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for [[distributed]] web or [[decentralized]] web, an umbrella term for a broad variety of approaches & communities working on distributed & decentralized solutions for the web & internet in general, the [[IndieWeb]] specifically, as well as a prefix for the [[DWeb Summit]] conference (and #dwebsummit hashtag) which has had IndieWeb sessions.

=== Vulnerable to abuse ===
The term "dweb" and expansions "decentralized web" or "distributed web" are all plumbing-centric (as opposed to user/human-centric) and are thus more vulnerable to abuse, distortion, squatting by amoral or unethical projects, or outright conmen or conspiracies.
