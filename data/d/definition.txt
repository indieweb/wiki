A '''<dfn>definition</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb wiki should be an accessible, basic, clear, plain English description of the term (or phrase) naming a wiki page, with an explicit connection to the term’s relevance to the IndieWeb, and ideally without any use of [[jargon]].

If you’re looking for how to define terms used in a blog post or on a site, see:
* '''[[glossary]]'''

Good page definitions are a key part of [[wikifying]]. Help make the IndieWeb wiki a friendly glossary of terms, accessible to anyone, and improve & create pages accordingly.

== How to ==
=== Be specific ===
Be specific and meaningful in definitions, certainly more than just a link and/or restatement using the same or similar terms.

=== Definitions include IndieWeb relevance ===
When defining a term, include why it is specifically relevant to the IndieWeb (if that's not obvious from the description), beyond just a "normal" definition that could have come from Wikipedia (no need to replicate or summarize Wikipedia here, and do not copy from Wikipedia, instead link to it).

=== Tweetable definitions ===
Write definitions that are Tweetable, as there is evidence that people will tweet good definitions that are of tweetable length (including a subsequent link to the page) - that's 257 characters (space + 23 characters for the tco'd link).

** Note that he edited the dfn of [[site-deaths]] (as of that time) and removed "their" in order to make it fit on [[Twitter]].

== Markup ==
Use the [[dfn]] element around the term being defined, and MediaWiki bolding, e.g.
* <code><nowiki>A '''<dfn>definition</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb wiki…</nowiki></code>

== How not to ==
Things to avoid in definitions:
* repeating words from the term
* generic abstract definitions (the IndieWeb is not Wikipedia)
* [[jargon]]
** If absolutely necessary (e.g. many technical terms make sense only in terms of other technical terms), use as few jargon terms as possible, and then link/define them too.
