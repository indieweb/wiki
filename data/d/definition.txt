A '''<dfn>definition</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb wiki should be an accessible, basic, clear, plain English description of the term (or phrase) naming a wiki page, with an explicit connection to the term’s relevance to the IndieWeb, and ideally without any use of [[jargon]].

If you’re looking for how to define terms used in a blog post or on a site, see:
* '''[[glossary]]'''

Good page definitions are a key part of [[wikifying]]. Help make the IndieWeb wiki a friendly glossary of terms, accessible to anyone, and improve & create pages accordingly.

== How to ==
=== Be specific ===
Be specific and meaningful in definitions, certainly more than just a link and/or restatement using the same or similar terms.

=== Definitions include IndieWeb relevance ===
When defining a term, include why it is specifically relevant to the IndieWeb (if that's not obvious from the description), beyond just a "normal" definition that could have come from Wikipedia.

=== Do not copy from Wikipedia ===
Please do not copy definitions from Wikipedia, or even just restate the same thing as Wikipedia, or only have a definition that links to Wikipedia.

Any of those likely indicate that the page does not belong on the IndieWeb wiki, and it may be deleted.

=== Do not copy from LLM generated text ===
Please do not use tools like ChatGPT to write a definition for the IndieWeb wiki.

Such LLM produced definitions are usually generic, not related to the IndieWeb, and of questionable validity.

=== Tweetable definitions ===
Write definitions that are Tweetable, as there is evidence that people will tweet good definitions that are of tweetable length (including a subsequent link to the page) - that's 257 characters (space + 23 characters for the tco'd link).

** Note that he edited the dfn of [[site-deaths]] (as of that time) and removed "their" in order to make it fit on [[Twitter]].

=== How to markup ===
Use the [[dfn]] element around the term being defined, and MediaWiki bolding, e.g.
* <code><nowiki>A '''<dfn>definition</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb wiki…</nowiki></code>

== How not to ==
Things to avoid in definitions:
* repeating words from the term
* generic abstract definitions (the IndieWeb is not Wikipedia)
* [[jargon]]
** If absolutely necessary (e.g. many technical terms make sense only in terms of other technical terms), use as few jargon terms as possible, and then link/define them too.

== See Also ==
* [[wikifying]]
* [[dfn]]
* to do: figure out a split between the page about definitions on the IndieWeb wiki itself, and definition [[posts]] or [[page]]s, e.g.:
** definition post: https://tantek.com/2015/228/t3/bim-definition <blockquote>"bim definition<br> noun; plural: bims<br>1. each of six newcal periods into which a year is divided.<br>2. 61 days, except for the last 60 days of a non-leap-year.<br><br>Etymology: short for bi-month or bimonth, from bi- ("two") + month.<br> <br>See also: newcal.org/#bimdefinition" <cite style="display:block;text-align:right">[https://tantek.com/ @Tantek Çelik] August 16, 2015</cite></blockquote>
** definition page: http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/highpass.html
** current thought: indieweb wiki related move to -> [[indieweb-definition]], delete redirect, create new [[definition]] page for definition posts & pages.
* [[dfn]]
* If there is both an IndieWeb usage/practice relating to a term, even if only one or a few people, and also a silo usage/practice relating to a term, prefer and use the IndieWeb usage/practice to define the term, and only secondarily (like in another sentence) document the silo usage of the term.
