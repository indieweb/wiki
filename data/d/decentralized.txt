'''<dfn>decentralized</dfn>''' is a term that attempts to refer to a network topology freed of a central authority. The network can be any connected group of agents: computers, people, governments. It is often misunderstood and misapplied.

== Real World Misuse ==

The term is often used by [[monoculture]] social network (web or other) projects to describe themselves, thus by consistently failing, have the unintended consequence of teaching the market to expect anything labeled decentralized to fail.

== Academic Definition ==

Rohit Khare wrote in ''2.3.4 Decentralized'' of [https://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit/Khare-Thesis-FINAL.pdf Extending the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Architectural Style for Decentralized Systems] (2003):

<blockquote>Decentralization is fundamentally different from either centralization or distribution because it permits multiple, distinct, simultaneously valid outcomes for the same decision. It also differs significantly from estimation, since several independent agents with their own estimates of a centralized or distributed variable can end up using multiple, distinct values at the same time, they are all attempting to recover a single outcome for the shared decision. In a consensus-free system, each agency’s updates merely represent its own opinion — and comparing more opinions from other, trusted agencies can increase the accuracy of one’s own opinion. The statistical premise behind this is that the errors of each agency are independent: they can’t ''all'' conspire against you. Thus, a hallmark of decentralization is its specific emphasis on agency conflicts — a shift from matters of ''fact'' to matters of ''opinion''.</blockquote>

=== Paraphrase ===

In a fully decentralized topology there is no one, true canonical definition of a concept. It is up to the individual node to determine what is and what is not "true".

=== Example Chat Topologies ===

 INDIEWEB = //indieweb.org
 OFFICIAL_CHAT = //chat.indieweb.org/indieweb
 ALICE_CHAT = //alice.example/chat/indieweb
 BOB_CHAT = //bob.example/chat/indieweb

==== Centralized ====

Alice signs in to <code>INDIEWEB</code> and posts a message to <code>OFFICIAL_CHAT</code>. Copies can be backfed to her own site <code>ALICE_CHAT</code>.

==== Distributed ====

<code>OFFICIAL_CHAT</code> is the canonical resource for the "IndieWeb primary chat channel". Alice may reference this resource on her own <code>ALICE_CHAT</code> using <code>rel=canonical</code>. This would imply that her channel is a non-canonical alternate for the ''true'' IndieWeb's version. She posts to her own site <code>ALICE_CHAT</code>, publishes them to <code>OFFICIAL_CHAT</code> and from there her message is relayed to all other participants, all of whom respect the message as true and correct (author, content, timestamp). Bob renders Alice's message on his own <code>BOB_CHAT</code>.

==== Estimated ====

Take the distributed example above but instead of relaying through <code>OFFICIAL_CHAT</code> Alice delivers the message directly to each participant directly. Bob checks <code>OFFICIAL_CHAT</code> to see if <code>ALICE_CHAT</code> is listed before accepting and rendering her message on his own chat <code>BOB_CHAT</code> (80% certainty). If this is the first time Bob sees Alice he may grey her text for the first hour until she's proven a trustworthy participant (95% certainty).

Note that in this public case a fair estimation can be made easily and the risks of failure are low. Consider alternatively a private chat where you risk revealing sensitive information with Alice before fully trusting her.

==== Decentralized ====

In this case you can remove <code>OFFICIAL_CHAT</code> completely. Alice posts to her own site <code>ALICE_CHAT</code>. Bob joins the channel by posting to his own site <code>BOB_CHAT</code> and publishing to Alice directly. It is entirely up to Alice to determine if Bob is a trusted participant of the channel. If she decides that Bob is ''not'' to be trusted, she can squelch his publishes. When Carol joins she chooses who to trust.

Note that Tina from the IndieWeb can share trust information on new participants allowing for some degree of centralized trust in an otherwise decentralized topology.

Note that it is a certainty that a chat channel with tens, let alone thousands or millions, of participants will diverge over time as a consequence.
