{{stub}}

'''<dfn>data portability</dfn>''' is the ability for the user of a device, service, or site to move their data (anything they author or incidentally create like location tracking) to another device, service, or site (like their indie web site) of their choosing, preferably in an open standard format.

== Formats ==
On the indieweb, the most supported formats are those which are published on sites and actively interoperate across sites using well established protocols such as [[Webmention]]. In that regard, the following formats are widely supported for providing and consuming data, and are thus best suited for exports of data for data portability:

* [[h-feed]] - for a collection of the user's posts, reactions, even activities.
* [[h-entry]] - for information specific to a particular post or page from the user
* [[h-card]] - for information about the user, the author or creator of any particular post or piece of data

Additional formats to consider for specific types of data. Some sites may allow creation of special kinds of posts or other types of content. Some of these may be served by specific formats for those purposes better than h-entry:
* [[h-event]] - for events created by users
* [[h-recipe]] - for recipes

== Silo Examples ==
Below is a list of sites that meet the following criteria:

# they let you publish things on the web
# they let you retrieve '''all''' the content that you have posted in a reasonably user friendly way (with third party tools, if necessary)

(Note: being able to backup your data from these services means you can transition to running your own site. [[posse]] is a better way as the canonical version remains on your site and syndicate to the other services.)
