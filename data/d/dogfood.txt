'''<dfn>dogfood</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb, refers to the software practice of "eating your own dog food" but in particular with using <em>your own [[creator|creations]]</em> on your own <em>personal site</em> that you <em>depend</em> on, day to day.

[[selfdogfooding]] in particular is one of several indieweb [[principles]].

Since [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food colloquial usage] is a bit broader and (mis)biased toward a "a <em>company</em> <nowiki>[using]</nowiki> its own product", thereby implying people using <em>work</em> creations on <em>work</em> sites (rather than their own individual/personal sites), and not necessarily depending on them,  it's helpful to have a more specific, more meaningful term to use in broader contexts:

* [[selfdogfood]]
