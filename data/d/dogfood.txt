'''<dfn>dogfood</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb, refers to the software practice of "eating your own dog food" but in particular with using <em>your own [[creator|creations]]</em> on your own <em>personal site</em> that you <em>depend</em> on, day to day. Beginning in 2019, the community began actively eschewing the words dogfood and [[selfdogfood]]ing  for the more positive framing of the phrase "[[eat what you cook]]".

[[eat what you cook|Eating what you cook]] in particular is one of several IndieWeb [[principles]].

Since [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food colloquial usage] is a bit broader and (mis)biased toward a "a <em>company</em> <nowiki>[using]</nowiki> its own product", thereby implying people using <em>work</em> creations on <em>work</em> sites (rather than their own individual/personal sites), and not necessarily depending on them,  it's helpful to have a more specific, more meaningful term to use in broader contexts:

* [[selfdogfood]]

== Criticism ==
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#Criticisms_and_support for starters.

=== Negative gender and cultural associations ===
Self-associating with "dog" is possibly particularly negatively gendered and offensive in some cultures.
