'''<dfn>[https://splot.ca/ SPLOT]</dfn>''' is a single purpose web site that allows anonymous or public publishing without requiring registration or signing in to contribute (participants choose how much/little to identify themselves). It defies rigid definitions, and may or may not stand for Smallest/Simplest * Possible/Portable * Open/Online * Learning/Living *  Tool/Technology.

Most SPLOTs so far are Wordpress child themes; if they use plugins, free ones. Each comes with theme options interface for tailoring sites; makes use of built in post/category/tags features. [https://github.com/cogdog/permutator One GitHub SPLOT] exists. See also a collection of more variants at [c splot.tools].

Most SPLOTs are designed with two core principles in mind:
* make it as easy as possible to post activity to the open web in an appealing and accessible way
* allow users to do so without creating accounts, or providing any required personal information
