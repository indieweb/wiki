<blockquote>
Some Substack newsletters by Nazis and white nationalists have thousands or tens of thousands of subscribers, making the platform a new and valuable tool for creating mailing lists for the far right. And many accept paid subscriptions through Substack, seemingly flouting terms of service that ban attempts to ‚Äúpublish content or fund initiatives that incite violence based on protected classes.‚Äù
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Substack, which takes a 10 percent cut of subscription revenue, makes money when readers pay for Nazi newsletters.

<blockquote>
‚ÄúSo Substack has an editorial policy, but no accountability. And they have terms of service, but no enforcement. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the usual Silicon Valley sleight-of-hand move, very similar to Uber reps claiming drivers aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcore‚Äù to their business.‚Äù
</blockquote>

=== Many trackers by default ===

** "Ironically, quite a few google and optimizely trackers on your blog. Likely unintentional as they're quite difficult to avoid using any commercial service but if substack isn't paying you, consider moving elsewhere? And if they are, maybe a post explaining what's being collected." [https://twitter.com/jakobsohn @jakobsohn] June 15, 2021

=== Notes feature appears unmoderated ===
Substack‚Äôs new ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù feature and moderation challenges/neglect (CW racism or support thereof)

=== May not last ===
Will it last? Thread: https://xoxo.zone/@mathowie/111020301146427089
<blockquote>"I hate it when you follow a link to a really great blog post and you're two paragraphs in thinking oh my god this is really good but then a modal popup window from substack asks you to subscribe to this newsletter and you have to hit "continue reading" to finish and then you wonder if this great blog entry will last on someone else's service that may not be around in a few years"</blockquote> <cite>[https://xoxo.zone/@mathowie @mathowie] September 6, 2023</cite>

}}<blockquote>I‚Äôve also been kind of reluctant to let so much of my content live somewhere other than on my website. It doesn‚Äôt matter that Substack is a great platform, and that I can move my content off it whenever I want. It doesn‚Äôt matter that I can monetize my content here. It‚Äôs still ''not my platform'', and I have no control over the rollout of new features, visual changes, monetization policies, etc. Some people have complained to me that I‚Äôm being too pushy trying to get them to pay for a subscription. Well, it‚Äôs not me doing the pushing, it‚Äôs Substack. It‚Äôs all automated and beyond my control. And ultimately, what matters the most to me in my business in control and autonomy.</blockquote>

}}<blockquote>You, as a community, space, or platform are deciding who and what is unacceptable. In Substack‚Äôs case, for example, they don‚Äôt allow pornography but they do allow Nazis. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù but rather a business decision. If you‚Äôre making moderation based on financials, fine, but say so. Then platform users can make choices appropriately.</blockquote>

Honestly, it‚Äôs my bad for using Substack in the first place. I‚Äôd already left the platform once before, back in 2021, when it launched an initiative to pay a lot of well-known writers to use its product ‚Äì many of whose whole schtick was fomenting anti-trans hate.</blockquote>

}}<blockquote>Instead of trying to comb through the multitude of blogging platforms and newsletter providers out there, I have instead decided that I will be a platform of one. This way, I don't have to worry that a platform will ‚Äî as with Substack ‚Äî fail to enforce content moderation policies that I thought should have protected against this. It also gives me a lot more ownership and control over the work that I do, which is something I've been wanting for a while.</blockquote>
