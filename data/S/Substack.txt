=== Lack of accountability ===
* “So Substack has an editorial policy, but no accountability. And they have terms of service, but no enforcement. … It’s the usual Silicon Valley sleight-of-hand move, very similar to Uber reps claiming drivers aren’t “core” to their business.” https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so
=== Many trackers by default ===

** "Ironically, quite a few google and optimizely trackers on your blog. Likely unintentional as they're quite difficult to avoid using any commercial service but if substack isn't paying you, consider moving elsewhere? And if they are, maybe a post explaining what's being collected." [https://twitter.com/jakobsohn @jakobsohn] June 15, 2021
