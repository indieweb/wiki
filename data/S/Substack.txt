=== Lack of accountability ===
* ‚ÄúSo Substack has an editorial policy, but no accountability. And they have terms of service, but no enforcement. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the usual Silicon Valley sleight-of-hand move, very similar to Uber reps claiming drivers aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcore‚Äù to their business.‚Äù https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so
=== Many trackers by default ===

** "Ironically, quite a few google and optimizely trackers on your blog. Likely unintentional as they're quite difficult to avoid using any commercial service but if substack isn't paying you, consider moving elsewhere? And if they are, maybe a post explaining what's being collected." [https://twitter.com/jakobsohn @jakobsohn] June 15, 2021

}}<blockquote>I‚Äôve also been kind of reluctant to let so much of my content live somewhere other than on my website. It doesn‚Äôt matter that Substack is a great platform, and that I can move my content off it whenever I want. It doesn‚Äôt matter that I can monetize my content here. It‚Äôs still ''not my platform'', and I have no control over the rollout of new features, visual changes, monetization policies, etc. Some people have complained to me that I‚Äôm being too pushy trying to get them to pay for a subscription. Well, it‚Äôs not me doing the pushing, it‚Äôs Substack. It‚Äôs all automated and beyond my control. And ultimately, what matters the most to me in my business in control and autonomy.</blockquote>

** "I hate it when you follow a link to a really great blog post and you're two paragraphs in thinking oh my god this is really good but then a modal popup window from substack asks you to subscribe to this newsletter and you have to hit "continue reading" to finish and then you wonder if this great blog entry will last on someone else's service that may not be around in a few years" [https://xoxo.zone/@mathowie @mathowie] September 6, 2023

** "I love that newsletters are getting people writing freely again, but there's so much great writing trapped behind the walls of substack and their shady CEO, I'd warn a friend if they were pouring their heart into say, Pinterest boards, that there are better more permanent places to host your stuff for the long term!"
