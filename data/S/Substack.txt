<blockquote>
Some Substack newsletters by Nazis and white nationalists have thousands or tens of thousands of subscribers, making the platform a new and valuable tool for creating mailing lists for the far right. And many accept paid subscriptions through Substack, seemingly flouting terms of service that ban attempts to “publish content or fund initiatives that incite violence based on protected classes.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Substack, which takes a 10 percent cut of subscription revenue, makes money when readers pay for Nazi newsletters.

<blockquote>
“So Substack has an editorial policy, but no accountability. And they have terms of service, but no enforcement. … It’s the usual Silicon Valley sleight-of-hand move, very similar to Uber reps claiming drivers aren’t “core” to their business.”
</blockquote>

=== Many trackers by default ===

** "Ironically, quite a few google and optimizely trackers on your blog. Likely unintentional as they're quite difficult to avoid using any commercial service but if substack isn't paying you, consider moving elsewhere? And if they are, maybe a post explaining what's being collected." [https://twitter.com/jakobsohn @jakobsohn] June 15, 2021

}}<blockquote>I’ve also been kind of reluctant to let so much of my content live somewhere other than on my website. It doesn’t matter that Substack is a great platform, and that I can move my content off it whenever I want. It doesn’t matter that I can monetize my content here. It’s still ''not my platform'', and I have no control over the rollout of new features, visual changes, monetization policies, etc. Some people have complained to me that I’m being too pushy trying to get them to pay for a subscription. Well, it’s not me doing the pushing, it’s Substack. It’s all automated and beyond my control. And ultimately, what matters the most to me in my business in control and autonomy.</blockquote>

}}<blockquote>You, as a community, space, or platform are deciding who and what is unacceptable. In Substack’s case, for example, they don’t allow pornography but they do allow Nazis. That’s not “free speech” but rather a business decision. If you’re making moderation based on financials, fine, but say so. Then platform users can make choices appropriately.</blockquote>

}}<blockquote>That is to say, by subscribing to Second Breakfast, you are no longer supporting a platform that has, quite openly, come out in support of Nazis using and profiting from its site. Honestly, it’s my bad for using Substack in the first place. I’d already left the platform once before, back in 2021, when it launched an initiative to pay a lot of well-known writers to use its product – many of whose whole schtick was fomenting anti-trans hate.</blockquote>

}}<blockquote>I have inconvenienced myself with my tech principles for decades at this point. It takes days for my local bookshops to send me books because I try very hard to not use Amazon. I am not a part of several family and friend What’sApp groups because I loathe anything Facebook is or touches. I have, for decades, tried to live up to my values, fought for the open web and made technology choices that align with who I am and what I believe in.</blockquote>
