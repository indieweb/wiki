{{stub}}
'''<dfn>[http://sass-lang.com/ Sass]</dfn>''' is a Stylesheet Language that extends [[CSS]] and is compiled into CSS before publishing. 
It describes itself as "CSS with superpowers".

Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance. 

== Partials ==

Partials are Sass files that contain pieces of CSS code that you can include in other Sass files. This allows for modularity and improve maintenance.
