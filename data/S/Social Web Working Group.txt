The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/wiki/socialwg Social Web Working Group]</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Social Web WG</dfn> or <dfn>Social WG</dfn>) was a [[W3C]] Working Group that was chartered with developing specifications (including IndieWeb specifications) for the [[social web]], based on the outcome of the [[osfw3c]] workshop in 2013-08. It was active from 2014-07-21 to 2018-02-13, some work has continued in the Social Web Community Group, and all IndieWeb related specifications continue to be developed in the IndieWeb community.

== Social WG IRC ==
The Social Web WG used the #social IRC channel on the W3C IRC network (irc.w3.org). It's the best place to catch up on discussions and meeting (telcon, face-to-face) interactions:

== History ==
(this section is a stub)

The Social Web Working Group had to evaluate numerous different approaches (rough estimates are about 15 or so) that were proposed by members of the group as work items before narrowing down to ~2.5 approaches.

Some evidence of the different approaches/technologies/projects that were proposed are the SocialWG wiki, e.g.:
