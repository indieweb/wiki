The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/wiki/socialwg Social Web Working Group]</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Social Web WG</dfn> or <dfn>Social WG</dfn>) was a [[W3C]] Working Group that was chartered with developing specifications (including IndieWeb specifications) for the [[social web]], based on the outcome of the [[osfw3c]] workshop in 2013-08. It was active from 2014-07-21 to 2018-02-13, some work has continued in the Social Web Community Group, and all IndieWeb related specifications continue to be developed in the IndieWeb community.

== Specifications ==
Now maintained by the IndieWeb community, see https://spec.indieweb.org/
* [[Webmention]]
* [[Micropub]]
* [[WebSub]]
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[JF2]]
* [[Post Type Discovery]]

Most of the remainder of the specs are maintained by the Social CG:
* [[ActivityStreams]]
* [[ActivityPub]]

And one is maintained by https://linkedresearch.org/
* [[LDN]]

== Social CG ==
The Social Web Community Group (Social CG) took over maintenance of some of the specifications from the Social Web WG.

Currently there are no regular meetings, though the Social CG uses the #social channel on the W3C IRC network (irc.w3.org).

== Social WG CG IRC ==
The Social Web WG used (and now the Social Web CG uses) the #social IRC channel on the W3C IRC network (irc.w3.org).

== History ==
(this section is a stub)

The Social Web Working Group had to evaluate numerous different approaches (rough estimates are about 15 or so) that were proposed by members of the group as work items before narrowing down to ~2.5 approaches.

Some evidence of the different approaches/technologies/projects that were proposed are the SocialWG wiki, e.g.:
