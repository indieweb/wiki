The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/wiki/socialwg Social Web Working Group]</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Social Web WG</dfn> or <dfn>Social WG</dfn>) was a [[W3C]] Working Group from 2014-2018 that was chartered with developing specifications (including IndieWeb specifications) for the [[social web]], based on the outcome of the 2013 [[osfw3c]] workshop. Since its closure, some Social WG work was continued in the Social Web Community Group (SWICG), and all IndieWeb related specifications are actively developed in the IndieWeb community.

== Specifications ==
Now maintained by the IndieWeb community, see https://spec.indieweb.org/
* [[Webmention]]
* [[Micropub]]
* [[WebSub]]
* [[IndieAuth]]
* [[JF2]]
* [[Post Type Discovery]]

Most of the remainder of the specs are maintained by the Social CG:
* [[Activity Streams 2.0]]
* [[Activity Vocabulary]]
* [[ActivityPub]]

And one is maintained by https://linkedresearch.org/
* [[LDN]]

== Social CG ==
The Social Web Community Group (Social CG / SWICG) took over maintenance of some of the specifications from the Social Web WG.

Currently there are no regular meetings, though the Social CG uses the #social channel on the W3C IRC network (irc.w3.org).

== Social WG CG IRC ==
The Social Web WG used (and now the Social Web CG uses) the #social IRC channel on the W3C IRC network (irc.w3.org).

== History ==
(this section is a stub)

* 2013-08-07â€¦08 [[osfw3c]] workshop
* 2014-07-21 to 2018-02-13 Social Web Working Group duration

The Social Web Working Group had to evaluate numerous prior group efforts (17+) & different approaches (~15) that were proposed by members of the group for consideration before narrowing down to ~2.5 approaches all of which used HTTP & [[link rel]] discovery, and then had differences which could be summarized as:
* [[HTML]](+JSON) Web-based: [[Webmention]], [[microformats2]], [[Micropub]], [[IndieAuth]], [[Post Type Discovery]]
* [[JSON]]<span title="optional Linked Data usage, not required, nor supported in vast majority of implementations">(-LD)<span> API-based: [[Activity Streams 2.0]], [[ActivityPub]]
* [[LD]] [[Semantic Web]] based: [[LDN]], the "0.5" that eventually became a building block for [[Solid]], developed outside the WG.

Some evidence of the numerous approaches/technologies/projects that were proposed are on the SocialWG wiki, e.g.:
* Various groups: https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg#All_Social_Web_Related_CGs
* Various technical approaches: https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/Candidates
