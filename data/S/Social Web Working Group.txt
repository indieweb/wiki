The '''<dfn>[https://www.w3.org/wiki/socialwg Social Web Working Group]</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>Social Web WG</dfn> or <dfn>Social WG</dfn>) was a [[W3C]] Working Group that was chartered with developing specifications for the [[social web]], based on the outcome of the [[osfw3c]] workshop in 2013-08. It was active from 2014-07-21 to 2018-02-13, and some work has continued in the Social Web Community Group since then.
