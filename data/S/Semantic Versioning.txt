'''<dfn>[https://semver.org/ Semantic Versioning]</dfn>''' ('''semver''') is a method to build a meaningful version number. Each digit conveys meaning about the state of the underlying code. It's sometimes referred to as ''MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format''.

<blockquote cite="https://semver.org/">Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

# MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
# MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
# PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
