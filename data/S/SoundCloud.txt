'''<dfn>[http://soundcloud.com/ SoundCloud]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] for hosting/sharing/commenting on sounds and music.

It allows embedding of hosted content through the use of iframes.

== IndieWeb uses ==
* acegiak.net embeds songs created by others that are on SoundCloud as a way of linking to the content without claiming ownership.

* [[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] posts audio to SoundCloud and embeds it on waterpigs.co.uk, e.g. http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4VZBsx/

=== Screening and termination by BigContent ===

=== Flash still required on desktop ===
Despite having an HTML5 version of the player, the desktop version still requires [[Flash]] in order to play audio. You can apparently get around this with [[User Agent]] spoofing: [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-11-09#t1447106444762]

=== Commentary lock-in ===

When the SoundCloud player is embedded in other posts on other Silos or the web, all comments / likes / etc. are not shown. All the community building effort is locked-in to the SoundCloud site itself. A way to export / relay all commentary for a given track or playlist into Indieweb would be highly desirable. This is important data being produced by individuals that represents valuable information about a given track, and there is currently no way to share this on the open web other than copy and pasting all the text from soundcloud.com, with very poor formatting. A [[bridgy]] feature request was filed: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/587

=== Speculative Shutdown ===
* 2017-07-12 '''[[Soundcloud]]''' [https://blog.soundcloud.com/2017/07/06/note-alex-ljung/ laid off 40% of its staff last week] and [https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/soundshroud/ some speculation] indicates it may not last. At present, Soundcloud doesn't have a bulk export feature.
* 2017-08-11 Billboard [https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/7898079/soundcloud-accepts-170-million-rescue-taps-new-ceo-to reports on a $170 million infusion]. With this founder Alex Ljung will step down as CEO, letting Kerry Trainor (former [[Vimeo]] CEO) take over.

== How to ==

=== How to export your data ===
Soundcloud doesn't have a bulk export feature, but some of the following potential methods exist to export content.
* Manual method within Soundcloud: Account holders can make all your tracks private, then make them downloadable, and then download them individually. Pro subscription users should be able to do this one at a time.[https://soundcloudcommunity.com/soundcloud-on-your-computer-230066/how-to-export-my-content-6831150] 
<blockquote>...start on your [https://soundcloud.com/you/tracks track page] in order to narrow down the number of clicks you need to make. I see you're on a Pro plan, so you don't necessarily need to enable downloads for your tracks and change the privacy settings, but can go to your tracks' edit mode and download the original from there.</blockquote>
* For those on [[WordPress]], Blubrry offers an export path that maintains metadata as well as content. For instructions, see [https://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/advanced-tools-and-options/import-podcast-soundcloud/ this article].

* The [[Huffduffer]] bookmarklet can be used to process files for potential download. Note that this may take a good bit of time and manual labor and isn't recommended for accounts with large numbers of files.
