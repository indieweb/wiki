'''<dfn>Solid</dfn>''' is a decentralized file system and protocol designed to power decentralized social applications and linked data.  It primarily leverages existing technologies - like many existing HTTP verbs - to handle a variety of identity, federation, and storage problems with the current web.

Solid was named by {{sandro}} during a W3C [[Social Web Working Group]] meeting [https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-03-18-minutes#solid as captured in the meeting minutes].
