== Criticism ==
Criticisms and warnings for visitors.

=== Surveillance Cameras ===
For those visiting for an IndieWebCamp who wish to avoid (some) known public surveillance:

* https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1093271496158371840
** "The San Francisco District Attorney maintains a map of thousands of surveillance cameras across the city. <br><br>Now, thanks to a public records request, EFF is sharing this data publicly: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/san-francisco-district-attorneys-10-most-surveilled-places" [https://www.eff.org @EFF] February 6, 2019 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DywUdRoU8AAQL3B.jpg" style="max-width:100%" alt="Map of San Francisco with small black dots where there are surveillance cameras" />

In 2019, San Francisco became the first city to ban the use of facial-recogntion technologies:

=== Property Theft ===
A bit ironic given the previous criticism.

tl;dr: Keep your laptop, ipad, phone(s) on your person at all times when out and about in the city, including with you in the passenger compartment in your car, not in the trunk. Keep any bags/purses in front of you, not draped over the back of a chair you‚Äôre sitting in. 

Property crimes (especially car breakins) are quite common unfortunately:
