== Hazards ==
Hazards and warnings for visitors.

Local tips (and warnings!) for those visiting for an IndieWebCamp: 
* 2022-02-28 SFGate: [https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/San-Francisco-rites-of-passage-16945025.php What are the rites of passage for becoming a San Franciscan? Reddit users listed them.]

=== Surveillance Cameras ===
For those visiting for an IndieWebCamp who wish to avoid (some) known public surveillance:

* https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1093271496158371840
** "The San Francisco District Attorney maintains a map of thousands of surveillance cameras across the city. <br><br>Now, thanks to a public records request, EFF is sharing this data publicly: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/san-francisco-district-attorneys-10-most-surveilled-places" [https://www.eff.org @EFF] February 6, 2019 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DywUdRoU8AAQL3B.jpg" style="max-width:100%" alt="Map of San Francisco with small black dots where there are surveillance cameras" />

In 2022, San Francisco started a 15 month trial use of police access to private security cameras:
* 2022-09-21 SFGate: [https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/san-francisco-passes-surveillance-plan-17457342.php San Francisco passes controversial surveillance plan] <blockquote>Under the new policy, police can access up to 24 hours of live video of outdoor footage from private surveillance cameras owned by individuals or businesses without a warrant as long as the camera's owner allows it. Police must meet one of three outlined criteria [‚Ä¶]</blockquote>

In 2019, San Francisco became the first city to ban the use of facial-recognition technologies:

=== Property Theft ===
A bit ironic given the previous criticism.

tl;dr: Keep your laptop, iPad, phone(s) on your person at all times when out and about in the city.
If you are in a car, keep these items with you in the passenger compartment, not in the trunk. If you are sitting at a table or parklet, keep any bags/purses in front of you, not draped over the back of a chair you‚Äôre sitting in. 

Property crimes (especially car breakins) are quite common unfortunately: 
* 2021-12-08 [https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/car-broken-into-with-family-members-toddlers-inside-near-san-franciscos-lombard-street/  Car broken into with family members, toddlers inside near San Francisco‚Äôs Lombard Street]

=== Tsunamis ===
Tsunami risk / flood zones:
