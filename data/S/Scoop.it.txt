'''<dfn>[https://www.scoop.it/ Scoop.it]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] content curation hub that also encourages [[syndication|syndicating]] to social media services, websites, and via [[newsletter]]s.


== Criticism ==
In an apparent attempt to encourage users to upgrade to paid accounts (or perhaps to remind them of their accounts and to encourage more use), Scoop.it started email users in 2020-12 that their account would expire if not confirmed every 30 days.

<blockquote>Your Scoop.it account is about to expire, confirm it for free in one click.

Please confirm your account now to keep it active and continue to enjoy Scoop.it for free. If not confirmed every 30 days, inactive accounts are deactivated.

CONFIRM MY ACCOUNT
Please click on the button above to confirm your account or copy paste this link in your browser: <nowiki>https://www.scoop.it/account-confirm/KeyIDRedacted</nowiki>

This procedure only applies to free Scoop.it accounts. Choose a premium plan if you wish to no longer confirm your account every 30 days.</blockquote>
