** "I love independent proposals, so next release of #snac will include support for Webmention. It's a protocol built on top of web standards and part of the IndieWeb. It helps web page maintainers and bloggers to know when one of their URLs are mentioned in other platforms by providing a webhook to receive notifications. In snac's case, all links written in a Fediverse post (directly or using the Markdown format) will be tested for Webmention endpoints and notified if they exist.<br><br>I don't know how many web sites out there implement Webmention (I guess very few), but given that it has been very simple to implement, here it is.<br><br>Long live the non-big-tech Internet.<br><br>#Webmention #IndieWeb" [https://comam.es/snac/grunfink @grunfink] May 4, 2025
