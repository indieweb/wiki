'''<dfn>SEO</dfn>''' is an acronym for <dfn>Search Engine Optimization</dfn> which refers to the practice and results of publishing pages and permalinks on the web in order to rank better (earlier/higher) in web [[search]] engine results. In practice IndieWeb sites seem to do better than [[silos]] at search engine results.

Anecdotal experience of what does better, in rough order:
* IndieWeb sites with permalinks with slugs of search terms
* Silos with permalinks with slugs of search terms
* IndieWeb sites with permalinks without slugs
* Other silo results

E.g. searching for "emailefail"

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Notable examples of search terms or phrases showing indieweb results first or in some other highlighted manner such as an explicit preview.

=== IndieWeb Wiki ===
The IndieWeb Wiki itself shows up frequently in top search results. Interesting examples:

"[[NASCAR problem]]" is not only the first result in Google (as of 2017-11-15), but shown in a preview box with abbreviated text from the page and a screenshot (almost like an encyclopedic presentation)
