'''<dfn>SEO</dfn>''' is an acronym for <dfn>Search Engine Optimization</dfn> which refers to the practice and results of publishing pages and permalinks on the web in order to rank better (earlier/higher) in web [[search]] engine results. In practice IndieWeb sites seem to do better than [[silos]] at search engine results.

Anecdotal experience of what does better, in rough order:
* IndieWeb sites with permalinks with slugs of search terms
* HTML over equivalent PDF content
* Silos with permalinks with slugs of search terms
* IndieWeb sites with permalinks without slugs
* Other silo results with slugs of search terms (e.g. silo wikis)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Notable examples of search terms or phrases showing indieweb results first or in some other highlighted manner such as an explicit preview.

=== Donald McIntosh ===
Donald McIntosh's journal of The French Divide beats their official [[Facebook]] page, [https://twitter.com/DonaldBMcIntosh/status/947223028416630784 as of 2017-12-30].

https://w7apk.com/baofeng beats the PDF version of the same information on another site.

=== IndieWeb Wiki ===
The IndieWeb Wiki itself shows up frequently in top search results. Interesting examples:

"[[NASCAR problem]]" is not only the first result in Google (as of 2017-11-15), but shown in a preview box with abbreviated text from the page and a screenshot (almost like an encyclopedic presentation)

=== Tantek ===

{{t}}'s Twitter account showed up for {{capjamesg}} in the top position for the query "t" on desktop and the second-from-top position for "t" on mobile on the Google search engine.

Google displayed {{t}}'s permalinks back to his original posts. This shows that your domain could show up in Twitter posts that appear on Google, which gives additional incentive to add original post permalinks to your POSSE Tweets.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Publish Good Content At Simple Permalinks ===
Some of the oldest "simple" advice on SEO for independent websites essentially recommends:
* publish well-written relevant blog posts on a topic
* use [[URL design|well designed]] permalinks with slugs mentioning key topics

If you do that, people will appreciate your blog posts, and are more likely to want to share them with others, informally (e.g. in messages), and publicly, on their own blogs or social media, which search engines will notice and use as an indicator.

Keeping your permalinks short and readable (less than 70 characters, no random hex digits / UUIDs etc.) make them easier for folks to share, and more likely that people receiving / seeing them will click on them.
