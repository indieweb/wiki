    '''<dfn>Suunto</dfn>''' is a maker of [[exercise]] watches for running and other physical activities that tracks GPS and heart rate, and can sync with a web silo at movescount.com or the Suunto mobile native app..

== How to Export ==
Suunto watches can upload data to their Movescount silo, which can auto-upload to [[Strava]], which can then export your data.

There are some apparent approaches to exporting Suunto watch data to a PC or Mac without a network connection:

== Features ==
Suunto watches collect information on exercises like running, and then store them.

This data can then be synced with:
* Suunto Movescount native mobile app
* http://www.movescount.com/ website

== Strava Upload ==
You can automatically upload Suunto data to the Strava exercise silo.

Set it up with:
* http://www.movescount.com/connect/strava

== Demand for export ==
Due to the [[Movescount#2018-02-04|over 24 hours of Movescount downtime in early 2018]], users are demanding that Suunto provide a way to directly export data from the watches (presumably without the Movescount "app"):
