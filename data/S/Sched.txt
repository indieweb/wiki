'''<dfn>[https://sched.com/ Sched]</dfn>''' is a paid [[event]]-based [[silo]] that allows attendees to easily [[RSVP]] for events on the service.

The service also allows:
*Offer attendees a casual planning tool or require them to book seats in advance. Limit capacities, offer waitlists and check them in at your event.
* Help attendees get everything they hope to get out of your event by letting them plan their schedule and explore who else is coming.

== User Interface Examples ==
The service provides the ability to display [[RSVP|RSVPs]] as a [[facepile]]
