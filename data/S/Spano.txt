{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Spano</dfn>''' is a [[micropub media endpoint]] which accepts file uploads via [[Micropub]] and returns a URL for use in a subsequent Micropub post. It is created by [[User:Martymcgui.re|Marty McGuire]].

Spano is built on the Python [[Flask]] framework and makes use of {{ kylewm }}'s [https://github.com/kylewm/flask-micropub flask-micropub] library for handling [[IndieAuth]] and finding Micropub endpoints.

Spano makes use of [[content addressing]] via [https://flask-hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Flask-HashFS] so that repeated uploads of the same file do not take extra space and always returns the same url. Additionally, revisions of files with the same name cannot overwrite one another.
