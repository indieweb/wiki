{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Spano</dfn>''' is a [[micropub media endpoint]] which accepts file uploads via [[Micropub]] and returns a URL for use in a subsequent Micropub post. It is created by [[User:Martymcgui.re|Marty McGuire]].

Spano makes use of [[content addressing]] so that repeated uploads of the same file do not take extra space and always returns the same URL. Additionally, revisions of files with the same name cannot overwrite one another.

== "Editions" ==

There are two editions of Spano.

=== SpanoPHP (2025 PHP edition) ===

An updated PHP version of Spano, named SpanoPHP was released in 2025. [https://git.schmarty.net/schmarty/spano-php SpanoPHP source code].

SpanoPHP uses

* an included [https://git.schmarty.net/schmarty/spano-php/src/branch/main/lib/IndieAuth/RelyingParty/Token <code>IndieAuth/RelyingParty</code>] library for handling [[IndieAuth]]
* an included (simplified) hashing file store inspired by Python HashFS
* [https://docs.guzzlephp.org Guzzle] to support both (token verification requests for IndieAuth, uploaded file streaming for the file store)

=== Spano (original Python Flask edition) ===

The original version of Spano (2017) is built on the Python [[Flask]] framework and makes use of {{ kylewm }}'s [https://github.com/kylewm/flask-micropub flask-micropub] library for handling [[IndieAuth]] and finding Micropub endpoints.

Content addressing is handled via [https://flask-hashfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Flask-HashFS].
