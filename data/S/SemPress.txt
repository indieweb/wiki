'''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/themes/sempress/ SemPress]</dfn>''' is a highly semantic [[WordPress]] Theme with HTML5 templates, responsive and seo optimized. SemPress supports most of the new HTML5 tags, the new HTML5 input-types, [[microformats]], microformats v2, and microdata (Schema.org).

It is one of the most [[friendly|IndieWeb friendly]] themes in the WordPress repository. In large part this is because of the proper use of [[microformats]] allowing it to more easily leverage plugins for [[Webmention]] and [[Micropub]] and give you the ability to interact with other websites more easily out of the box.
