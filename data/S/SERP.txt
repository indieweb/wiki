Rendering search results has been discussed within the community, particularly with regard to how search results can be represented in a way not currently used by larger, traditional search engines.

Some ideas include:

* Adding [[reply context]] to search results.
* Adding a discovery mechanism for site home pages rather than just individual pages that match a keyword.
