<span class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Safari Extensions</dfn>''' were a way to modify the Safari browser with [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]], replaced by [[Safari App Extensions]].</span> They could previously be found on Apple’s Safari Extensions Gallery (<nowiki>https://extensions.apple.com</nowiki>), until September 2019.

At [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference#2020 WWDC 2020], in June 2020, Apple [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10665/ introduced] [[Safari Web Extensions]]. These are once again allowing extension development with web technology through [[WebExtensions]] APIs, giving an alternative to Safari App Extensions. This was part of the [[Safari]] version 14 release.

== Controversy ==

On 2015-06-08, Apple revealed their new Apple Developer Program merging the three previous programs (iOS Developer Program, Mac Developer Program, and Safari Developer Program) into one. The merging means people who previously paid for 2 programs will end up only paying the single fee of 99 USD. [http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/08/apples-new-developer-program-offers-ios-os-x-and-watchos-tools-for-99/]

Everyone who is a member of the free Safari Developer Program received an email stating they “can continue building Safari extensions and bring [their] creativity to other Apple platforms by joining the Apple Developer Program.” That means going from '''free''' to a '''yearly 99 USD payment'''.

This does not only effect people who want to distribute their extensions through Apple. Safari has always ''required'' a Safari Developer Certificate to install an extension through the Extension Builder. Users can no longer download the source of an extension and build it themselves, or even contribute to open-source extensions without joining the Apple Developer Program.

[https://developer.apple.com/support/transition/ Apple states] your “existing Safari Developer Program membership will remain active until July 8, 2015 and your Safari extensions will continue to work for existing users.” This presumably means Apple will force all certificates to be invalid after July 8.

== Deprecation ==

As of Safari 12, Extensions are deprecated in favour of [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions Safari App Extensions]. These new App Extensions will work with native Object-C and Swift code instead of just HTML and JavaScript.

According to the [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/converting_a_safari_extension_to_a_safari_app_extension conversion guide] support for HTML background pages (as used for running code in [[WebExtensions]]) is dropped completely and popovers will have to be created with [[AppKit]].

As of September 2019, the Safari Extensions Gallery was shutdown completely. App Extensions have to be downloaded from the [[Mac App Store]] instead. Presumably all the old extensions have now been lost. Per Jeff Johnson, developers only had about a week notice to the sudden shutdown.
