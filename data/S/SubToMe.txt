{{stub}}

<dfn>'''[http://subtome.com SubToMe]'''</dfn> is a button that content publishers can put on their sites which enables users to subscribe to their feed in whatever [[reader]] they choose — sort of a universal follow button.

== Why ==
If my personal site has both a Twitter "Follow" button and a feed, it’s currently orders of magnitude easier to follow me on Twitter than to add my feed to a reader or any kind.

SubToMe aims at make following open web feeds (whether [[h-feed]], [[Atom]], or [[RSS]]) as easy as following a Twitter profile.

It does that by storing the subscriber's preferred subscriptions in his browser's LocalStorage, so that it does not promote service X or Y which may disappear while still making things as easy to use for the subscriber.

[https://www.subtome.com/publishers.html Adding a button] to your site is quite easy and can be fully customized. 

See '''How''' below for code to copy & paste!

== How ==
=== example follow button with Woodwind default reader ===
This example creates a button, that when clicked subscribes the user to the site "example.com" with [[Woodwind]] as a suggested default.

It specifies the following:
* data-subtome-resource - the site URL
* data-subtome-feeds - the feed URL for the site ( for Woodwind, which understands mf2, you don't need and RSS/Atom feed )
* data-subtome-suggested-service-name - this is what specifys Woodwind as a service
* data-subtome-suggested-service-url - Woodwind internal URL specifying the resource to subscribe for

Code example (assuming <code><nowiki>https://example.com/</nowiki></code> is your home page with an h-feed):
<code><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    <a onclick="(function(btn){var z=document.createElement('script');document.subtomeBtn=btn;z.src='https://www.subtome.com/load.js';document.body.appendChild(z);})(this)" 
       value="Subscribe" 
       data-subtome-resource="https://example.com/" 
       data-subtome-feeds="https://example.com/" 
       data-subtome-suggested-service-name="Woodwind" 
       data-subtome-suggested-service-url="http://woodwind.xyz/subscribe?origin={feed}"
       href="#" 
       title="subscribe to https://example.com/">Follow</a>
</pre></code>

== Indieweb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members currently using SubToMe buttons on their personal sites:

* [http://blog.superfeedr.com/ Superfeedr Blog]. The buttons have been put at the end of each blog post.
* {{kylewm}}'s https://kylewm.com has a "Subscribe" link at the bottom of each h-feed. 
* {{bret}} includes after the recent posts block in the pre-footer.
* {{voxpelli}} includes it at the bottom of his blog's front page
* {{cweiske}} has a follow button at the top of the [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/ index] and each [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/tag/php tag page].
* {{gRegor}} is experimenting with a "Follow My Notes" button at the bottom of http://gregorlove.com/notes/ with [[Woodwind]] as the suggested reader.
* {{chrisaldrich}} includes one on in right rail on most pages. Also experimenting with wrapping the code around a traditional RSS icon for possible improved UX/UI, so users can add feeds to their favorite reader rather than being taken to a page of parsed data.
* {{renem}} has a feed link at the bottom with a traditional RSS image, with a fallback to standard [[RSS]] link. Suggested reader service is [[Woodwind]]
* {{aciccarello}} has a SubToMe feed link on a [https://www.ciccarello.me/subscribe /subscribe] page as of 2022-11-10
* add yourself here

IndieWeb community members using feed readers with SubToMe support:

* {{cweiske}} using [[tt-rss|TinyTinyRSS]] with the [http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/tt-rss-subtome.htm tt-rss-subtome] plugin.
* {{kylewm}} added a SubToMe provider for [[Woodwind]] on [https://reader.kylewm.com]. The provider is activated just by visiting the site.

== Demo ==
SubToMe can be tried as a subscriber out on the project homepage: [http://subtome.com SubToMe].
Many feed readers already implement it, but you can also pick your favorite subscription tool on the [https://www.subtome.com/store.html SubToMe store].

== FAQ ==
=== Is SubToMe another service to depend on ===
Q: Is SubToMe another service to depend on?

A: SubToMe is just a convenient "domain" used to obtain a 'namespace' in the subscriber's browser when storing their preferred reader. You can host its open source code yourself on your site!

SubToMe is only static (HTML + JS + CSS) and can actually be served from any HTTP server. 

* but should not, because then you lose the shared configuration across all sites

The only constraint is the use of https for security purposes. The code is available [https://github.com/superfeedr/subtome as open source on github].
