'''<dfn><abbr>SWAT0</abbr></dfn>''' is an abbreviation for The Social Web Acid Test level 0, a user-feature interoperability test for social web functionality [http://tantek.com/2010/199/t3/fsws-social-web-acid-test-swat-v0 defined on 2010-07-18] at [[FSWS2010]], and most recently demonstrated passing with IndieWeb examples live at IndieWebCamp [[2015]].

== Summary ==
The SWAT0 test can be rephrased in IndieWeb terminology, referring to people's own websites rather than "social network" services.

# With his phone, {{benthatmustbeme}} takes a photo of {{aaronpk}}, tags him in the photo, and posts it to his site.
# {{aaronpk}} gets a notification that he's been tagged in a photo.
# {{kylewm}}, who is subscribed to {{benthatmustbeme}}, sees the photo in his [[reader]] UI.
# {{kylewm}} posts a reply to the photo from this UI, the reply is posted to his site.
# {{benthatmustbeme}} and {{aaronpk}} receive notifications that {{kylewm}} has commented on the photo.

== mapping to indieweb ==
The following indieweb mapping of the SWAT0 steps and user flow was demonstrated on 2015-07-12:

# With his [[phone]], {{benthatmustbeme}} takes a photo of {{aaronpk}}, tags him in the photo (by [[person-tagging]] with http://aaronparecki.com/) , and posts it to his site (which sends a [[webmention]] to aaronparecki.com)
# {{aaronpk}} gets a [[person-tag]] mention (a specific form of [[person mention]]) notification that he's been tagged in a photo (because his watch buzzes when he is webmentioned), because Ben Roberts's website linked to aaronpk's site with a class of "u-category h-card".
# {{kylewm}}, who follows {{benthatmustbeme}}, sees the photo in his [[reader]]. His reader being [[Woodwind]] which is pinged by {{benthatmustbeme}}'s [[PuSH]] support.
# {{kylewm}}, still using [[Woodwind]], posts a reply to the photo on his site. (using [[micropub]])
# {{benthatmustbeme}} receives a notification that {{kylewm}} has commented on the photo, via webmention to {{benthatmustbeme}}'s site about the new comment, which his server sends back to his client device (laptop browser) as a [[push notification]]
# {{aaronpk}} receives a notification of the new comment on a photo he's tagged in:
## because {{benthatmustbeme}}'s server, having received the comment, does [[salmention]] sending and thus resends a [[person-tag]] webmention to {{aaronpk}}
## then {{aaronpk}}'s server receives the [[person-tag]] webmention and does [[salmention]] receiving processing, notices the new comment on the source of the webmention, generates a push notification to aaronpk's client device ([[phone]]) that {{kylewm}} has commented on the photo {{aaronpk}} is tagged in.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Note: On 2015-07-12 {{kevinmarks}} commented on {{benthatmustbeme}} photo nearly the same time (likely before) as {{kylewm}}, also using [[Woodwind]], but signed-in using his [[Known]] install on known.kevinmarks.com. However, kylewm is noted in the example above since he wrote all the software he used (Woodwind and Red Wind). ([[eat what you cook]] tie-break).

=== implementation requirements ===
For the above to work, each of the three participants has some implementation requirements for their indieweb site/service.

Players A, B, C as identified by the [http://tantek.com/2015/029/t1/swat0-posts-tags-mobile-photo-comment tweetable summary]:

==== A must support ====
* taking and posting a [[photo]] post, with [[person-tag]]s, or separately [[person-tagging]] the photo right after posting, and sending webmentions to all links in that post
* receiving [[webmentions]] from [[reply]] posts, and showing them as [[comments]], properly marked up
* sending a push [[notification]] from their server to their client for any [[webmention]]
* [[salmention]] sending, that is when their post receives a webmention, they must resend webmentions to any in-reply-to posts and anybody person-tagged (or better, anyone [[person-mention]]ed) in their posts

==== B must support ====
* receiving [[homepage]] webmentions
* receiving [[person-tag]] mentions in particular
* passing along received webmentions as specific push [[notification]]s to their client device, e.g. that they've been "tagged in a post" and (implied) type of post too, e.g. "tagged in a photo".
* [[salmention]] receiving, that is when receiving a webmention, they must notice the new "comment" on the source of the webmention, and
* generate a push notification to their client device that someone has commented on the photo they are tagged in.

==== C must support ====
* having a [[reader]] with an integrated commenting UI, either directly as part of their site, or as a [[Micropub]] client support built into the [[reader]]
* sending a [[webmention]] from their site for a [[reply]] post to the in-reply-to post

== Silo SWAT0 ==

Silo SWAT0 is a variant where one or two people (but not all three) participate entirely inside a [[silo]]. The other participant(s) interact with the silo participants via [[POSSE]], [[backfeed]], and silo [[feed]] proxies and converters. It was [[SWAT0#2015-11-16.2F18_Silo_SWAT0_on_Facebook:_R_B_K|first demonstrated on 2015-11-16]] ([https://snarfed.org/silo-swat0-on-facebook full writeup with screenshots]).

SWAT0 revolves around a single post and its responses and notifications, so silo SWAT0 requires that post to exist inside the silo. If A (Ben) is the silo-native participant, the photo post will be published first (and only) inside the silo. If A is a non-silo participant, they must either [[POSSE]] or [[PESOS]] the photo post.

(The requirements and design for multi-silo SWAT0 are left as an exercise for the reader.)

Here are the requirements for each participant to be ''outside'' the silo:

=== A must support ===
* [[POSSE]] or [[PESOS]] [[photo]] post with [[person tag]]s
* [[backfeed]] [[replies]] to posts

=== B must support ===

* [[backfeed]] [[person tag]] to a front page (like a [[homepage]])
* [[backfeed]] [[response]]s to [[person tags]]

=== C must support ===
* [[reader]] with an integrated commenting UI and silo [[feed]] (eg [http://twitter-atom.appspot.com/ twitter-atom])
* [[POSSE]] or [[PESOS]] [[reply]]


=== Silo API support ===

Here's the current status of the major silos' API support for the more unusual features, as of 2015-11-14. Common indieweb silo features like [[POSSE]] and [[backfeed]]ing responses are omitted.

Based on the data below, it looks like [[Facebook]] and [[Flickr]] could do silo SWAT0, but [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and [[Google+]] can't.

==== POSSE person tags ====

* '''Facebook: yes.''' POST to [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/user/feed `/user/feed`] and set the `tags` param to a comma separated list of FB user ids. needs the `user_friends` permission and maybe the Taggable Friends API. [https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE_to_Facebook#Mention_Tagging Details.]
* '''Flickr: yes.''' using the [https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.people.add.html `photos.people.add`] endpoint. we'd need to do [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/432 #432] (publish support) first though.
* Twitter: no. they're called [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20156423# photo or people tags]. nothing in the [https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/uploading-media uploading media] or [https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/update `statuses/update`] docs, [https://dev.twitter.com/search/node/photo%20tags%20language%3Aen doc searches], or forum [https://twittercommunity.com/search?q=tags%20category%3A20 searches] or [https://twittercommunity.com/t/tag-users-on-pictures/54766 posts].
* Instagram: no, since the API is mostly read only. you [https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/ can't post pictures] [https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/tags/ or tags].
* Google+: no, since [https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/index#api the API is read only].

[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/459#issuecomment-154229985 (originally published here)]

==== backfeed person tags ====

* '''Facebook: yes''', via [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/photo/tags/ `/photo/tags`] (needs testing).
* '''Flickr: yes''', via [https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.people.getList.html `photos.people.getList`] etc.
* Twitter: no. photo people tags aren't exposed in the API.
* Google+: no. G+ doesn't have person tags distinct from mentions. Google Photos probably does, but it's mostly a separate product now.
* Instagram: no.

[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/488#issuecomment-156341222 (originally published here)]


==== backfeed mentions ====
* '''Twitter: yes''', via search. we [https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/master/granary/twitter.py#L353 already do this to walk reply chains].
* '''Google+: kind of.''' i tried [https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/latest/activities/search `activities/search`] for finding the _+Trisha Weir_ mention in [https://plus.google.com/+SimonNewton0/posts/4WAyTr3VgMe this post]. it didn't work with `"+Trisha Weir"`, `+Trisha Weir`, [https://plus.google.com/+TrishaWeir `https://plus.google.com/+TrishaWeir`], or [https://plus.google.com/106299364027673376307 `https://plus.google.com/106299364027673376307`], but it did work with `"Trisha Weir"`. that query will technically return posts that just have people's names without mentioning them, which means we'll get some false positives, but maybe in practice that's ok. not sure.
* Flickr: no. Flickr only has people tags ([https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/488 #488]), not mentions.
* Facebook: no. Not via notifications: They can only be read [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/notifications for pages], [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/notifications not for users]. A number of other endpoints look promising, but don't pan out. [https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+api+user+mentions Google doesn't find much either.] and FB removed search from the API in v2.0 (see [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/456 #456]).
* Instagram: no. [https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/#get_media_search search] is just for location, not text query.

[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/523#issuecomment-155523875 (originally published here)]


==== backfeed responses to person tags or mentions ====
Mostly the same as the last two items.

* '''Twitter: yes for mentions''', via search; no for photo people tags, they're not exposed in the API.
* '''Google+: kind of for mentions,''' via search. details in [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/523 #523]. no for tags.
* '''Flickr: yes''', via [https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.people.getPhotosOf.html `people.getPhotosOf`] etc.
* '''Facebook: yes for tags''', no for mentions.
* Instagram: no.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
The following are indieweb examples of passing SWAT0 according to all the requirements, including, especially the requirement to use three different sites running three different projects.

=== 2015-07-12 B A K ===
On 2015-07-12 two overlapping sets of IndieWeb community members simultaneously demonstrated SWAT0 as documented that night in: 
* [http://tantek.com/2015/193/t1/congratulations-first-indieweb-swat0 Congratulations first indieweb SWAT0 demo!] and 
* [http://tantek.com/2015/193/t2/user-flow-permalinks-indieweb-swat0 User flow and permalinks from IndieWeb SWAT0 achievement]. 
* Video: [https://aaronparecki.com/notes/2015/07/14/1/swat0 Live demo of #SWAT0 at IndieWebCamp 2015] (93 seconds)

'''Players A, B, C''' (caveats if any in parenthesesl)
* {{benthatmustbeme}}, {{aaronpk}}, {{kevinmarks}} (using a secondary site of his)
* {{benthatmustbeme}}, {{aaronpk}}, {{kylewm}}

=== Individual Roles ===
If you an get one or more roles working with your projects/site, but are unable to demonstrate it interoperating with two other different projects and sites, then add yourself here (including which roles you can support).

While not considered "passing" SWAT0 (even if you can do all three roles), you should still add yourself here (yyyy-mm-dd shortname roles-you-can-do) if you think you could pass with two other projects/sites, and try to connect with two of the folks listed above to do a demo together.

== Misconceptions ==
Common misconceptions about SWAT0 (have happened often enough to document)
==== I pass SWAT0 ====
No one individual can "pass" SWAT0, the test requires three different individuals.

Instead: state specifically which role(s) A, B, and/or C, that you are able to perform with your site.

==== My site or service passes SWAT0 ====
No one site or service can "pass" SWAT0, the test requires at least two (preferably three) different sites or services.
<blockquote>users are on at least 2 (ideally 3) different services</blockquote>

Instead: state specifically which role(s) A, B, and/or C, that user(s) on your site or service can perform. E.g. "my site/software/service can perform SWAT0 roles A,B, and C"

==== My project passes SWAT0 ====
No one project can "pass" SWAT0, the test requires at least two (preferably three) different codebases:
<blockquote>users are on at least 2 (ideally 3) different services <strong>each of which is built with a different code base</strong></blockquote> (<strong>emphasis</strong> added)

Instead: state specifically which role(s) A, B, and/or C, that user(s) running your project can perform.

== Background ==
Past iterations, fixes:

=== fixed ===
In the development of the indieweb mapping of SWAT0, the following were figured out and/or fixed:

* '''How to handle receiving a [[salmention]]''' - when you receive a webmention in-reply-to your post or person-mentioning you, your server must read not only the source post's authored properties, but also any [[responses]] like [[comments]] (or [[likes]] or [[reposts]]) that may be children of that post!
* '''How/when to send a [[salmention]]''' - when there's any [[response]] to your post, you resend webmentions to any post your post is in-reply-to, as well as anyone person-tagged in your post.
* '''How to [[people-tag]] someone in a [[photo]]'''. Merely linking in a comment/caption to someone is just a ''mention'', not a people-tag (i.e. the difference between @-mentioning someone in an [[Instagram]] comment/caption vs. actually tagging the person at a 2D point in the photo with their (…) "Tag People" UI).
** Flickr supports tagging people in photos without marking a 2D point in the photo. So I'm not sold on requiring a 2D point as part of tagging people in a photo. <span class="h-card">[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]</span> 10:34, 23 September 2014 (PDT)
** Still to be improved: [[area-tagging]] a [[person-tag]] - but not needed for SWAT0
* How does someone receiving a [[homepage]] webmention tell the '''difference between a mere mention (e.g. in a comment/caption) vs. actually being tagged (optionally at a specific point/rect''') in a [[photo]] post? I.e. we know how to distinguish between a post-mention/[[reply]]/[[RSVP]] - and hypothetically homepage-mention/[[invitation]]. Possibly by detecting that the source's link to your target is on "u-category" or a "u-url" inside a "u-category h-card"?
** This is described on [[person_mention#How_to_distinguish_person_mentions]]

=== history ===
In 2010, not long after the original SWAT0 challenge, the following protocol flow was figured out based on the proposed standards of the time: [[Activitystreams]] (Atom/XML), [[PuSH]], [[Salmon]], and [[Webfinger]]
* http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT0_-_strawman_protocol_flow

==== SWAT1 brainstorming ====
A SWAT1 was never specified, however several [https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT1_use_cases SWAT1 use cases] were proposed for consideration of what could go into a SWAT1.
