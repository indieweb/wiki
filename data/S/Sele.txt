'''<dfn><a href="https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/sele">Sele</a></dfn>''' is a [[IndieAuth]] provider (client and server) by {{jacky}}. It's meant to be friendly to [[selfhosting]]. Progress is publicly tracked on the [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/sele/milestone/57 alpha] and the [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/sele/milestone/27 final] releases, as well as the [https://git.jacky.wtf/indieweb/sele/milestone/58 backlog].

== TicketAuth ==
Sele aims to provide a working implementation of [[TicketAuth]]. In order to do this, it aims to answer a few questions intentionally left open by the specification:

* <strong>How does one send a ticket?</strong> Sele will do this in a few different ways:
** It'll subscribe to your identity's URL (site) and listen for any new [[follow]] posts.
** It'll poll your [[contacts]] from Micropub and send tickets
* <strong>How does one request a ticket?</strong> Sele provides a few moments:
** Sele provides endpoints to generate a ticket for a fixed identity.
** Sele can automatically approve ticket redemption from identities in one's [[contacts]]

=== Protecting Feeds ===
For this example with Alice (she/her) and Janet (they/them), we assume that Alice is using a [[reader]] that understands [[TicketAuth]] and Sele as her [[IndieAuth]] provider. We can also assume that Alice's reader is built to conform to ethical engagement. Janet is also using Sele in this example.

* Alice visits Janet's feed at https://janet.example/all.
* Alice's informed by Janet's website that this page requires authentication.
* Alice's reader notices TicketAuth support by this site
** This could have been detected before by checking the author's own [[representative h-card]] and looking for TicketAuth support there
** This would be done by looking for a IAM endpoint on the page itself
* Alice's reader then [[IndieAuth_Ticket_Auth#Proposed_mechanism_for_requesting_a_ticket|attempts to request a token]] and informs Alice of the lack of access and that it's waiting for a response.
* Janet's IndieAuth provider can inform Alice of this in a number of ways.
** Sele sends a periodic e-mail of a list of those requesting access.
** Sele's mobile app equivalent can poll for new ticket requests and show them.
** Sele supports sending notifications using https://ntfy.sh/, [[Pushover]], [[XMPP]] or private [[IRC]] messages.
** Sele shows a list of requests sorted by the resource (<code>realm</code>) or the requester on the dashboard.
* When Janet's provider approves this request,
** Alice's reader will continue the flow to obtain an access token for this resource.
** Alice's reader will fetch the resource using this token.
** Because Alice's reader is also built with ethical engagement, it restricts the adjustment of the replies to this feed's post by keeping the same [[audience]] of the post, carries the same [[content warning|content warnings]] and [[visibility]], if shown on the top level. It will defer to what each individual post uses (and give the user an option between them).
** Alice's reader will use that token to fetch the posts in the feed over time as well as it's implied that it's required to read those posts.
* When Janet's provider rejects the request,
** Any sort of messaging that can shown to the user is presented when this feed is attempted to be presented in the reader
** Sele will only retry this with user consent and will respect any headers around retrying.
