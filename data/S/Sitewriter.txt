Sitewriter is a simple, configurable service for adding Micropub to static web sites.

It is an open source Sinatra application (MIT license), feel free to [https://github.com/gerwitz/sitewriter fork].

A public instance is hosted at https://sitewriter.net/.

It is still very rough and requires some geek knowledge (i.e. bring your own GitHub authorization token). If you're auto-building a static site from a repository on GitHub, you can probably figure it out.

== History ==

{{gerwitz}} originally built this starting with [[Transformative]] to scratch his own itch, pushing to the GitHub repositories for his Middleman sites.

As of May 2019 it is used by four personal domains, three built with Eleventy and one with Jekyll.
