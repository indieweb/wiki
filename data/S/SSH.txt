{{stub}}

'''<dfn><kbd>ssh</kbd></dfn>''' is short for Secure SHell, a protocol for remote login, itself used by the <dfn><kbd>scp</kbd></dfn> (Secure CoPy) command, which is used by some IndieWeb community members to update their personal sites.

SSH allows a user to log from their local computer into a remote computer anywhere on the internet. It is a more secure replacement for [[telnet]].

On Windows, Linux or Mac, the <kbd>ssh</kbd> client is usually pre-installed. Most people are using [http://www.openssh.com/ OpenSSH] from the [http://www.openbsd.com/ OpenBSD] folks. GNU has its own experimental version, known as [http://www.gnu.org/software/lsh/ GNU lsh] but it is not widely used. There are various third-party applications that support SSH on Windows.

SSH servers can accept passwords, or SSH [[Key Pair|Key Pairs]] for authentication.
