{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Singulus</dfn>''' is the application that runs [https://tonyburns.net tonyburns.net] and is written by {{craftyphotons}}.

The application is built first and foremost for me to [[eat what you cook|eat what I cook]] for my own content, but by making it open source from the beginning my hope is that it will keep me accountable and perhaps be useful to others.

The source code for Singulus is available [https://github.com/craftyphotons on GitHub] and licensed under the [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT MIT License].

== Features ==

* Rapidly evolving [[Micropub]] server that currently supports creation of simple notes with photos, and the [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#media-endpoint media endpoint]
* Barebones [[IndieAuth]] server (supports authentication, authorization, revocation, verification flows but no client discovery yet)

== In Progress ==

* Publishing of additional [[post]] types ([[article]] and [[photo]] in particular)
* [[Webmention]] publishing
* [[POSSE]] to [[Twitter]]

== Roadmap ==

* [https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#client-information-discovery IndieAuth client discovery]
* [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#update Update], [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#delete delete], and [https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#querying query] support on the [[Micropub]] server.
* Support for receiving [[Webmention|Webmentions]]

== Bugs ==

* Authentication (either through [[IndieAuth]] authorization flow or via a pre-created access token) does not work with iA Writer's [[Micropub]] integration.
