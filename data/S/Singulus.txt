{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Singulus</dfn>''' is the application that runs [https://tonyburns.net tonyburns.net] and is written by {{craftyphotons}}.

The application is built first and foremost for me to [[eat what you cook|eat what I cook]] for my own content, but by making it open source from the beginning my hope is that it will keep me accountable and perhaps be useful to others.

The source code for Singulus is available [https://github.com/craftyphotons on GitHub] and licensed under the [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT MIT License].

== Roadmap ==

* [[IndieAuth]] provider
* [[Micropub]] server
* [[Webmention]] server
* [[POSSE]] for content on tonyburns.net
