'''<dfn>[https://www.slimframework.com/ Slim]</dfn>''' is a lightweight [[PHP]] framework for developing web applications and is used by several IndieWeb services and projects.

== Features ==
* HTTP routing to create clean URL slugs and map them to specific functions, including limiting the accepted request methods (GET, POST, etc.)
* Supports [https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/ PSR-7: HTTP message interface] for interacting with the URL, HTTP status, headers, and body
* Supports [https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/ PSR-11: Container interface] for dependency injection
* Does not include services for authentication, database abstraction, template engine, etc. which keeps it lightweight and easy to add in only the components you need

== IndieWeb Examples ==
These IndieWeb sites and services use Slim:

* [[IndieNews]]
* [[indiebookclub]]
* {{barnaby}}'s [https://github.com/Taproot/micropub-adapter Micropub Adapter] includes an [https://github.com/Taproot/micropub-adapter/tree/main/example example implementation with Slim]
* [[Teacup]]
* [[indiewebify.me]]: There is currently a [https://github.com/indieweb/indiewebify-me/issues/82 project] to migrate this to Slim from the no longer maintained Silex framework
