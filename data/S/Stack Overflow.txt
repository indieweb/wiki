'''<dfn>[http://stackoverflow.com/ Stack Overflow]</dfn>''' is a [[question]] and [[answer]] [[silo]] specifically for programmers.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no known actual IndieWeb examples of posting questions or answers on Stack Overflow that originated from your website.

{{aaronpk}} has posted at least one answer directly to Stack Overflow:
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59911194/how-to-calculate-pckes-code-verifier/59913241#59913241

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE ===
It’s theoretically possible to [[POSSE]] posts of at least two kinds to Stack Overflow:
* [[question]]
* [[reply]]

However it’s not clear anyone has done this yet.

=== backfeed ===
Similarly, if you POSSE a question post, you could [[backfeed]] replies to that back to your own site.

== Criticism ==
=== Not trustworthy ===

<blockquote>Stack Overflow, Inc. has decreed a near-total prohibition on moderating Al-generated content in the wake of a flood of such content being posted to and subsequently removed from the Stack Exchange network, tacitly allowing the proliferation of incorrect information ("hallucinations") and unfettered plagiarism on the Stack Exchange network. This poses a major threat to the integrity and trustworthiness of the platform and its content.</blockquote>
