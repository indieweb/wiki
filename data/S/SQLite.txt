<dfn>SQLite</dfn> is a relational database that stores an entire database in a single file. Unlike most databases, it is accessed as a library rather than a separate process.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{petermolnar}} uses [https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#fts4 SQLite3 FTS4] engine for full text searching his site.
* {{cweiske}} uses SQLite as temporary datastore when re-building his static blog after pushing changes onto the server
* {{jacky}} uses SQLite as the primary database in [[Koype]], [[Shock]], [[Koype]] and [[Lighthouse]]. It also powers the property searching functionality of Koype via a custom [https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html virtual table].
* {{beesbuzz.biz}} uses SQLite as the primary database in [[Publ]], and prefers that storage engine for [[Feed on Feeds]].

=== Previous Examples ===
* Until ~2015ish
** {{kylewm}} is experimenting with SQLite as the primary datastore for [[Red Wind]].

== Software Examples ==
* [[Sandstorm]] recommends that apps use SQLite if possible because each application runs in its own container, and therefore cannot share a single e.g., [[MySQL]] instance.
