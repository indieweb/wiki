{{stub}}

<div class="p-summary">'''<dfn>Sign In with Apple</dfn>''' is an authorization api similar to social silo login buttons that allows a user to sign in using their Apple device. Personal websites could allow this as a more secure sign in when IndieAuth is not available but social silos are not preferred.</div>

In order to implement this on a personal website, the website owner does have to enroll with an Apple Developer account. It is currently not defined whether a free Apple Developer account can be used or if it has to be a paid Apple Developer account. This will be updated with clarification once that is determined.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* No IndieWeb examples currently.

== Brainstorming ==
=== Alternative to IndieAuth ===
* {{eddiehinkle}} is investigating using sign in with Apple on his website as an alternative for friends and family that don't have IndieAuth.
=== handler for rel me to email ===
{{t}}: thinking out loud: since we (e.g. signing into the wiki) used to support rel=me links to email addresses using [[Persona]], and Apple sign-in depends on email addresses, couldn't we also use Sign in with Apple to support email rel=me links as part of a [[RelMeAuth]] solution? Maybe have [[IndieLogin]] support it? Worth filing an issue on that for this idea? 

== Notes ==

* You need [[SPF]] records configured on the domain you want to use Sign In with Apple on.
* Their token endpoint requires including a <code>User-Agent</code> header, otherwise you get an HTML error page back
* Their authorization endpoint is not documented, but it is <code>https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize</code>
* The client_id value is the Services ID that you create during setup
