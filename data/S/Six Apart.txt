'''<dfn>Six Apart</dfn>''' was the software company that created the popular [[Movable Type]] (MT) blogging tool, [[Vox]] & [[Typepad]] blogging services, acquired [[Livejournal]] & [[Pownce]], eventually merged with [[VideoEgg]] to become [[SAY Media]], which in 2011 spun out the Six Apart brand, MT business, and co-founders to Infocom in Japan.

The current company named Six Apart is a spinoff that only maintains Movable Type; the rest of the company continued as [[SAY Media]], which was later acquired by '''TheMaven''', which is now '''The Arena Group'''.
