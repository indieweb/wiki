'''<dfn>SAML</dfn>''' is an older set of identity standards often used by enterprises and governments for single-sign-on that has a trusted certificate single point of vulnerability, exploited in 2020 to sign-into numerous high value US government and other accounts, in contrast to [[IndieAuth]], which by its distributed nature has no single point of certificate vulnerability.

** "Have you considered using IndieAuth (https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org) which does the same now?<br><br>I’ve implemented it on my personal site (https://github.com/shurcooL/home/issues/34) and I’m very happy with it. Especially during GitHub outages." [https://dmitri.shuralyov.com @dmitshur] April 10, 2020
