'''<dfn>[http://superfeedr.com Superfeedr]</dfn>''' provides a variety of ways to access real-time [[feed]] updates, including a popular [[PubSubHubbub]]-0.4 compliant hub. Publishing and subscribing to their PuSH hub is a free service, and they also offer a paid service (with a free tier for low volume users) that handles all the polling, bookkeeping, and logistics of monitoring feeds of all kinds (XML, HTML, JSON) for updates. This includes feeds that do not ping a Superfeedr hub and feeds that do not support PuSH at all.
