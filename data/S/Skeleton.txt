== Why ==
Skeleton can be useful if you want to add a responsive grid without using a heavy framework like [[Bootstrap]].

There are at least three forks of Skeleton currently:
* https://github.com/oltmannsdaniel/skeleton-plus
* http://legacyframework.xyz/
* https://github.com/skeleton-framework/skeleton-framework

== Issues ==
