'''<dfn>[http://Squarespace.com Squarespace]</dfn>''' is a content hosting service (paid) that provides services such as blogging and domain hosting.

Squarespace is somewhere between a [[silo]] like WordPress.com and a full fledged web [[hosting]] service.

== How To ==
=== IndieAuth with rel-me links ===
@@ need instructions for SquareSpace V7 @@

=== Your own domain ===
* [http://help.squarespace.com/guides/mapping-a-domain-general-instructions General instructions]

=== Export your data from Squarespace ===

Content in a Squarespace site can be exported as XML:

[http://help.squarespace.com/guides/can-i-export-my-site Can I export my site?] - yes you can. "The file exported will in be in an .xml format that can be imported into a Wordpress installation."

Individual pages can also be read as JSON:

For example, the page at http://developers.squarespace.com can be read as JSON at http://developers.squarespace.com?format=json and at http://developers.squarespace.com/?format=json-pretty 

The JSON responses for Squarespace pages include the HTML rendered text of the body of the page, together with a limited set of metadata.

=== Principles Support ===
During the 2018 Superbowl, Squarespace had several ads featuring Keanu Reeves that were very supportive of IndieWeb [[principles]]:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqnhN2Rzaqc - "Make It With Keanu Reeves" <blockquote>When passion meets inspiration, an obsession is born. Hold on to this dream and tell the world. All you need is a domain and a website from Squarespace. The world is waiting. Make it.</blockquote>
** (more quotes needed from the video(s) that advocate specific indieweb principles at least in meaning, if not directly by use of similar language)

== Issues ==
* The 'gallery' page type is limited and not very customisable. For instance, you can't use it to tell a rich photo story easily [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-04#t1417734397410 tommorris on IRC 2014-12-04]

== Historical Issues ==
* Squarespace uses hash-based URLs to link from folder pages to content pages (replicated with both text and gallery pages). Hash(bang) URLs are inherently brittle, add complexity and [http://www.w3.org/blog/2011/05/hash-uris/ go against the advice of the W3C]. I don't want the "wrong" URL being shared.

* Criticism: default blogs do not provide an archives link for browsing archives by year / month etc.
* Criticism: default blogs do not come with a search box
* Issue: exporting requires manual copy pasting: https://hachyderm.io/@liztai/109817399695999637
