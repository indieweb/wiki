'''<dfn>[https://squarespace.com Squarespace]</dfn>''' is a content hosting service (paid) that provides services such as blogging and domain hosting.

Squarespace is somewhere between a [[silo]] like WordPress.com and a full fledged web [[hosting]] service.

== How To ==
=== IndieAuth with rel-me links ===
@@ need instructions for SquareSpace V7 @@

=== Your own domain ===
* [http://help.squarespace.com/guides/mapping-a-domain-general-instructions General instructions]

=== Export your data from Squarespace ===
From Squarespace help, "[https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206566687 Exporting your site]" (link is [[js;dr]]), certain content can be exported in XML for WordPress:
<blockquote>
"You can export certain content from your Squarespace site into an .xml file. This is useful if you want to export content to WordPress. Not everything will export, as many features rely on our platformâ€™s JavaScript and CSS."
</blockquote>
<!-- previous help link no longer works as of 2023-02-06: http://help.squarespace.com/guides/can-i-export-my-site -->

However, note from the [[Squarespace#XML_export|criticism below]] that this XML export is a proprietary format that requires clean up to import to WordPress.

Individual pages can also be read as JSON:

For example, the page at http://developers.squarespace.com can be read as JSON at http://developers.squarespace.com?format=json and at http://developers.squarespace.com/?format=json-pretty 

The JSON responses for Squarespace pages include the HTML rendered text of the body of the page, together with a limited set of metadata.

=== Principles Support ===
During the 2018 Superbowl, Squarespace had several ads featuring Keanu Reeves that were very supportive of IndieWeb [[principles]]:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqnhN2Rzaqc - "Make It With Keanu Reeves" <blockquote>When passion meets inspiration, an obsession is born. Hold on to this dream and tell the world. All you need is a domain and a website from Squarespace. The world is waiting. Make it.</blockquote>
** (more quotes needed from the video(s) that advocate specific indieweb principles at least in meaning, if not directly by use of similar language)

== Criticism ==
=== XML export ===
At least one person has complained that the XML export does not import easily into WordPress and chose to manually copy/paste pages instead:

<blockquote>
"I think I've finished literally copying & pasting 300 pages of my #Squarespace blog to my staging site, and I'm ready to transfer my domain over to Wordpress.Pardon me while I collapse in a corner.#Website #IndieWeb" 

<cite>[https://hachyderm.io/@liztai/109817399695999637 @liztai], 2023-02-06</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Super proprietary so their XML export file is literally gibberish when transferred to Wordpress.

Ok, not gibberish but requires massive amounts of clean up. Might as well just copy & paste - it's faster!"
<cite>[https://hachyderm.io/@liztai/109817447845175610 @liztai], 2023-02-06</cite>
</blockquote>

The Squarespace help page also indicates several types of content that won't export:

<blockquote>
What content won't export
* Other page types (including album pages, cover pages, index pages, info pages, events pages, portfolio pages, and store pages)
* Content in page-specific headers, footers, and sidebars
* More than one blog page
* Folders
* Audio blocks
* Product blocks
* Video blocks
* Drafts
* Style settings
* Custom CSS

== Issues ==
* The 'gallery' page type is limited and not very customisable. For instance, you can't use it to tell a rich photo story easily [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-04#t1417734397410 tommorris on IRC 2014-12-04]

== Historical Issues ==
* Squarespace uses hash-based URLs to link from folder pages to content pages (replicated with both text and gallery pages). Hash(bang) URLs are inherently brittle, add complexity and [http://www.w3.org/blog/2011/05/hash-uris/ go against the advice of the W3C]. I don't want the "wrong" URL being shared. [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-04#t1417734397410 tommorris on IRC 2014-12-04]
