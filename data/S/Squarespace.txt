'''<dfn>[http://Squarespace.com Squarespace]</dfn>''' is a content hosting service (paid) that provides services such as blogging and domain hosting.

Squarespace is somewhere between a [[silo]] like WordPress.com and a full fledged web [[hosting]] service.

=== Your own domain ===

=== Export your data from Squarespace ===

Content in a Squarespace site can be exported as XML:

[http://help.squarespace.com/guides/can-i-export-my-site Can I export my site?] - yes you can. "The file exported will in be in an .xml format that can be imported into a Wordpress installation."

Individual pages can also be read as JSON:

For example, the page at http://developers.squarespace.com can be read as JSON at http://developers.squarespace.com?format=json and at http://developers.squarespace.com/?format=json-pretty 

The JSON responses for Squarespace pages include the HTML rendered text of the body of the page, together with a limited set of metadata.

== Issues ==
* The 'gallery' page type is limited and not very customisable. For instance, you can't use it to tell a rich photo story easily [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-04#t1417734397410 tommorris on IRC 2014-12-04]

== Historical Issues ==
* Squarespace uses hash-based URLs to link from folder pages to content pages (replicated with both text and gallery pages). Hash(bang) URLs are inherently brittle, add complexity and [http://www.w3.org/blog/2011/05/hash-uris/ go against the advice of the W3C]. I don't want the "wrong" URL being shared.
