'''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-location/ Simple Location]</dfn>''' is an Indieweb-friendly [[WordPress]] plugin that enhances posts with [[location]] information. It also supports [[venue]] and weather as additional features.

== Development == 
Development for the plugin is done on its [https://github.com/dshanske/simple-location Github repository]. Issues and pull requests are welcome to be posted there.

== Location in comments ==
By a happy stroke of luck with data transport via [[Bridgy]], [[backfeed|backfed]] [[webmentions]] from silos like Twitter that provide location data will also allow Simple Location to indicate the location of the commenter in comments.
* Example: Note [http://boffosocko.com/2017/10/22/set-up-files-for-the-book/#comment-37433 here] how the comment backfed from Twitter shows the location under the comment. (Full mapping functionality isn't yet included as of 10/2017, but the location name is shown.)
