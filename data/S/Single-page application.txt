A '''<dfn>single-page application</dfn>''' ('''SPA''') is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a user experience similar to that of a desktop application.  A typical use case for implementing a SPA would be for a [[PWA]] where an app-like feel is intended with instant transitions between views/pages.
