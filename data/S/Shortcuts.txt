'''<dfn>Shortcuts</dfn>''' is an iOS app formerly known as Workflow used to automate various actions. With the advanced "Get contents of URL" action it can be used to make [[Micropub]] requests or upload files to a [[media endpoint]].

== Instagram POSSE ==

{{Sebsel}} uses Shortcuts to post photo's to his site, and then POSSE them to his [[Instagram]].

His shortcut is as follows. Note that most of the bulletpoints, once set, run automatically. You need to [[obtaining-an-access-token|obtain an Access Token]] to your Micropub Endpoint, or steal one from a Micropub client you already use.

A desciption of the flow can be found at [[Shortcuts/Instagram POSSE]]

== IndieAuth ==

{{sebsel}} made a Shortcut that does the IndieAuth dance for you, in order to pick up a token. It can be embedded into Micropub workflows, as it returns the token.

The current version required one weird copy-paste step, because iOS is not able to parse attributes after a redirect to the Shortcut app.

== Micropub Media Endpoint ==

=== Pre-Built Shortcut ===
You can download a pre-built Shortcut that allows you to upload files to your media endpoint using the Share Sheet, or if the Shortcut is activated outside the share sheet it will present an option to upload from your Photos library or from the Files app.
