'''<dfn>Shortcuts</dfn>''' is an iOS app formerly known as Workflow used to automate various actions. With the advanced "Get contents of URL" action it can be used to make [[Micropub]] requests or upload files to a [[media endpoint]].

== Instagram POSSE ==

{{Sebsel}} uses Shortcuts to post photo's to his site, and then POSSE them to his [[Instagram]].

A desciption of the (old) flow can be found at [[Shortcuts/Instagram POSSE]]

A new, pre-build version can be downloaded. This one makes use of a few other flows. After import, you can customize to your needs.

* The '''Location as Geo URI''' Shortcut for location: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f88b056be79946699aa351d26efb348b
* The '''Fetch Micropub endpoint''' Shortcut for the endpoint: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/efeae51596784fb7844791d7159d642a
* The '''IndieAuth''' Shortcut for authentication: see below.
* The '''Post Photo''' Shortcut itself: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fbdebaac81ae4de69cb623f7fbfa8bed

Note: currently Shortcuts is not able to parse the Location header out of the Micropub request. This means it cannot show you your new post, unless your Micropub endpoint returns the link also in the body. This is non standard, but the Shortcut will detect it and show you your post if it can. If you see your post and want to POSSE to Instagram after it, just return to the Shortcuts app.

== IndieAuth ==

{{sebsel}} made a Shortcut that does the IndieAuth dance for you, in order to pick up a token. It can be embedded into Micropub workflows, as it returns the token.

The current version required one weird copy-paste step, because iOS is not able to parse attributes after a redirect to the Shortcut app.

== Micropub Media Endpoint ==

=== Pre-Built Shortcut ===
You can download a pre-built Shortcut that allows you to upload files to your media endpoint using the Share Sheet, or if the Shortcut is activated outside the share sheet it will present an option to upload from your Photos library or from the Files app.
