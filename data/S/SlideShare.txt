{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://www.slideshare.net/ SlideShare]</dfn>''' is a [[presentation]] hosting/sharing [[silo]], owned by [[LinkedIn]], which is now owned by [[Microsoft]], that requires [[Javascript]] just to navigate to next/previous slides. 

Slide decks can be uploaded, are converted to images and can then be viewed in the browser.

== Issues ==
=== js;dn ===
SlideShare heavily (and often unnecessarily) depends on Javascript, e.g. just to navigate to next/previous slides. Thus js;dn (Javascript Required; Didn't Navigate), related to but not quite as bad as [[js;dr]].
