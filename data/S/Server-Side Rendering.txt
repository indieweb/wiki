{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Server-Side Rendering</dfn>''' (SSR), is the traditional technique of rendering HTML pages on the server, as opposed to [[Client-Side Rendering]] using [[JavaScript]] in the browser. This is a positive movement because it allows developers that enjoy modern JavaScript libraries to continue using their skills while deploying websites that can respond to standard HTTP requests and inter operate with IndieWeb technologies such as [[Webmention]] and [[Microformats]].
