{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Site name</dfn>''' is the explicit or implied name of a site, as opposed to the name of individual elements or pages.

= Use Cases = 

* [[comment-presentation]] 
** Example: Bob mentioned this article on bob.com vs Bob mentioned this article on Bob's Site Name.

Why not just "Bob mentioned this article" ? No need for the extra stuff. If you need linktext to link to the permalink of the mention, use a datetime stamp, that's common practice.

= Implementation = 

A site name can be either implied(derived from other elements), or explicit, identified in the markup.

== Explicit ==

* The [[OGP]] defines the ''site_name'' property. It can be used like this: <pre><meta property="og:site_name" content="IMDb" /></pre>

== Implied ==

There is not currently a widely adopted way of deriving a site name from other values.

=== Thoughts ===

In the absence of an explicit site name, site name could be derived from:

* Title tag of the site's home page
* The top-level <code>h-*</code> and use its <code>p-name</code> property.
* The domain name of the site

= IndieWeb Examples =

* {{kartik}}'s site https://kartikprabhu.com is named "Parallel Transport" markedup with <code>h-feed > p-name</code>.
* {{voxpelli}} marks up https://webmention.herokuapp.com using <code>h-x-app > p-name</code>.
