{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Shock</dfn>''' is what {{jacky}} uses to combine his use of [[Micropub]] and [[Webmention]] services. It uses [https://tera.netlify.app/ Tera], a [https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/ Jinja]-like templating language in [[Rust]] for rendering themes. The project is still in an alpha state and is not ready for people not familiar with deploying Rust applications.

= Features =
* Presents contents using a theme for [[notes]], [[articles]], [[replies]] and [[bookmarks]].

== Planned ==
* [https://git.jacky.wtf/me/shock/issues/5 Rendering on multiple feed types]
** [[AS2]]
** [[Atom]] (and [[RSS]])
** Generating [[OPML]] [https://git.jacky.wtf/me/shock/issues/31 representing all the site's feeds]
* Provide better support for presenting [[photos]], [[rsvp]], [[edit]]s, [[events]], [[videos]], [[audio]], [[read]]-of posts, [[listen]]-of posts, [[game play|gameplay]], [[code]] snippets, [[purchase|purchases]] and [[collections]]
* in-browser editing of themes
* Swapping themes on-demand
* Guest sign-in using [[IndieAuth]]
* Implementing [[private post]]s support
* [[search|Search]] functionality
* [https://git.jacky.wtf/me/shock/issues/1 Real-time updates from Micropub servers]
* [https://git.jacky.wtf/me/shock/issues/20 Freezing posts]
* Template tag for generating [[The-Open-Graph-protocol|Open Graph Protocol-friendly]] and [[Twitter_Cards|Twitter]] metadata
* Custom data fetching using Lua scripts to render on the site
* Based on the <code>Host</code> header, switch the [[destination]] to serve
* Shows [[Webmention]] and [[WebSub]] endpoint information on [[#Webmention_and_WebSub_Endpoint_Showing|pages that enable it]] [https://git.jacky.wtf/me/shock/issues/33 tracked at git.jacky.wtf]]

=== Webmention and WebSub Endpoint Showing ===
Since Shock is a [[Micropub]] client, it has no insight into the details of one's Micropub design. The heuristic used to determine if a Webmention endpoint will be shown is as follows:

* if the resource does not have the property 'notifications', show the endpoint
* if it ''does'' have the propertyâ€¦
** if the value has the value 'webmention', show the WebSub endpoint to let people when it gets updated
** if the value has the value 'websub', show the WebSub endpoint to allow incoming Webmentions

=== NodeInfo Reporting ===
I'd like to emit [https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/protocol.html NodeInfo] information on my site to help non-IndieWeb entities understand what I use in a machine-friendly way. I'll aim to support the 2.1 version first, then work backwards.
