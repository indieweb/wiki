'''<dfn>Sonic</dfn>''' is a Santa Rosa-based service provider (ISP) that provides internet access in San Francisco and Sonoma county.

== Why ==
You should use Sonic if you can because they support [[Net Neutrality]] and have a strong [[privacy]] policy. Much better than competing ISPs like [[Comcast]].

Especially if you host a website at home (e.g. like on an [[indiebox]]), you should use Sonic.
