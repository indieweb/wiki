** This isn't generally seen as robust as using [[Bridgy]] with [[webmentions]] enabled, but some users may prefer it depending on their needs.
* Ties in nicely with IndieWeb Taxonomy Plugin (as of SNAP version 3.4.10): 
** [[POSSE reply]] support: when you add a tweet URL into the response field for a post, when sharing to twitter, it will share AS a reply. Keeping the conversation stream instead of creating a lone tweet. [added by david peach]
*** One thing I will also send to the makers of SNAP is to only send as a reply if both the response URL has a tweet URL AS WELL AS the 'reply' kind being chosen.
