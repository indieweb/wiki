'''<dfn>[https://www.strava.com/ Strava]</dfn>''' is a [[run]] and [[bicycle]] exercise tracking [[silo]] that also has native client apps.

== How to Export ==
You can <span id="Export">export</span> your Strava data either as individual activities or as a bulk export.

=== Bulk export ===
# Go to https://www.strava.com/ and login to your account
# Go to https://www.strava.com/settings/profile
# Scroll down and under the "Download your data" click the "Download" link or button
# Wait for your export to show up in your email

The bulk export consists of a .zip archive folder of one file per activity, named after the date-time YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-EXERCISE.gpx where EXERCISE is a word like "Run". Each file contains only the name of the activity, e.g. "Morning Run", the start-time, and then a GPX trk of timestamped latlongele points of the exercise.

Not included:
* Kudos (Strava [[like]] equivalent) on activities
* [[comments|Comments]] on activities
* [[photo|Photos]] added to activities

=== Activity Export ===
You can view your activities in a list here: 
* https://www.strava.com/athlete/training
* From there, you can click on an individual activity permalink
* Then add "/export_original" to the end of the URL and it will download a JSON file with much more information than a [[GPX]]

Not included: 
* Kudos (Strava [[like]] equivalent) on activities
* [[comments|Comments]] on activities
* [[photo|Photos]] added to activities

=== API ===

* The [https://strava.github.io/api/ Strava API] offers access to detailed data, which also includes kudos/likes, segment results, etc.

=== Third party tools ===
* You can use [https://tapiriik.com/ tapiriik] (for free) to sync GPS files between a number of destinations, including a Dropbox folder.
** This will not sync manually created activities.
* Strava offers an API with a healthy ecosystem. Maybe other services offer export...?
* On [[2017|IWS 2017]], [[User:Sebastian.kip.pe|Sebastian Kippe]] added Strava to Huginn, an open source IFTT alternative in Ruby. See his [[2017/Demos#Sebastian_Kippe|demo]]

== Features ==
''(this section is a stub and needs expansion!)''

Strava is a specialized silo for tracking distance and speed of activities, so it offers a lot of different views on your data. Most features are visualizations of your runs/rides, one by one or overall averages.

In 2017-10, Strava started supporting 'posts', which are [[notes]] with optional [[photo]]s, not accompanied by an activity. [https://blog.strava.com/posts/ Blogpost about posts].

Overviews of activities: (need to be logged in to view)
* [https://www.strava.com/dashboard Dashboard / Activity Feed] - [[feed]] style display of activities by people you follow, or only your own.
* [https://www.strava.com/athlete/training Training Log] - reverse chronological list of your exercise activities, shown as a calendar, one week per row, infinite scrollable.
* [https://www.strava.com/athlete/calendar Training Calendar] - calendar view, per month.
* [https://www.strava.com/athlete/training My Activities] - table view of all activities

Other features:
* '''Routes''' - map with route to follow while running. Make your own private ones, share with friends, or use public routes.
* '''Segments''' - parts of routes, with their own Leaderboards and Personal Records, with a lot of sub-sections on age, gender and weight class.
* '''Shoe and bike tracking''' - you can keep track of how much miles / kilometers you ran on your shoes and rode on your bike. You can pick a bike / pair of shoes per ride / run, which will add the distance to the total distance on the bike / shoes.
* ...

== Brainstorming ==
If we could submit feature requests to Strava, e.g. to make it more indieweb [[friendly]], what would we specifically request?

== Criticism ==
* Sign-up requires birthday (year month and day)

== Downtime ==
* 2017-02-28 Stravaâ€™s iOS app was nearly completely broken likely due to that day's [[S3]] outage: [[File:2017-02-28-strava-ios-down.png|320px]]
