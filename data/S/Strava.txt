'''<dfn>[https://www.strava.com/ Strava]</dfn>''' is a [[run]] and [[bicycle]] exercise tracking [[silo]] that also has native client apps.

== How to Export ==
You can <span id="Export">export</span> your Strava data either as individual activities or as a bulk export.

=== Bulk export ===
# Go to https://www.strava.com/ and login to your account
# Go to https://www.strava.com/settings/profile
# Scroll down and under the "Download your data" click the "Download" link or button
# Wait for your export to show up in your email

The bulk export consists of a .zip archive folder of one file per activity, named after the date-time YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-EXERCISE.gpx where EXERCISE is a word like "Run". Each file contains only the name of the activity, e.g. "Morning Run", the start-time, and then a GPX trk of timestamped latlongele points of the exercise.

Not included:
* Kudos (Strava [[like]] equivalent) on activities
* [[comments|Comments]] on activities
* [[photo|Photos]] added to activities

More details:
* https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export

=== Activity Export ===
You can view your activities in a list here: 
* https://www.strava.com/athlete/training
* From there, you can click on an individual activity permalink
* Then add "/export_original" to the end of the URL and it will download a JSON file with much more information than a [[GPX]]

Not included: 
* Kudos (Strava [[like]] equivalent) on activities
* [[comments|Comments]] on activities
* [[photo|Photos]] added to activities

=== API ===

* The [https://strava.github.io/api/ Strava API] offers access to detailed data, which also includes kudos/likes, segment results, etc.

=== Third party tools ===
* You can use [https://tapiriik.com/ tapiriik] (for free) to sync GPS files between a number of destinations, including a Dropbox folder.
** This will not sync manually created activities.
* Strava offers an API with a healthy ecosystem. Maybe other services offer export...?
* On [[2017|IWS 2017]], [[User:Sebastian.kip.pe|Sebastian Kippe]] added Strava to Huginn, an open source IFTT alternative in Ruby. See his [[2017/Demos#Sebastian_Kippe|demo]]

== Features ==
''(this section is a stub and needs expansion!)''

Strava is a specialized silo for tracking distance and speed of activities, so it offers a lot of different views on your data. Most features are visualizations of your runs/rides, one by one or overall averages.

In 2017-10, Strava started supporting 'posts', which are [[notes]] with optional [[photo]]s, not accompanied by an activity. [https://blog.strava.com/posts/ Blogpost about posts].

Overviews of activities: (need to be logged in to view)
* [https://www.strava.com/dashboard Dashboard / Activity Feed] - [[feed]] style display of activities by people you follow, or only your own.
* [https://www.strava.com/athlete/training Training Log] - reverse chronological list of your exercise activities, shown as a calendar, one week per row, infinite scrollable.
* [https://www.strava.com/athlete/calendar Training Calendar] - calendar view, per month.
* [https://www.strava.com/athlete/training My Activities] - table view of all activities

Other features:
* '''Routes''' - map with route to follow while running. Make your own private ones, share with friends, or use public routes.
* '''Segments''' - parts of routes, with their own Leaderboards and Personal Records, with a lot of sub-sections on age, gender and weight class.
* '''Shoe and bike tracking''' - you can keep track of how much miles / kilometers you ran on your shoes and rode on your bike. You can pick a bike / pair of shoes per ride / run, which will add the distance to the total distance on the bike / shoes.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Cam Pegg ===
{{campegg}} uses Strava and has been [[PESOS]]ing at least some of his runs since at least 2018
* 2018-10-07 https://campegg.com/activities/1890664190
* ...

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} has occasionally manually written PESOS-like posts for his races or notable <abbr title="personal records">PRs</a> on Strava and linked back to the original Strava Activity since ~2017:
* https://tantek.com/2017/067/t1/chasing-friends-200m-400m-pr
* https://tantek.com/2017/142/t1/beautiful-day-people-baytobreakers

He’s also occasionally written posts that are primarily about a Strava activity but with very different prose so aren’t really a PESOS per se:

== Brainstorming ==
=== What IndieWeb Features ===
If we could submit feature requests to Strava, e.g. to make it more indieweb [[friendly]], what would we specifically request?

* ...

=== POSSE ===
There are several places and way where it would be great to be able to POSSE to Strava:

* [[exercise]] posts - what Strava calls "activities" - you can upload a GPX file for an activity recorded elsewhere, and Strava has ways to OAuth in from other site (likes the [[Suunto]] site movescount.com) - so this should be possible from your own site as well, at a minimum by simulating a GPX import into Strava.
** you can attach (a lot of) photos to a Strava activity and give each one a caption
* [[like]] posts - you should be able to "like" an "activity" on Strava and POSSE it as a Strava "Kudos" on that activity.
* [[reply]] posts - you should be able to POSSE a reply post to an "activity" with comment text.

support.strava.com - Strava's support site has some of the usual support forum POSSE opportunities
* [[reply]] to a post there
** e.g. https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000625890/comments/115000617290
* [[like]] or downvote a post
* post a new [[article]] in their support forum, on a specific subject like https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/200537377-New-Feature-Ideas with a name (title) and (apparently) plain text content.
** e.g. https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000741210-Area-encircled-per-distance-activity-per-month-challenge-and-year (may be "Pending Approval")

Bridgy Feature request: 
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/780 Bridgy Publish to Strava.com (new silo) #780]

tapiriik is a "sync" app that will synchronize activities between many exercise apps and could, potentially, serve as a POSSE app in place of Bridgy.  The app is also open source so you could look at how they connect and translate from each of the connected sites.

=== backfeed ===
Similarly there are backfeed opportunities from Strava POSSE copies:
* kudos - backfeed as a [[like]]
* comments - backfeed as [[replies]]

and from support.strava.com
* [[comments]]
* upvotes (as [[likes]]) and downvotes

Bridgy Feature request:
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/781 Bridgy backfeed from Strava.com (new silo) #781]

== Criticism ==
* Sign-up requires birthday (year month and day)

== Downtime ==
* 2017-02-28 Strava’s iOS app was nearly completely broken likely due to that day's [[S3]] outage: [[File:2017-02-28-strava-ios-down.png|320px]]

It seems like they’re forgetting that this is ultimately data you create and you authorize these apps to use in ways that you’ve approved. That’s the entire point of the API, and by and large 3rd party apps do fant
