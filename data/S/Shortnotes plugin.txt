'''<dfn>[https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortnotes/ Shortnotes plugin]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin which provides a custom post type with [[Gutenberg]] blocks support for posting [[notes]] to your website.

The Notes post type uses only basic content blocks like paragraph, image, gallery, video, and embed. Using a defined list of relatively simple blocks helps to keep notes simple.

The plugin is maintained by {{jeremyfelt}}.
