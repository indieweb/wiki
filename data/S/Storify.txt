'''<dfn>[https://web.archive.org/web/20220302061407/https://storify.com/ Storify]</dfn>''' was a [[silo]] for creating [[collections]], acquired by [[Livefyre]] in 2013, then [[Adobe]] in 2016, and shut down 2018-05-16. It was commonly used to collect [[tweets]] but custom text, photos, and links could also be included.

== How to export ==
To get a static HTML file you can simply append .html to the storify url, e.g. <nowiki>https://storify.com/yangbodu/pdf14</nowiki> becomes <nowiki>https://storify.com/yangbodu/pdf14.html</nowiki> The HTML contains the text of collected posts and is thus easier to archive (send it to archive.org too while it is still available!).

Alternatively, you can follow the more complex instructions from <nowiki>https://storify.com/faq-eol</nowiki> to get the same result:
<blockquote>
