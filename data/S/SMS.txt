'''<dfn>SMS</dfn>''', <dfn>t(e)xt [[messaging]]</dfn>, or <dfn>t(e)xting</dfn> is a highly insecure way to send short text messages to or from a cell phone, also often used as a second factor for [[TFA]], or worse, password reset (has resulted in account hijackings), and is misguidedly <em>encouraged</em> for such in [[iOS]] version 10+, [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and other software or services that nag you to associate an SMS phone number with your account on their systems.

MMS is used for sending media such as photos in otherwise "text" messages.

== Criticism ==
=== Insecure Account Recovery ===

* 2018-07-17 Motherboard: [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin The SIM Hijackers] <blockquote>Meet the hackers who flip seized Instagram handles and cryptocurrency in a shady, buzzing underground market for stolen accounts and usernames. Their victims' weakness? Phone numbers.</blockquote> … <blockquote>'''“With someone's phone number,” a hacker who does SIM swapping told me, “you can get into every account they own within minutes and they can't do anything about it.”'''</blockquote>

=== Insecure Second Auth Factor ===
* 2018-08-01 [https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/ We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know.]
** "Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept. We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA."

* 2018-07-17 Motherboard: [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin The SIM Hijackers] <blockquote>By hijacking Rachel’s phone number, the hackers were able to seize not only Rachel’s Instagram, but her Amazon, Ebay, Paypal, Netflix, and Hulu accounts too. '''None of the security measures Rachel took to secure some of those accounts, including two-factor authentication, mattered once the hackers took control of her phone number.'''</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.

== Silo Examples ==
(need screenshots from the nag-ware screens from [[Apple]] ([[iOS]] 9+ nags you on first start, iOS 10+ nags you continuously in Settings app), [[Google]], [[Facebook]] etc encouraging/defaulting you to add your cell phone number for auth / recovery reasons).

Also need screenshots from any services that when you add SMS as a second factor, they default to adding SMS as an account recovery method (1-factor), which actually makes your account *LESS SECURE* than if you would have never attempted to turn on [[2FA]] in the first place.

=== Apple ID ===
[[Apple ID]] is a silo identity service that is now (all but?) required to use any [[iOS]] or [[MacOS]] device.

On MacOS, you are prompted by the "Settings" app to associate a phone number that can receive SMS with your Apple ID to "verify your identity":

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]] only allows [[SMS]] based [[MFA]] and then enables SMS recovery as well thus making your account MORE vulnerable (e.g. to SIM-jacking as documented) than if you had never turned on their MFA.

* 2018-07-17 Motherboard: [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin The SIM Hijackers] <blockquote>Certain services, [https://help.instagram.com/566810106808145?helpref=page_content including Instagram], require that users provide a phone number when setting up two-factor, a stipulation with the unintended effect of giving hackers another method of getting into an account. That’s because if hackers take over a target’s number, they can skirt two-factor and seize their Instagram account without even knowing the account’s password.</blockquote>


=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] actually prompts you to add a phone number to your account (if you don't already have one on it) with SMS password reset *as a feature*! They are literally prompting you to make your account *less* secure, while claiming the opposite. WTF.

[[File:2017-09-27-twitter-add-sms-pw-reset-prompt.png]]

Text of prompt reads ('''emphasis''' added): <blockquote><h4>Safeguard your account</h4>Add your phone number now to help ensure that you can log in to Twitter, '''even if you lose your password'''</blockquote>


What the prompt really means: <blockquote><h4>Make your account vulnerable</h4>Add your phone number now to help ensure that anyone pretending to be you to your phone company can log in to Twitter, even without your password'''</blockquote>
