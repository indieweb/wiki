SQRL is the acronym to "Secure Quick Reliable Login".

<blockquote>
SQRL (pronounced “squirrel”) is an open, free, intellectual property unencumbered, complete and practical system to cryptographically authenticate the identity of individuals across a network. Though principally intended for website visitor identification and account sign-in, its concepts may be extended for related applications. SQRL may be used alongside other traditional website sign-in systems, and it can replace all other systems while offering dramatic improvements in usability and security.

Though designed and intended to be a two-party solution – website visitor to website – if needed, SQRL can also be used in a federated third-party mode to provide centralized identity management services to websites (e.g. login.gov).

SQRL supports sign-in on a device containing the SQRL client, and “cross-device” sign-in using a SQRL client on a separate device, such as a smartphone, in the role of secure identity authenticator. SQRL clients currently exist for Windows, Linux/Mac (via WINE), Android, iOS, Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
