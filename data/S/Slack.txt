{{stub}}
'''<dfn>Slack</dfn>''' is a closed-source team communication tool similar to [[IRC]] but with expanding support for various types of content such as emoji polls, inline images, and attachments.

Until 2018, Slack offered the ability to connect to their proprietary system using the open standards [[IRC]] and [[XMPP]], but it was [https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connect-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP announced on March 6 2018] that this support would be phased out, starting immediately and completing on May 15, 2018.

== IndieWeb Slack ==
We have an <span id="IndieWebCamp_Slack">IndieWebCamp Slack</span> team. It has channels for each of our [[IRC]] channels so there is still one "chat room" per subject area whether you use Slack or IRC.

== FAQ ==
=== What is Slackbot ===
<dfn id="Slackbot">Slackbot</dfn> is the bot that appears in Slack.

== Experience ==
People love Slack HQ. They make it clear to see who’s speaking with avatars and whitespace, offset the speaker from the text, make it clear what the person said, and de-emphasize the timestamp and room actions. They also support emoji. Caveat: I’ve never used it, I just know they’re doing something right because people are fanatical about it. — [[User:Chloeweil.com]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE to ===
It may be possible to POSSE [[posts]] to slack, e.g. even [[photo]] posts.

No known IndieWeb Examples of people POSSEing to Slack.

== History ==
The makers of Slack previously made:
* '''<dfn>[https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Glitch&oldid=17528 Glitch]</dfn>''' is a now-defunct game created by the founders of [[Slack]].

This has nothing to do with current [[Glitch]] thing(s).

=== IRC Gateway ===
Slack operated an IRC gateway enabling connecting to a Slack instance from an IRC client. In March 2018 they announced it will be shut down in 2 months.

Note that this does not affect the IndieWeb IRC/Slack bridge, since that uses the Slack API directly to connect our [[IRC]] and Slack channels.
