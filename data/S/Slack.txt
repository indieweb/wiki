'''<dfn>Slack</dfn>''' is a closed-source team communication tool similar to [[IRC]] but with expanding support for various types of content such as emoji polls, inline images, and attachments.

Until 2018, Slack offered the ability to connect to their proprietary system using the open standards [[IRC]] and [[XMPP]], but it was [https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connect-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP announced on March 6 2018] that this support would be phased out, starting immediately and completing on May 15, 2018.

== IndieWeb Slack ==
We have an <span id="IndieWebCamp_Slack">IndieWebCamp Slack</span> team. It has channels for each of our [[discuss|chat]] channels so there is still one "chat room" per subject area whether you use Slack or IRC.

=== Administering Indieweb Slack ===

Slack administrators can [https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/212281478-Customise-member-profiles configure what can be added to a user profile], including (for example) the IndieWeb-compatible websites that a user maintains. 

=== Slack AI ===

On May 16, 2024, we submitted an opt out request for using our Slack org data in training Slack global models, as described [https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/trust/data-management/privacy-principles here].

On May 17, Slack support responded that they have confirmed the opt out request, and provided the following details:

<blockquote>
Thank you for reaching out to Slack support. Your opt-out request has been completed.
 
For clarity, Slack has platform-level machine learning models for things like channel and emoji recommendations and search results. We do not build or train these models in such a way that they could learn, memorize, or be able to reproduce some part of customer data. Our published policies cover those here (https://slack.com/trust/data-management/privacy-principles), and as shared above your opt out request has been processed.
 
Slack AI is a separately purchased add-on that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) but does not train those LLMs on customer data. Slack AI uses LLMs hosted directly within Slack’s AWS infrastructure, so that customer data remains in-house and is not shared with any LLM provider. This ensures that Customer Data stays in that organization’s control and exclusively for that organization’s use. You can read more about how we’ve built Slack AI to be secure and private here: https://slack.engineering/how-we-built-slack-ai-to-be-secure-and-private/.

== FAQ ==
=== What is Slackbot ===
<dfn id="Slackbot">Slackbot</dfn> is the bot that appears in Slack.

== Experience ==
People love Slack HQ. They make it clear to see who’s speaking with avatars and whitespace, offset the speaker from the text, make it clear what the person said, and de-emphasize the timestamp and room actions. They also support emoji. Caveat: I’ve never used it, I just know they’re doing something right because people are fanatical about it. — [[User:Chloeweil.com]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== POSSE to ===
It may be possible to POSSE [[posts]] to slack, e.g. even [[photo]] posts.

No known IndieWeb Examples of people POSSEing to Slack.

== Downtime ==
Notable outages and other downtime for Slack.

The makers of Slack previously made:

This has nothing to do with current [[Glitch]] thing(s).

=== IRC Gateway ===
Slack operated an IRC gateway enabling connecting to a Slack instance from an IRC client. In March 2018 they announced it will be shut down in 2 months.

Note that this does not affect the IndieWeb IRC/Slack bridge, since that uses the Slack API directly to connect our [[IRC]] and Slack channels.
