'''<dfn>[https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-semantic-linkbacks Semantic Linkbacks]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that upgrades the presentation of linkback notifications (like Trackback, Pingback, or Webmention*) from the ugly default pingback presentation of <samp>"[…] random text excerpt […]"</samp> to a much more meaningful and user-friendly display as [[comments]], [[reposts]], [[likes]], and [[favorites]], detected using [[microformats2]] markup from the source of the linkback.

For explicit [[in-reply-to]] [[interactions]], the plugin also changes the WordPress comment type from "<code>webmention</code>" to "<code>comment</code>". Otherwise, it creates human readable whole sentences like "Alice liked this article on alice.example.com." with hyperlinks to the source author and permalink.

== Comment Type Indicator ==
For [[in-reply-to]] interactions, the plugin adds a "type" indicator in the comment metadata for the specific type of interaction:
* [[reply]]
* [[repost]]
* [[like]]
* [[favorite]]
* [[rsvp]]
* [[tag]]
* [[mention]] - Defaults to mention if another type cannot be determined, e.g. "Alice mentioned this article on alice.example.com."

This "type" indicator enables further interaction-specific presentation customization, such as showing likes/favorites and/or reposts as a [[facepile]].

== Configuration == 

No configurable options at this time.

== Extensions ==

If you want to write your own parser for additional markup(such RDFa or Schema.org) you have to hook up the `semantic_linkbacks_commentdata` filter and update the array-fields.

The comment-array is a [http://codex.wordpress.org/get_comment#Return WordPress Comment] with some extra-fields. 

All fields beginning with _ like:
* `$commentdata['_canonical']` for the canonical source url
* `$commentdata['_type']` for the comment type. The plugin currently supports the following types: `mention`(default), `reply`, `repost`, `lik        e`, `favorite`, 'tag', rsvp:yes, rsvp:no, rsvp:maybe, rsvp:invited, rsvp:tracking.
* `$commentdata['_avatar']` for the author avatar
     
...are saved as comment metadata.

== Semantic Comments ==

The [https://github.com/dshanske/semantic-comments Semantic Comments] plugin was an attempt by {{gwg}} to use the type indicator of the Semantic Linkbacks plugin to display mentions as a [[facepile]]. It is not currently maintained.

Semantic Linkbacks has two functions which are wrappers for <code>get_comments</code> you can use in your theme. Both <code>get_linkback()</code> and <code>get_linkback_number()</code> need <code>$type</code> and <code>$post_id</code> passed to the function.

Example:
<code><pre>
<?php 
// Get the global `$wp_query` object.
$id = get_the_ID();
	// Get the semantic_linkbacks_type 'like'.
$comments = get_linkbacks( 'like', $id );
?></pre></code>
Then you can just loop through <code>$comments</code> however you want to markup your [[facepile]].

=== Webmention Plugin ===
<nowiki>*</nowiki>WordPress supports Pingback and Trackback by default; for Webmention support, you must install the separate [[Webmention Plugin]] which is very nicely complementary to the [[Semantic Linkbacks]] plugin.
