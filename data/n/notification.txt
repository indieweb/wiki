'''<dfn>notifications</dfn>''' on the IndieWeb refer to ways a personal site receives, stores, displays, and [[push notification|pushes]] messages indicating something of interest like [[responses]] to posts, [[homepage mentions]], or upcoming [[event]]s &amp; [[RSVP]]s.

From a developer perspective, a web site receives messages indicating something of interest (<dfn id="Server_Notifications">server notifications</dfn>), and displays those messages (preferably in realtime) either in a list on a page, or [[push notification|pushed]] to one or more devices used by the owner of that site (client notifications). Protocols used:
* [[Webmention]]
* [[WebSub]]

== Why ==
There are numerous <span id="Use_Cases">use cases</span> for notifications. Many of these are timely and also use cases for [[push notifications]].

=== Personal use-cases ===
__TOC__
* alarms
* calendar reminders - your site noticing your upcoming [[event]]s and [[RSVP]]s and sending you an event reminder with details inline and URL for more info / comment / option to change RSVP.
* text messages from contacts - your site receives [[indieweb-messaging]] from another site
* social web notifications - potentially every kind of [[webmention]] ‚Äî <br/>'''Warning:''' be careful to avoid creating '''[[notification fatigue]]''' for yourself
** [[follow]] - someone has started [[follow]]ing your [[homepage]] and sent a [[webmention]] accordingly
** [[like]] - someone liked or [[favorite]]d one of your [[posts]] or homepage
** [[comment]] - someone commented on one of your posts
** [[repost]] - someone reposted one of your posts
** [[mention]] - someone wrote a post that mentioned you (via linking to your homepage, perhaps even marked it up as an h-card)
** follow-up comment - someone commented on something you commented on, or liked.
** [[person-tag]] - someone person-tagged you in a [[post]], especially a [[photo]]

=== Public info use-cases ===
* Amber Alert text messages
* Weather alerts per http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/wea.html
* Sports scores (realtime, e.g. World Cup goals)

== Why not ==
<span id="Beware_of">Beware of</span> real world problems occurring in notification systems elsewhere:
=== Too Many Notifications ===
Lists of notifications can be overwhelming, even if they are polled.

Receiving too many notifications can make people not want to use software or services.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== gRegor Morrill ===
{{gRegor}} has a notifications page (currently calling it a "responses" page) at http://gregorlove.com/responses/ since 2016-05.
* Primarily for me to have a quick look at recently-received webmentions + [[local comments]].
* Includes homepage webmentions, though no additional processing is done on them, e.g. [[person-tag]].
* If logged in as an admin, includes webmentions that have not been processed yet and those marked as private, e.g. unapproved local comments
* Currently shows latest 20; may add pagination to go back further.

=== sknebel ===
{{sknebel}} has a private IRC server where a bot (based on [[TikTokBot]] [[https://www.svenknebel.de/posts/2017/8/4/ reports new webmentions]].

=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has a private IRC server where notifications of new webmentions are reported.

[[File:aaronpk-private-irc-notifications.png]]

=== Jeremy Cherfas ===

{{ jeremycherfas }} uses an [https://ifttt.com/applets/59690313d-if-new-feed-item-from-https-granary-demo-appspot-com-url-input-html-output-atom-url-https-3a-2f-2fwebmention-herokuapp-com-2fapi-2fmention IFTTT applet] to monitor the output of [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com] via [https://granary.io/ Granary] to send himself an email whenever his site receives a webmention.

=== Previous Examples ===
==== Aaron Parecki ====
On {{aaronpk}}'s previous website, there was a /mentions page that listed received webmentions in reverse chronological order. The page is archived at http://2015.aaronparecki.com/mentions

[[File:aaronpk-2015-mentions.png|400px]]

==== Ben Roberts ====
{{benthatmustbeme}} had a notifications page at https://ben.thatmustbe.me/activity since 2015-05-07 that shows a summary of all notifications he receives, both to specific posts, and his homepage.

== Design Options == 

For the plaintext representation, displaying the author name is not particularly useful, since people often put random junk into the "name" field. A compromise would be to show the author as "Author Name (url)" in plaintext form.

=== Like or Repost ===

* article: {author} liked "{Article name}" {target url}
* note: {author} liked "{Target post text truncated...}" {target url}
* photo with caption: {author} liked your photo "{Target post text truncated...}" {target url}
* photo no caption: {author} liked your photo {target url}
* {author}, {author}, and 4 others liked (your photo/video) "{Target post text truncated...}" {target url}
* {author} liked a post that linked to "{article name}" {target url}


=== RSVP ===

* {author} RSVPd yes to {target event name} {target url}
* {author} and {author} RSVPd no to {target event name} {target url}
* {author}, {author} and 4 others RSVPd yes to {target event name} {target url}


=== Invite ===

* {invitee} was invited to {target event name} {target url}
* {invitee} and {invitee} were invited to {target event name} {target url}
* {invitee}, {invitee} and 4 others were invited to {target event name} {target url}

=== Generic Mention ===

* {author} linked to {target url}: "Source post text truncated..." {source url}
* {author} and {author} linked to {target url}
* {author} posted "Source post text truncated..." {source url} that linked to {target url}, {target url} and {target url}

=== Reply ===

(not clustered)

* {author} commented on {target url}: "Source post text truncated..." {source url}

=== Clustering ===

In environments with lots of notifications or notification bursts, you may want to cluster notifications together. Here's a description of that feature and the algorithm that [[webmention.io]] uses: [https://snarfed.org/clustering-notifications Clustering notifications].

== Push Notifications ==
{{main|push notification}}

"Push notifications", also known as "<span id="Client_Notifications">client notifications</span>", are notifications that show up on one or more of your client devices without you having to explicitly request them (hence "push").

=== How to ===
{{main|push notification#How_to}}
No replicable indieweb solutions to Push Notifications yet. See the main [[push notification]] page for projects and brainstorming.

=== IndieWeb Push Notification Examples ===
{{main|push_notification#IndieWeb_Examples}}
There are a handful of custom IndieWeb setups for push notifications. See the current list at https://indieweb.org/push_notification#IndieWeb_Examples

== Silo Examples ==
These are examples from various [[silo]]s's websites:

=== Facebook ===
As of 2018, Facebook shows a bell (üîî) icon in their header for notifications, instead of a globe that is rotated to your current location (üåéüåçüåè), on both web and mobile web versions of their site.

(screenshot needed)

Your most recent seven days of [[Facebook]] notifications are available once logged in from:
* https://www.facebook.com/notifications (shorter: fb.com/notifications )
Some of these entries have no permalink and only link to referenced post.  The also appear to be time sensitive and cannot be recovered after a certain amount of time. If you receive Facebook notifications via email you may be able to search your email archives for older notifications.

[[File:facebooknotifications.jpg|800px]]

This screenshot shows Facebook's current notifications UI after browsing to the "Show All Notifications Page" and expanding the notifications menu bar.   Clicking on any notification brings up the post that is being discussed, but there is no known way to get to a post with this exact content"

: "<User> added a new photo" will link directly to a the photo
: "<User> updated her status" will link to the actual status update

Also on the far right are activity from friends on facebook which has some of the same properties though seems to have more post content included in them.

==== Facebook feed files ====
Facebook notifications are also available as feed files!
* RSS: Right-click the blue "RSS" text on top left of fb.com/notifications page (e.g. see above screenshot, the line where it says "Get notifications via:") for the URL. It will look something like:
** <kbd><nowiki>https://www.facebook.com/feeds/notifications.php?id=214611&viewer=214611&key=AlphaNumericKey001&format=rss20</nowiki></kbd> where AlphaNumericKey001 is some key specific to you, security through obscurity as it were.
* JSON: change the "format=rss20" to "format=json" in the RSS URL and you'll get a JSON feed file instead with roughly [[Atom]] semantics.

=== Instagram ===
As of 2017 (or earlier), [[Instagram]] uses a heart (empty by default, filled when chosen) in its bottom bar for "notifications" (since most of their notifications are [[likes]] which they display as hearts). When notifications are available, they show a heart with a dot underneath.
* ‚ô°
* <span style="color:black">‚ô•Ô∏è</span>
* <span style="font-size:2em">‚ù£Ô∏è</span>

(screenshots needed)

Previously, [[Instagram]]'s native apps (iOS, Android) UI (when logged in) has a heart inside a talk bubble icon button at the bottom, which when clicked, presents recent notifications/activity (likes, comments, following, person-taggings) of you and your posts (photos, videos). The "YOU" tab is highlighted in blue by default:

(need screenshot of "YOU" notifications/activity)

If you then tap the "FOLLOWING" tab at the top, it becomes highlighted in blue and shows similar notifications/activity by and for those you follow (for the most part that is, it doesn't show you when people follow the people you are following). 

[[File:2015-023-instagram-like-clustering.jpg]]

=== LinkedIn ===
All notifications are available for a limited amount of time and contain different content than posts
* '''URL and screenshot needed!'''

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] (as of 2017 at least) uses a bell (üîî) icon in the logged in header to link to your notifications page. When you have notifications, a number is shown in a circle on the top right of the bell.

(more screenshots of notifications needed)

[[Twitter]] shows notifications for the logged in user at:
* https://twitter.com/i/notifications
* https://twitter.com/i/notifications?filter=following - particularly useful
Including the following types of [[responses]]:
* [[mentions]] of your username
* [[favorite]]s of your tweets, e.g.
** "Christophe Ducamp and IndieWebCamp favorited your Tweet "
* [[favorite]]s of tweets you're mentioned in, e.g.
** "Kevin Marks favorited a Tweet you were mentioned in "
* [[repost]]s of your tweets, e.g.
** "IndieWebCamp and dietrich ayala retweeted you "
* [[repost]]s of tweets you're mentioned in, e.g.
** "Kevin Marks retweeted a Tweet you were mentioned in "

Twitter's muted notifications filtering options:

'''Mute notifications from people'''
* you don't follow
* who don't follow you
* with a new account
* with a default profile photo
* who haven't confirmed their email
* who haven't confirmed their phone number

...


=== GitHub ===

GitHub shows a blue dot above the notifications icon (a bell) to indicate there are unread notifications.

Notices are divided by project. Each entry shows the title of the issue/PR and an icon indicating what type of action it is (new issue, comment, pull request, PR merged, issue closed). Note/Criticism: there is very rarely enough context on this page to triage notifications &mdash; you almost always have to click through to the issue itself to see what it's referring to.

=== Previous Silo Examples ===
==== Google+ ====
All of a [[Google+]] users own notifications are available from [https://plus.google.com/notifications/all] and can be sorted by "Your posts" or "Other people's posts".  This stream is time sensitive and after all have been read for enough time your notifications box appears empty

<pre>
I fills my heart with glee
Whenever I do see
A starred notification
For the stuff I post here for free.
</pre>
<pre>
There, there and there again
Another notice at the top
Another star from Ben
Part of the notification crop.

It may be fleeting joy
And could just as quickly fade
But for here and now, oh boy!
This special day is made!

== Brainstorming ==
=== Notification Protocol ===
There is evidence of demand from [[IndieAuth]] consumers (clients) e.g. that [https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/3837 Gitea OAuth Github thread], that they want a way to notify such SSO users.

Ideally this would be a formally specified Notification Protocol that could be used by any service to notify users of that service, via the URL they used to identify themselves.

The key building blocks here are:
# the service has a page where it lists notifications for you (see examples above for real world examples of such pages)
# each such notification is itself an [[h-entry]] and has its own permalink
# thus when it is generated, it sends a [[Webmention]] to your identity, in essence, it sends a '''[[person mention]]'''

That process in total (publishing a notification for you at a permalink, then sending a person mention) is a simple Notification Protocol building block that can be implemented by an [[IndieAuth]] consuming service to notify you of anything to do with the service! (thereby eliminating any need to ask you for your email address)

In order to provide some amount of privacy, these notification permalinks could be obscured "capability URLs", public, but unlinked from elsewhere (except your logged-in private notifications page listing them all).

For further privacy enhancement, use a '''[[private-webmention]]''' to send the notification.
