{{stub}}

'''<dfn>nagging</dfn>''' is when a site prompts you out of the blue to go do something for the site, like update your profile.

== Why not ==
Don't do this. Don't nag the user. It's annoying and disrespectful of their time.

== Consent ==

* Cookie checks are in some places mandated. This does not make them any more user-friendly, or less of a nag
* Consent to share your browsing data with advertisers and third parties also form this class of consent nagging.

== Other Examples ==

* "Is this still your phone number?"
* "Do you know these people?"
* "Help us prove you know subject"
* sign-up / pay-wall capture mechanisms
* invite / tag people who can verify you

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] started to display (at least since 2015-07-16) an "Update Your Profile" box and message with a weird flower graphic when you view your own profile if they determine that you should update parts of it (for whatever reason).

Note the absence of a close box or any way of dismissing it.

Here it is in the context of a profile:
