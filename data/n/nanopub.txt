'''<dfn>[https://github.com/dg01d/nanopub nanopub]</dfn>''' is a [[micropub-endpoint]] for use with [[Hugo]] (but should work with any [[static site generator]]) written by {{dgold}}.

Incoming post requests are written to JSON-frontmatter Hugo format and saved to the users content store.

* Currently handles the following indieweb post-types:
** Notes
** Articles
** Replies
** Bookmarks
** Check-Ins

* Supports header and form parameter methods of authentication
* Supports creating posts using `x-www-form-urlencoded` syntax
* Supports updating and deleting posts
* Supports JSON syntax and source content query
* Supports replacement and deletion of properties
* As it uses a separate Media Endpoint it provides configuration query

'''nanopub''' additionally supports syndication of content to external silos. Currently it provides syndication to [[Twitter]] and [[Mastodon]], although it also provides a framework implementation for any modern API-based endpoint. An example is provided of the script pinging the [[micro.blog]] service to update the user's feed.

The code is relatively self-explanatory and documented, and can be adjusted easily to meet different needs.
