{{stub}}

'''<dfn>notification fatigue</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn>alarm fatigue</dfn>, <dfn>alarm saturation</dfn>, or <dfn>needy tech</dfn>) when a person receives so many [[notification]]s that they become unhelpful, interrupt actual work &amp; priorities so much that people start ignoring them; using a [[social reader]] and an IndieWeb site instead of [[silos]] is one way to reduce [[notifications]] and avoid fatigue.


Receiving too many notifications makes people not want to use a client:

** "Everybody is. I'm strongly of the opinion that all this 'needy tech' is a net negative and I try hard to keep it out of my life. But some of it, mostly associated with my kids schooling, is very hard to avoid. 10 emails per week about some school portal with 'an important message' (which you need to separately logged into, of course the message is so important that it can't be entrusted to mere email, even though the account recovery does use that same email) that ends up being nonsense but you're not able to block it because one day an actually important message might show up.<br>Tech should serve us, but meanwhile instead of having terminals to the internet we are now the terminals to the internet. Push notifications and all manner of intrusive interaction have become the norm, not the exception that they should be." [https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jacquesm @jacquesm] October 1, 2023
