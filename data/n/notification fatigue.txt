'''<dfn>notification fatigue</dfn>''' is (AKA <dfn>alarm fatigue</dfn>, <dfn>needy technology</dfn>, <dfn> Alarm Saturation </dfn>) when a person receives so many [[notification]]s that they are no longer helpful, and interrupt actual work so much that the person gets tired of them and starts ignoring them.

Receiving too many notifications makes people not want to use a client:
