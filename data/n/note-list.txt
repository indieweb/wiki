{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>note list</dfn>''' is a common design pattern, like a [[stream]] of short textual messages e.g. tweets/status updates. Often highly time-context sensitive.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* waterpigs.co.uk
* aaronparecki.com

== Silo Examples ==
* Facebook (Web UI)
* Twitter (Web, Mac App)

== Common Denominators ==

There are certain UI elements which are common to most implementations. These include:

* Profile photo (often with rounded corners)
* Full Name (often emboldened)
* Auto–linked URLs, usernames and #tags
* Dates (sometimes relative, almost always the option to see real date)

=== Less Common Elements ===

* As well as the full name, often there’s a network-specific name, or a URL on the indieweb
