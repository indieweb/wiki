'''<dfn>[http://namecoin.info/ Namecoin]</dfn>''' is a [[bitcoin]] fork which was created to handle, buy and manage [[.bit]] decentralized domains.

Pros:
* decentralized
* anonymous

Cons:
* requires mining or buying namecoins
* requires running a daemon to maintain the infrastructure
* See [[#Issues]]

== Issues == 
As of 2015-08, one person controls up to 75% of the compute power on Namecoin, meaning they can effectively control the [[blockchain]]. [https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc16/atc16_paper-ali.pdf]
