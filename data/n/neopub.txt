'''<dfn>neopub</dfn>''' is a blogging software developed by {{robijntje}}. It runs [https://micro.geheimesite.nl micro.geheimesite.nl] and is written in PHP. It has a built-in micropub endpoint and sends webmentions. neopub is inspired by [https://github.com/victoriadrake/neofeed-theme neofeed], [https://p83.nl publog] and [https://aaronparecki.com aaronparecki.com].



''A microblog running neopub can also be called a [[neolog]]''.

== Features ==

neopub has a built-in [[micropub]] endpoint that supports the following post-types:

* [[notes]]
* [[replies]]
* [[bookmarks]]
* [[likes]]
* [[reposts]]

It sends webmentions for all of the above-mentioned post-types. It also supports filtering:

* per year
* per tag
* per post-type

=== Planned ===

These features are planned, but not yet implemented:

* media endpoint to support posting photos
* editing or deleting posts

== Design ==

neopub uses a set of JSON files in the content directory to save posts. These also double as JSON feeds (although I'm not sure whether they are valid). These JSON files are categorized per year. This means every year a new JSON file will be created. 

The RSS feed is dynamically built using the current year's JSON file, as are the homepage and other feed pages. Accessing previous years' posts is possible by using their [[permalink]] or using example.com/posts/2022.

neopub sends webmentions using [https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-php mention-client-php] after a post is published. It receives webmentions using [[webmention.io]] and displays them using a modified version of [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js webmention.js] that can be found in the assets directory. It also has a form to allow users to send manual webmentions.

== Source ==

neopub is open-source and available on [https://github.com/RobinBoers/neopub GitHub] and licensed as Apache License 2.0.

If you want to self-host it, these are the requirements:

* PHP 7.4.3

The main config is in config.php, but you might want to change the theme as well (which can be done by editing the main.css file in the assets directory)
