'''<dfn>neopub</dfn>''' is a blogging software developed by {{robijntje}} that supports indieweb [[building blocks]] [[Micropub]] and [[Webmention]]. It runs [https://micro.geheimesite.nl micro.geheimesite.nl] and is written in PHP. neopub is inspired by [https://github.com/victoriadrake/neofeed-theme neofeed], [https://p83.nl publog] and [https://aaronparecki.com aaronparecki.com].

''A microblog running neopub can also be called a [[neolog]]''.

__TOC__
== Features ==
neopub has a built-in [[micropub]] endpoint that supports the following post-types:

* [[notes]]
* [[replies]]
* [[bookmarks]]
* [[likes]]
* [[reposts]]
* [[photo]]

Images are uploaded to a GitHub repository by default, but you can change what hosting solution you want to use in uploader.php (in the utils directory).

It sends webmentions for all of the above-mentioned post-types. It also supports filtering:

* per year
* per tag
* per post-type

== Design ==
neopub uses a set of JSON files in the content directory to save posts. These also double as JSON feeds (although I'm not sure whether they are valid). These JSON files are categorized per year. This means every year a new JSON file will be created. 

The RSS feed is dynamically built using the current year's JSON file, as are the homepage and other feed pages. Accessing previous years' posts is possible by using their [[permalink]] or using example.com/posts/2022.

neopub sends webmentions using [https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-php mention-client-php] after a post is published. It receives webmentions using [[webmention.io]] and displays them using a modified version of [https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js webmention.js] that can be found in the assets directory. It also has a form to allow users to send manual webmentions.

== Getting started ==
You may self-host neopub for your own microblog. These are the requirements:

* PHP 7.4.3
* Apache (with support for <code>.htaccess</code>)


To self-host neopub:

* Get the [https://github.com/neopublished/neopub source code]

* Edit the main config in <code>config.php</code>

* Copy <code>utils/token_example.php</code> to <code>utils/token.php</code> and enter a GitHub API token. This step is only necessary if you want to upload images to your microblog.

* Install a theme

* Optionally install [https://github.com/neopublished/neoblog neoblog], a simple dashboard for managing settings, themes, and writing notes. '''Keep in mind that it is still a WIP. Use at own risk.'''

== Themes ==

neopub supports theming to some extent. Meaning: you can swap out the <code>main.css</code> file in the <code>assets</code> directory. I made some themes just to experiment. You can browse available themes here: [https://neopublished.github.io/themes https://neopublished.github.io/themes].
