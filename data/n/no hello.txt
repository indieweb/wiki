'''<dfn>[https://nohello.net/ No Hello]</dfn>''' is a philosophy and website encouraging people to “Just ask the question” instead of saying "hi", "yo", "hello", "anyone there?", "you there?" in chat or direct messages (texts or DMs), with several IndieWeb community members encouraging this practice of getting to the point in their own [[communication protocol]]s.
