'''<dfn>[https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net NearlyFreeSpeech]</dfn>''' is a pay-what-you-use [[shared hosting]] service based in the USA. It offers domain registration, DNS, and SSH/shell access with over 25 programming languages, making it a cheap and DIY-friendly environment but not ideal for absolute beginners.

== Services ==

Instead of bundled plans, users are charged for the services they use: [https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/hosting Services] and [https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/pricing pricing] summary.

* shared web hosting for multiple sites
** "non-production" – strictly non-income-generating but may be suitable for resource-light "production" sites
** "production"
** "critical"
* [[SFTP]] and [[SSH]] with access to bash, zsh, and fish shells
* the '''[[programming language]]s''' link on the [https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/ home page] links to a dynamically updated list of available languages and versions
* version control systems: [[git]], [[mercurial]], [[subversion]] ...
* [[personal-domain|domain]] registration with optional privacy
* [[DNS]]
* [[Let's Encrypt]]
* [[email]] forwarding

== Advantages ==

* only pay for what you need/use – can be very cheap for low-traffic and low-resource-intensive sites
* pre-paying means you don't get a bill shock due to an unexpected traffic spike (the [[Reddit]]/Slashdot effect)
* provides shell access and programming languages (more than many other shared hosting providers) and encourages learning and experimentation

== Disadvantages ==

* no one-click/turnkey solutions - users are expected to have the skills to set up their own site or be willing to learn
* pre-paying for individual services means you don't have a predictable monthly bill
