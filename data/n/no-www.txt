* Another reason to setup www. to permanently redirect to your plain domain: apparently (some) browsers hide the www. in the URL bar and when users copy/paste it doesnâ€™t show. Thread: https://twitter.com/mountain_ghosts/status/1284877229449773058
** "really wish browsers would stop hiding parts of domains, esp the 'www.' subdomain. just results in you typing the site you think you're on into another tab or app and it failing" [https://shop.jcoglan.com @mountain_ghosts] July 19, 2020
