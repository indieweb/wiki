{{stub}}

    '''<dfn>no-www</dfn>''' is a movement to deprecate use of "www." at the start of URLs as being redundant, unnecessary, and a waste of resources. Site (until 2016): https://web.archive.org/web/20161102173442/http://no-www.org/.

== Why ==
=== www prefix is a source of bugs ===
* 2023-11-10 [https://ghordano.com/2023/11/10/webmentions-working-wonce-again/ Webmentions Working (W)once Again] <blockquote>I fixed the issue I was having with the WordPress Webmention plugin. I had a hunch that it was being caused by the plugin trying to send webmentions from a '''url with the www prefix'''. Once I changed my site url in my settings to '''not include it''', they started sending again.</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.

== Counterpoints ==

* Another reason to setup www. to permanently redirect to your plain domain: apparently (some) browsers hide the www. in the URL bar and when users copy/paste it doesnâ€™t show. Thread: https://twitter.com/mountain_ghosts/status/1284877229449773058
** "really wish browsers would stop hiding parts of domains, esp the 'www.' subdomain. just results in you typing the site you think you're on into another tab or app and it failing" [https://shop.jcoglan.com @mountain_ghosts] July 19, 2020
