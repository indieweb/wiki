'''<dfn>[https://lab.lunaseeker.com/no/ No-vember]</dfn>''' is a month-long creative web development challenge that takes place each November, where participants create 30 webpages with different constraints or limitations.

== Overview ==

No-vember challenges people to make one webpage each day of November, each with a specific creative constraint. It encourages participants to discover new approaches when certain tools or techniques are unavailable.

The challenge was created by {{zachary.kai}} in 2025.

Participants are encouraged to share their work and document their process throughout the month.

== Guidelines ==

Participants are encouraged to:

* Start with small, single-page projects rather than complete websites
* Document their creative process and discoveries
* Prioritize accessibility in all work
* Share their creations with others
* Adapt the challenge to their needs by skipping days, combining prompts, or creating custom constraints

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{zachary.kai}} will participate in 2025!
