[[Category:Challenge]]

'''<dfn>[https://lab.lunaseeker.com/no/ No-vember]</dfn>''' is a daily [[challenge]] for the month of [[November]] when people create one webpage per day for 30 days, each following a different 'no something' constraint: like 'no color', 'no images', or 'no custom fonts'.

== Overview ==

No-vember challenges people to make one webpage each day of November, each with a specific creative constraint. It encourages participants to discover new approaches when certain tools or techniques are unavailable.

The challenge was created by {{zachary.kai}} in 2025.

== Guidelines ==

Participants are encouraged to:

* Start with small, single-page projects rather than complete websites
* Document their creative process and discoveries
* Prioritize accessibility
* Share their creations with others
* Adapt the challenge to their needs by skipping days, combining prompts, or creating custom constraints

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* {{zachary.kai}} will participate in 2025!
