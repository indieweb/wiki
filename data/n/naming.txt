{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Naming</dfn>''' is hard, yes, even, especially for a personal site since you have to pick both a name you like as a representation of yourself, and one that hasn’t been already taken, though sometimes you can ask nicely (or pay a lot) for [[domain]]s that are registered but unused.

Because it is a general truism, the phrases "[https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/?q=naming+is+hard naming is hard]" or "[https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/?q=names+are+hard names are hard]" are frequently heard in the [[discuss|chat]] when discussing names, especially for products or software. 

Often, coming up with a name for a URL for a new site to represent you isn't easy either.
