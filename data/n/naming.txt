{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Naming</dfn>''' is hard, yes, even, especially for a personal site since you have to pick both a name you like as a representation of yourself, and one that hasn’t been already taken, though sometimes you can ask nicely (or pay a lot) for [[domain]]s that are registered but unused.

Because it is a general truism, the phrases "[https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/?q=naming+is+hard naming is hard]" or "[https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/?q=names+are+hard names are hard]" are frequently heard in the [[discuss|chat]] when discussing names, especially for products or software. 

Often, coming up with a name for a URL for a new site to represent you isn't easy either.

** "Developing Mastodon, I strive to use terminology that is familiar to as many people as possible so as to not put up unnecessary barriers in understanding. For this reason I am happy that we went away from calling posts "toots". It has always been a point of friction for people. Not that I dislike branding, quite the opposite, but in my experience receiving feedback over half a decade, it had a negative effect on the platform for little benefit."
