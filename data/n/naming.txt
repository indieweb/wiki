'''<dfn>Naming</dfn>''' is hard, yes, even, especially for a personal site since you have to pick both a name you like as a representation of yourself, and one that hasnâ€™t been already taken, though sometimes you can ask nicely (or pay a lot) for [[domain]]s that are registered but unused.

Because it is a general truism, the phrases "[https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/?q=naming+is+hard naming is hard]" or "[https://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/?q=names+are+hard names are hard]" are frequently heard in the [[discuss|chat]] when discussing names, especially for products or software. 

Often, coming up with a name for a URL for a new site to represent you isn't easy either.

== Bikeshed ==
A group of people discuss, debate, or arguing about a name of naming is commonly referred to as a <dfn>bikeshed</dfn> or <dfn>bikeshedding</dfn>.

== Naming Considerations ==
=== Branded vs more general names ===
* https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/108352418240054955
** "Developing Mastodon, I strive to use terminology that is familiar to as many people as possible so as to not put up unnecessary barriers in understanding. For this reason I am happy that we went away from calling posts "toots". It has always been a point of friction for people. Not that I dislike branding, quite the opposite, but in my experience receiving feedback over half a decade, it had a negative effect on the platform for little benefit."

** "Itâ€™s pretty simple: Google Meet (original) was previously Meet, which was the rebranded Hangouts Meet. Meet has been merged with Google Duo, which replaced Google Hangouts. Google Duo has been renamed Meet, and Meet has been temporarily named Google Meet (original), for clarity" [http://about.me/tomgara @tomgara] November 2, 2022

== Brainstorming ==
=== Assumptions about names ===
* Thereâ€™s an oft cited article (which ironically lacks citations of its own) about common mistaken assumptions about names (which is likely a mix of actual bad assumptions, and what seems to be made up by the author), whereas it really should cite articles like this: https://www.kron4.com/news/list-of-illegal-baby-names-in-the-united-states-and-around-the-world/
