{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>naming convention</dfn>''' is an explicit pattern or theme used for [[naming]] a set of related and or complementary [[projects]], like the [[p3k naming convention]].

== Why ==
Having a naming convention for the things you make helps provide a sense of connection and relatedness among them, so users of one service or project may feel more comfortable using another.

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== Marty McGuire ===
{{schmarty}}â€™s [[User:Martymcgui.re#Code_/_Services|code & services]] happen to fit into a naming convention which he himself has described as [https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2022-10-25/1666738580568300 cursed].
