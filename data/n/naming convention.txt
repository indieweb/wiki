{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>naming convention</dfn>''' is an explicit pattern or theme used for [[naming]] a set of related and or complementary [[projects]], like the [[p3k naming convention]], focusing on things from a particular theme or names that reflect function, or a hybrid of the two.

== Why ==
Having a naming convention for the things you make helps provide a sense of connection and relatedness among them, so users of one service or project may feel more comfortable using another.

== How to ==
Methods of picking or creating a naming convention:
# '''Particular theme''', like a period of history ([[retro]]), fictional/alternate world/universe (e.g. [[steampunk]]), metaphor (e.g. [[garden]]) and re-use names of objects or fictional characters from that theme
# '''Functional names''', names based on the primary function of the thing
# '''Prefix theme''', pick an overall "brand" and use that as a prefix with generic (common noun) names for the different things

It may be possible to combine elements, e.g. functional names of objects of those specific functions from a particular theme.
