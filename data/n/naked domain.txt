A '''<dfn>naked domain</dfn>''' (also known as a <dfn>root domain</dfn> or <dfn>zone apex</dfn>) is a [[domain name]] (like <kbd>indieweb.org</kbd>) that doesn’t start with “www.” or any other [[subdomain]] and is preferred for IndieWeb sites as identifying yourself starting with W-W-W gets tiresome quickly. Sites that use naked domains can offer '''<dfn>naked URLs</dfn>''' which are shorter than those prefixed with “www.” and thus better [[URL design]].

== Apex technical details ==
The '''zone apex''' is the part of [[DNS]] that contains an the [[SOA]] and [[NS record]]s for a DNS zone.  If you have a site www.example.com, then then the apex is example.com.  The www. portion might be a dedicated host (or load balancer) for serving Web traffic (as opposed to other Internet services. The DNS specification forbids serving a [[naked domain]] with a [[CNAME]] at the apex. Some DNS providers, such as [[CloudFlare]], give the appearance of support for [https://www.isc.org/blogs/cname-at-the-apex-of-a-zone/ CNAME at the apex] by simulating it by [https://blog.cloudflare.com/zone-apex-naked-domain-root-domain-cname-supp/ "CNAME flattening"], which accepts a CNAME in the configuration panel ''as if'' it were allowed, but silently serves up an A record with the correct IP for DNS queries.  Some providers might also call this an ALIAS record, which is not a real DNS record, but the name for the placeholder which uses the same strategy.
