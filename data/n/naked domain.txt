{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>naked domain</dfn>''' is one that isn't prefixed with wwwâ€”or any other [[subdomain]].  Sites that use naked domains can offer '''<dfn>naked URLs</dfn>''', which similarly exclude the subdomain.  Naked URLs are shorter than those prefixed with www and, to some people, more attractive.
