{{stub}}

'''<dfn>no tidy</dfn>''' is an error that you may see at the start of a page from a server using [[PHP]] that depends on the php-tidy extension (like [[H2VX]]) yet does not have the extension installed or enabled; the solution is to install/enable it, e.g. on [[DreamHost]] add "extension = tidy.so" to the serverâ€™s phprc file.
