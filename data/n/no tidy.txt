{{stub}}

'''<dfn>no tidy :(</dfn>''' is an error that you may see at the start of a page from a server using [[PHP]] that depends on the php-[[tidy]] extension (like [[H2VX]]) yet does not have the extension installed or enabled; the solution is to install/enable it, like on [[DreamHost]] add the line <kbd>extension = tidy.so</kbd> to the server’s phprc file.

The server’s phprc file is likely at the path <kbd>~/.php/N.M/phprc</kbd> where <samp>N.M</samp> is the PHP version like <kbd>7.4</kbd> or <kbd>8.0</kbd>.
