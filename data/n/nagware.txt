'''<dfn>nagware</dfn>''' is an [[antipattern]] behavior of web sites when they pop-up a call to action that they want you to take, typically obscuring or even blocking what you were doing, like reading an article. [[registration wall]] and [[login wall]] are examples of nagware, as are the prompts to sign-up for an email newsletter, or install a so-called native app version of the site.

Perhaps the current poster-child for nagware, [[Medium]], as shown in this screenshot has not one but '''three''' nagware modals that in total nearly completely obscure the actual content of the site:

1. Green '''OPEN IN APP''' prompt and modal to switch to reading in an app (when a website works just fine for reading)



2. Read here '''Do not track compliance'''









3. '''[[registration wall]]''' to read one more article
