{{stub}}

'''<dfn>nagware</dfn>''' is an [[antipattern]] behavior of web sites when they pop-up a call to action that they want you to take, typically obscuring or even blocking what you were doing, like reading an article. [[registration wall]] and [[login wall]] are examples of nagware, as are the prompts to sign-up for an email newsletter, or install a so-called native app version of the site.
