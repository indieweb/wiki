'''<dfn>negative reasoning</dfn>''' is a form of deductive prose reasoning that has a negation conditional and a negation result, and is an [[anti-pattern]] because negation conditionals tend to be a misframing, and negation results are rarely actionable, thus rarely productive. Similar, but not as bad, are such statements that include only one or the other (negation conditional OR negation result).

Examples of negative reasoning:
;"You cannot x without y"[https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/648582582083325952]
: Instead: With y you can x

== Examples of negation result only ==
; "I am not convinced x"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-28/line/1443469928060]
; "I am convinced not x"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-09-28/line/1443470015406]
: Instead: I am convinced y
