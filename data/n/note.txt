[[Category:PostType]]
{{emojicon|📔}}
A '''<dfn>note</dfn>''' is a [[post]] that is typically short unstructured* plain text, written & posted quickly, that has its own permalink page.

Creating, publishing, and owning your own notes is a key step towards reducing dependence on [[Twitter]].

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Though <em>unstructured</em> meaning without a heading/title or any other explicit structure, notes can include several lines of text or even lists using "*" or numerical markers due to common [[note#Whitespace|whitespace support]].

== Why ==
Most of the reasons [[why]] apply quite strongly to publishing your [[notes]] on your own website. In addition:
* '''Simplest post building block.''' All [[posts]] have a simple text component, whether name, caption, comment, or text equivalent. Build notes first, and then you have a building block you can build upon for every other post type. This is the smallest step you can take to owning the timestamped content you publish.
* '''Do better than [[Twitter]]''', here are a few ways. Choose those that matter to you:
** '''presentation''': your notes permalink pages can be cleaner and have more informative presentation (e.g. a [[facepile]] of all [[favorites]]/[[retweets]], not just a few) than tweet permalinks
** '''interactivity''': better auto-linking and auto-embedding than proprietary [[Twitter Cards]], multiple embeds instead of just one. E.g. use the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function which works better than Twitter's auto-linking/embedding.
** '''navigation''': providing next/previous and other navigation links
** '''direct linking''': direct hyperlinks rather than t.co wrappers around your links
** '''speed''': load simpler HTML+CSS note pages rather than all of the JS that Twitter depends on.
** '''editability''': you can edit your own notes, you cannot edit tweets.
** '''flexibility''': post notes longer than 140 characters.
__TOC__
== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Here is a minimal note post:
<pre>
<div class="h-entry">
 <time class="dt-published">2013-03-07</time>: 
 <p class="p-content">
  <a class="u-author" href="/">I</a> ate a cheese sandwich.
 </p>
</div>
</pre>
Which might be rendered like:
<blockquote>2013-03-07: I ate a cheese sandwich.</blockquote>

=== How to POSSE ===
The most common [[POSSE]] destination for notes is [[Twitter]] because implementing note posts on your own site is a great way to start to [[own your data]], with posting notes only on your own site, and having it automatically POSSE to Twitter, and never ever posting directly to Twitter again.

See: ''[[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter]]'' for details on How to POSSE notes to Twitter, and replies too!

(need additional note POSSE destinations along with motivations for doing so).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Here are <span id="Documented_Examples">documented examples</span> of IndieWebCamp participants' sites that support publishing notes and do so (i.e. before [[POSSE]]ing to silos). In date order (earliest first) :

== Common Aspects ==
There are certain UI elements which are common to most implementations. These include:

* Profile photo (often with rounded corners)
* Full Name (often emboldened)
* Auto–linked URLs, usernames and #tags
* Dates (sometimes relative, almost always the option to see real date)

=== Autolinking and embedding ===
Various sites/solutions auto-link and/or auto-embed URLs and other linkable things in notes.

recommendations:
* auto-link URLs directly
** even better: if the URL is to a known person, use their name as the link text and perhaps include a small icon of their face before their name.
* auto-link @-names to Twitter profiles
** even better: auto-link @-names to individual's indieweb sites and show their full name instead of Twitter handle. Obviously keep @-names in note content when POSSEing to Twitter.
* auto-embed GIF/JPG/PNG URLs with &lt;img src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed MOV/OGV URLs with &lt;video src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed Youtube URLs with the equivalent Youtube &lt;iframe src> embed (algorithmically convertible)
You can use the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function to do all the above (except the "even better" enhancements) automatically to a piece of plain text.

avoid:
* auto-linking URLs through URLs shorteners (please don't break the web)
* cluttering image/video embeds with extra text (e.g. name/title from destination)

Compare for example:
* '''good original note''': http://tantek.com/2013/054/t2/future-dystopia-beijing-blade-runner
** with autolinked/embedded URLs/images in context of their content location
* '''worse Twitter handling of POSSE'd copy''': https://twitter.com/t/status/305570846796312577
** link shortener wrapping of links
** clumsier image embed - after all tweet text content
** smaller image embed
** undesired extra text
** external site name
** user interface buttons between tweet text and image embed

== Less Common Aspects ==
* username/nickname - as well as the full name, there’s often a silo-specific nickname/alias
* URL to their indieweb home page
* posting application/tool
* posting location - aka geo
* Link text instead of bare URLs. 1/4 of the implementations above have examples of this showing on the first page as of 2014-06-23; names here link to examples: [http://michaelbester.com/notes/Qp7R2 Michael Bester] include the bare URL in addition to or instead of the link text in their syndicated copies. Not sure what [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4WeNxi/ Barnaby Walters] does because the links all appear after the point where the syndicated copy truncates. All of them also use bare URLs.

=== Location ===
[[Location]] (AKA <span id="Geo">[[Geo]]</span>) of notes is somewhat rare and not very well done. Nonetheless, there are questions, use-cases, and examples.

==== Why location ====
'''Why?''' What's the point of posting a note/tweet with location information? (one that's not a checkin)
* What does it do for me (as the user posting it)?
* And what does it do for people reading my notes/tweets? 
* Why is it interesting/useful to anyone?

Related but different: [[checkins]], [[events]], [[photos]] with location.

Here are use-cases for why your notes should support location information:

Use-cases for posting geo / post location information with notes:
* '''location specific service provider help'''
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/320597741485051904
*** "Included there because I wanted @O2IRL to know I was in Ireland"
* '''meetup in non-home city''' - specifically expressing being in the same (non-home) city
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/311161906809421824
* '''explicit I'm not home''' - indication of being in a non-home city
**  https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/316667682877497344 because I was out of town
* '''"help!"''' if you're in trouble - geolocating it would be useful
**  uncommon but urgent use-case.
** though in a "help" situation it's faster to simply *type* where you are etc. than wait for geo location information to come-up, confirm, etc.
*** because geo information is so often "invisible" - it requires extra UI steps to make it work = extra time = not going to do it in an emergency
*** worse - devices get geo information wrong all the time - and having it be wrong in an emergency would be particularly bad
** basically, lack of trust for device geo = not going to use it in a help situation
* if you '''don't know where you are and need help''', then some (even possibly error-prone) geo information may be better than nothing
** but now we're talking quite a bit of an edge case.

==== How To Add Location====
Use the <code>p-location</code> property to markup location information inside an [[h-entry]].

In addition, use [[h-geo]] or [[h-adr]] to markup the details of your location information, whether lat/long coordinates or a structured address, respectively.

==== IndieWeb Location Examples ====
See [[location#Indieweb_examples]].

==== Silo location examples ====
Silo examples can be useful for research purposes and to help inform indieweb design.

===== Tweet with location =====

Live example:
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248

Problems:
* '''artificial precision''' - Twitter in particular links names of cities like "Paris, Paris" <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> to a Google map with lat/long of 8 decimal digits precision!
** e.g. https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248 <blockquote>I didn't mean "x,y" I meant "Paris" - aaronpk on [[IRC]]</blockquote>

Past Example when Twitter used to show a map on tweet permalinks of the location:
* http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/7771330904/

=== Space characters ===
{{main|space#Space_characters_in_text}}
<span id="Whitespace">Space characters</span> are often entered into text posting UIs, and more and more preserved when presented, and when exported or edited.

Typical [[silo]] notes implementations display most space characters written in their posting interfaces. IndieWeb implementations should preserve space characters also.

See the [[space]] page for more details, IndieWeb Examples, Silo Examples, and further brainstorming.

==== Indieweb space characters thinking ====
{{main|space#Indieweb_space_characters_thinking}}
Summary: IndieWeb implementations would have to preserve space characters in posting UI to storage to display round-trips. See below for presentation details.

Two options for publishers:
# Use <code>p-content</code> if you expect only the plain text of your post to be retrieved, and then (preferably, but possibly only optionally) have its white-space preserved.
# Use <code>e-content</code> if you publish fully marked up links, embeds, and whitespace (e.g. with <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>, <code>&nbsp;</code> etc.) and expect whitespace in source to be collapsed per HTML parsing rules.

When presenting space characters implementations should:
* Do '''&lt;br/> substitutions''' - Indieweb implementations could (are any already?) automatically insert <code>&lt;br></code> tags for linebreak space characters (a kind of [[auto-space]], similarly to auto-linking URLs in notes). In addition, there would need to be an approach to handling multiple sequential space characters, and leading spaces on a line.
* Substitute multiple sequential inline space characters to &amp;nbsp; if that behavior is really desired (I've never needed/wanted to preserve multiple spaces in a note) [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 18:14, 20 August 2015 (PDT)
* Two more [[auto-space]] cases (pretty sure this should take care of mimicking pre-wrap behavior - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]])
*# line-break then inline space: turn the inline space into an <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>
*# sequence of inline spaces: turn every adjacent pair into <code>_&amp;nbsp;</code> (where _ represents a inline space character)
* [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_space()</code> now implements this, and live on tantek.com

== Subtypes ==
Since notes are such a ubiquitous content posting type (Thanks to [[Twitter]]), it's no surprise that subtypes of notes are evolving for representing additional structure or types of information. Let's document them as they emerge.

=== Health Fitness Tracking ===
{{main|exercise}}
Tags: fitbit, pedometer, physical activity

Challenges:
* Too much hassle (AKA "high friction data collection") http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/10/28/1/low-friction-personal-data-collection

==== Step Tracking ====

Syntax: number-of-steps #steps anything-extra

Examples:

* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes?tagged=steps

==== BMI Tracking ====

Syntax: number #bmi

Examples:

* http://evan.status.net/tag/bmi

=== microsyntax and picoformats ===
{{main|microsyntax}}

'''<dfn>[[microsyntax]]</dfn>''' and '''<dfn id="Picoformats">picoformats</dfn>''' are broader efforts to briefly and readably structure information in pure/plain text form.

See:
* [[microsyntax#Brainstorming]] in particular for thoughts on how to represent additional types of posts as text in notes.
* http://microformats.org/wiki/picoformats for more historical research and documentation.

== Note Display ==
When displaying a note, it is customary to just display the note content and no explicit note title.

While this is fairly straightforward for a site itself (which often has its own post type information, perhaps even as an additional class name on the h-entry like <code>h-as-note</code>), for sites that display [[h-entry]]s from elsewhere it helps to have an algorithm to determining when is a note a note and should thus be displayed as such.

=== Note Type Algorithm ===
Summary: if the name of the h-entry is essentially the content of the entry, it's a note, just display the content (and no explicit name/title).

Algorithm for a parsed [[h-entry]]

* set the tname to trim(name)
* set the tcontent to trim(content)
* if the tname == tcontent, then it's a note, return.
* if the tname ends with an ellipsis ("..." or "…") then 
** drop the ellipsis character
** if the tname is a prefix of tcontent, then it's a note, return
* otherwise it's not a note

Implementations:
* [[mf2util]] function <code>is_name_a_title</code> can be used for this purpose. If it returns false, then you know it's a note.

=== Displaying Whitespace ===
Since there are two ways [[note#IndieWeb_Whitespace_Examples|indieweb sites post notes with whitespace]] (namely whitespace characters vs whitespace markup), when code that consumes such notes displays them, they should handle both methods.

This rough heuristic may work:
* if the note only has p-content, then [[auto-link]] it and use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> to display it
* else (if note has e-content HTML)
** if content HTML has line-breaks AND DOES NOT have any <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags inside
** then use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> to display it
* end if

== Origin ==
The origin (or at least inspiration for this page) of the use of the term "note" for a brief text post without name or title is from the [[Activity Streams 1.0]] Object Type Schema: 
* https://activitystrea.ms/head/activity-schema.html#note

== FAQ ==
Questions about notes, implementing them, publishing them.
=== markdown or plain text ===
Q: As an implementer of notes on my own website, should I store [[markdown]] or just plain text and autolink/autoembed everything?

A: Typical implementations store '''plain text''' for notes and use an autolinker/embedder to create links and embedded images. E.g.:
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which stores all notes as plain text entry-content inside an h-entry in a flat file.
* ... add your implementation example here.

See also: [[storage]].

=== how long should notes be ===
Q: As an implementer, what's the maximum size I should allow for notes?

A: Up to you and your own site needs! Typical implementations do not have note length limitations.
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which has no explicit lenght limitation on notes, however as part of the publishing UI shows what will be [[POSSE]]d to Twitter and how many characters are remaining to do so without having to elide the text.
* ... add your implementation example here.

=== how to display in a list  ===
Q: When displaying a list of [[h-entry]] notes, e.g. in [[comments-presentation]] on a post, or in an indie [[reader]], when should the name, or name+content, or just content be displayed?

A: See [[notes#Note_Display|notes display]] for how to determine when to use a name or name+content and what to display accordingly.

=== Including a p-name in a note ===
Q: Why should you put a p-name in a note? It seems uselessly redundant.

A: You probably don't. Some Feed Readers may have problems with title-less content because their UI assumes a title will always exist. This is in part because the RSS & Atom standards both required a title in all item/entry elements, even though many readers would still function correctly if one wasn't supplied.

* Avoid fake titles / post names like "No Title": https://indieweb.social/@janboddez/109727368077775910
** "You should probably not add “No Title” to your titleless “IndieWeb” notes. Even if your site’s front end doesn’t show these “titles,” your RSS feed still might. Which would cause feed readers to display these notes as “articles,” i.e., _with_ a title (equal to “No Title”).#indieweb(https://bddz.be/Db1)" [https://indieweb.social/@janboddez @janboddez] January 21, 2023

Historically in the 2010-2011 timeframe, [[Google Buzz]] and [[Google Reader]] (both long since defunct) displayed content with no title to as blank entries in a list. This advice is no longer relevant, and notes should not have a p-name.
