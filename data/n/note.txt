[[Category:PostType]]
{{emojicon|ðŸ“”}}
A '''<dfn>note</dfn>''' is a [[post]] that is typically short unstructured* plain text, written & posted quickly, that has its own permalink page.

Creating, publishing, and owning your own notes is a key step towards reducing dependence on [[Twitter]].

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Though <em>unstructured</em> meaning without a heading/title or any other explicit structure, notes can include several lines of text or even lists using "*" or numerical markers due to common [[note#Whitespace|whitespace support]].

== Why ==
Most of the reasons [[why]] apply quite strongly to publishing your [[notes]] on your own website. In addition:
* '''Simplest post building block.''' All [[posts]] have a simple text component, whether name, caption, comment, or text equivalent. Build notes first, and then you have a building block you can build upon for every other post type. This is the smallest step you can take to owning the timestamped content you publish.
* '''Do better than [[Twitter]]''', here are a few ways. Choose those that matter to you:
** '''presentation''': your notes permalink pages can be cleaner and have more informative presentation (e.g. a [[facepile]] of all [[favorites]]/[[retweets]], not just a few) than tweet permalinks
** '''interactivity''': better auto-linking and auto-embedding than proprietary [[Twitter Cards]], multiple embeds instead of just one. E.g. use the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function which works better than Twitter's auto-linking/embedding.
** '''navigation''': providing next/previous and other navigation links
** '''direct linking''': direct hyperlinks rather than t.co wrappers around your links
** '''speed''': load simpler HTML+CSS note pages rather than all of the JS that Twitter depends on.
** '''editability''': you can edit your own notes, you cannot edit tweets.
** '''flexibility''': post notes longer than 140 characters.

== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Here is a minimal note post:
<pre>
<div class="h-entry">
 <time class="dt-published">2013-03-07</time>: 
 <p class="p-name p-content">
  <a class="u-author" href="/">I</a> ate a cheese sandwich.
 </p>
</div>
</pre>
Which might be rendered like:
<blockquote>2013-03-07: I ate a cheese sandwich.</blockquote>

=== How to POSSE ===
The most common [[POSSE]] destination for notes is [[Twitter]] because implementing note posts on your own site is a great way to start to [[own your data]], with posting notes only on your own site, and having it automatically POSSE to Twitter, and never ever posting directly to Twitter again.

See: '''[[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter]]'' for details on How to POSSE notes to Twitter, and replies too!

(need additional note POSSE destinations along with motivations for doing so).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Here are <span id="Documented_Examples">documented examples</span> of IndieWebCamp participants' sites that support publishing notes and do so (i.e. before [[POSSE]]ing to silos). In date order (earliest first) :

She previously published notes inconsistently via [[WordPress]] beginning in November 2017. Notes are automatically cross-posted from Micro.blog to [[Twitter]] and [[Tumblr]].

=== Past Examples ===
Past examples of indieweb note posting, either offline or otherwise no longer working:
* <span id="Brennan_Novak">[[User:Brennannovak.com|Brennan Novak]]</span> on brennannovak.com since 2010-07-17 (<nowiki>https://brennannovak.com/notes/1</nowiki> - 404 since at least 2018-02-17).
* <span id="Sandeep_Shetty">[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]</span> using [[Converspace]] on sandeep.io since 2012-11-05 (<nowiki>http://www.sandeep.io/1</nowiki> - 404 since at least 2018-02-17).

== Common Aspects ==
There are certain UI elements which are common to most implementations. These include:

* Profile photo (often with rounded corners)
* Full Name (often emboldened)
* Autoâ€“linked URLs, usernames and #tags
* Dates (sometimes relative, almost always the option to see real date)

=== Autolinking and embedding ===
Various sites/solutions auto-link and/or auto-embed URLs and other linkable things in notes.

recommendations:
* auto-link URLs directly
** even better: if the URL is to a known person, use their name as the link text and perhaps include a small icon of their face before their name.
* auto-link @-names to Twitter profiles
** even better: auto-link @-names to individual's indieweb sites and show their full name instead of Twitter handle. Obviously keep @-names in note content when POSSEing to Twitter.
* auto-embed GIF/JPG/PNG URLs with &lt;img src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed MOV/OGV URLs with &lt;video src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed Youtube URLs with the equivalent Youtube &lt;iframe src> embed (algorithmically convertible)
You can use the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function to do all the above (except the "even better" enhancements) automatically to a piece of plain text.

avoid:
* auto-linking URLs through URLs shorteners (please don't break the web)
* cluttering image/video embeds with extra text (e.g. name/title from destination)

Compare for example:
* '''good original note''': http://tantek.com/2013/054/t2/future-dystopia-beijing-blade-runner
** with autolinked/embedded URLs/images in context of their content location
* '''worse Twitter handling of POSSE'd copy''': https://twitter.com/t/status/305570846796312577
** link shortener wrapping of links
** clumsier image embed - after all tweet text content
** smaller image embed
** undesired extra text
** external site name
** user interface buttons between tweet text and image embed

== Less Common Aspects ==
* username/nickname - as well as the full name, thereâ€™s often a silo-specific nickname/alias
* URL to their indieweb home page
* posting application/tool
* posting location - aka geo
* Link text instead of bare URLs. 1/4 of the implementations above have examples of this showing on the first page as of 2014-06-23; names here link to examples: [http://tommorris.org/posts/8996 Tom Morris] and [http://michaelbester.com/notes/Qp7R2 Michael Bester] include the bare URL in addition to or instead of the link text in their syndicated copies. Not sure what [http://www.sandeep.io/186 Sandeep Shetty] does because the example doesn't link to a syndicated copy; not sure what [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4WeNxi/ Barnaby Walters] does because the links all appear after the point where the syndicated copy truncates. All of them also use bare URLs.

=== Location ===
[[Location]] (AKA <span id="Geo">[[Geo]]</span>) of notes is somewhat rare and not very well done. Nonetheless, there are questions, use-cases, and examples.

==== Why location ====
'''Why?''' What's the point of posting a note/tweet with location information? (one that's not a checkin)
* What does it do for me (as the user posting it)?
* And what does it do for people reading my notes/tweets? 
* Why is it interesting/useful to anyone?

Related but different: [[checkins]], [[events]], [[photos]] with location.

Here are use-cases for why your notes should support location information:

Use-cases for posting geo / post location information with notes:
* '''location specific service provider help'''
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/320597741485051904
*** "Included there because I wanted @O2IRL to know I was in Ireland"
* '''meetup in non-home city''' - specifically expressing being in the same (non-home) city
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/311161906809421824
* '''explicit I'm not home''' - indication of being in a non-home city
**  https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/316667682877497344 because I was out of town
* '''"help!"''' if you're in trouble - geolocating it would be useful
**  uncommon but urgent use-case.
** though in a "help" situation it's faster to simply *type* where you are etc. than wait for geo location information to come-up, confirm, etc.
*** because geo information is so often "invisible" - it requires extra UI steps to make it work = extra time = not going to do it in an emergency
*** worse - devices get geo information wrong all the time - and having it be wrong in an emergency would be particularly bad
** basically, lack of trust for device geo = not going to use it in a help situation
* if you '''don't know where you are and need help''', then some (even possibly error-prone) geo information may be better than nothing
** but now we're talking quite a bit of an edge case.

==== How To Add Location====
Use the <code>p-location</code> property to markup location information inside an [[h-entry]].

In addition, use [[h-geo]] or [[h-adr]] to markup the details of your location information, whether lat/long coordinates or a structured address, respectively.

==== IndieWeb Location Examples ====
See [[location#Indieweb_examples]].

==== Silo location examples ====
Silo examples can be useful for research purposes and to help inform indieweb design.

===== Tweet with location =====

Live example:
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248

Problems:
* '''artificial precision''' - Twitter in particular links names of cities like "Paris, Paris" <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> to a Google map with lat/long of 8 decimal digits precision!
** e.g. https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248 <blockquote>I didn't mean "x,y" I meant "Paris" - aaronpk on [[IRC]]</blockquote>

Past Example when Twitter used to show a map on tweet permalinks of the location:
* http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/7771330904/

=== Whitespace ===
(Please help consolidate this section into '''[[space]]''', and keep a summary here about the brainstorming, as well as summarize consensus conclusions and document them in "How To" sub-sections above)

Typical [[silo]] notes implementations display most whitespace written in their posting interfaces. IndieWeb implementations should preserve whitespace also.
==== Why Preserve Whitespace ====
There are some interesting use cases to preserving white space, in particular line breaks. 

Besides the obvious use-cases of poetry, paragraphs, and lists, there is for example, chess games (and moves!)

* https://twitter.com/alapapa/status/312053522755641344

This leads us to the use case of '''indieweb spectator [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess correspondence chess]'''. That is, two players could play a chess game just by posting moves on their own indieweb sites as replies to each others' moves.

Perhaps chess moves (and resulting board state) could be posted as a special kind of [[note]] [[post]] type (a game-move or game-turn?) and then [[POSSE]]'d to Twitter with whitespace intact. 

If the move is response to a move on another indiewebsite, then in addition to using [[webmention]] for move completion notification, the POSSE'd response move could also indicate with Twitter's in-reply-to-status-id the POSSE'd tweet of the previous move. See [[comment#POSSE_a_comment|how to POSSE a comment]]/[[in-reply-to]]/[[u-syndication]] for details of how to do this.

Such public posting of moves would also allow for anyone to jump in and attempt to play a next move by posting a reply move. The player of the previous move would then receive multiple webmentions and could decided which move (or both) to reply to in turn.

==== Indieweb whitespace thinking ====
Due to the expectations set by dominant [[silo]] implementations, any note authoring/composing UI should preserve line-breaks, blank lines, and multiple space characters when writing/authoring, displaying/presenting, and ideally, when syndicating ([[POSSE]]ing, e.g. whitespace preserved by POSSE via [[Twitter]] API, Twitter->FB cross-posting / downstream-POSSEing, [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/446 and Bridgy Publish]).

Especially now that even Twitter has set consistent expectations from its posting UI, there's a strong case that a user switching from Twitter to an indieweb note posting UI would expect whitespace and linebreaks to "just work".

Summary, two options for publishers:
# Use <code>p-content</code> if you expect only the plain text of your post to be retrieved, and then (preferably, but possibly only optionally) have its white-space preserved.
# Use <code>e-content</code> if you publish fully marked up links, embeds, and whitespace (e.g. with <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>, <code>&nbsp;</code> etc.) and expect whitespace in source to be collapsed per HTML parsing rules.

More analysis:

Obviously indieweb implementations would have to preserve white-space in posting UI to storage to display round-trips. Then in the presentation they could either:
* a. '''&lt;br/> substitutions''' - Indieweb implementations could (are any already?) automatically insert <code>&lt;br></code> tags for linebreak whitespaces (a kind of [[auto-space]], similarly to auto-linking URLs in notes). In addition, there would need to be an approach to handling multiple sequential space characters, and leading spaces on a line.
** Substitute multiple sequential space characters to &amp;nbsp; if that behavior is really desired (I've never needed/wanted to preserve multiple spaces in a note) [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 18:14, 20 August 2015 (PDT)
** Two more [[auto-space]] cases (pretty sure this should take care of mimicking pre-wrap behavior - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]])
**# line-break then space: turn the space into an <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>
**# sequence of spaces: turn every adjacent pair into <code>_&amp;nbsp;</code> (where _ represents a space)
** Update: [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_space()</code> now implements this, and live on tantek.com
* b. '''white-space:pre-wrap''' - Alternatively indieweb implementations should use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> similar to how Twitter does.
** As of 2015-08-24 tweet permalinks (e.g. [https://twitter.com/t/status/634507922157006854]) have markup for hyperlinks, but use <code>&amp;#10;</code> for linebreaks, instead of <code><nowiki><br/></nowiki></code>.
** -1 This is a strange divergence from expected HTML with the big disadvantage that consumers need to implement post-type detection to check if a post is a note and/or heuristics to infer whether whitespace in a post is meaningful. As an implementer of a reader that consumes lots of different posts from different sources, I would much prefer that e-content whitespace be consistent between sources and post types. [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 18:14, 20 August 2015 (PDT)
*** e-content consistency is a good argument. perhaps white-space preservation with white-space:pre-wrap should only be applied to a plain p-content "value", and if there is any e-content, even if just via [[auto-link]]ing, it should [[auto-space]] as well. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 16:41, 24 August 2015 (PDT)

History:
* b. white-space:pre-wrap seemed to be the logical choice for indieweb implementations
** However, it became clear that doing just "some" auto-markup (e.g. [[autolink]] and [[autoembed]] but not [[autospace]]) was too (unnecessarily) hard for consuming code (e.g. readers, other sites) to have a chance at getting right.
** After more brainstorming, [[autospace]] algorithms and code were figured out and seem to be working fine, thus the approach documented in a) made more sense.

==== IndieWeb Whitespace Examples ====
* '''tantek.com''' [[Falcon]] [[notes]] as of 2013-105 (retroactively supported in storage & styling back to 2013-001) preserve whitespace, present it, and [[POSSE]] it to [[Twitter]] which then preserves the whitespace when copying it to [[Facebook]], e.g.:

* '''kylewm.com''' [[Red Wind]] [[notes]] are just articles without a title. So they are processed by Markdown which converts whitespace to HTML.
** Example post with linebreaks: https://kylewm.com/2016/05/i-think-this-is-great-feedback-for-known-and-the

* '''gregorlove.com''' notes are also just articles without a title. http://ma.tt/scripts/autop/ is used to convert 2+ new line characters to paragraphs and single new line characters to line breaks.
** Example: http://gregorlove.com/2015/08/revisiting-imogen-heaps-speak/

* '''kartikprabhu.com''' using [[Bundle]]; [[notes]] are authored as plain-text, and white-space is preserved on display using CSS <code>white-space: pre-wrap</code>. Example: https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/like-wed-design-100-years
* '''snarfed.org''' uses HTML tags to represent meaningful whitespace. The HTML itself has plenty of meaningless whitespace in both note and non-note posts. This is generally true of all [[WordPress]] sites. [https://kylewm.com/services/mf2?url=https://snarfed.org/2015-07-13_14722 Example.] (search for the content property containing ''I often sign off on code reviews''...)
* '''aaronparecki.com''' uses white-space:pre-wrap on notes with significant white-space, e.g.

* '''veganstraightedge.com''' [[Dark Matter]] [[notes]] have whitespace preserved using [[Ruby on Rails]]' <code>simple_format()</code> function which converts new lines ("\n") to <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.

==== Silo Whitespace Examples ====
===== Facebook =====
[[Facebook]] status updates are notes (no post title) that preserve sequential space characters and line breaks.
===== Google =====
[[Google+]] posts are similarly just notes (no post title) that also preserve sequential space characters and line breaks.
===== Twitter =====
[[Twitter]] now has multiple implementations that preserve white space characters in presentation:
* '''Twitter.com''' (as of ~2013-03-13)[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57574167-93/twitter-adds-line-breaks-and-gets-hit-with-the-ugly-stick/][http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/twitter-line-breaks/][http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/twitter-linebreaks/][http://smallbiztrends.com/2013/03/twitter-line-breaks.html][http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/what-are-twitter-line-breaks-good-for/]

* View Source: The linebreaks are encoded as <code>&amp;#10;</code> character entitites, without any visible line breaks in the code.
* View Selection Source (FF) and Inspect Element (FF, Safari): The linebreaks appear to be simple "carriage return" characters (<code>\r</code>, ASCII 13), showing visible line breaks in the code.
* In either case, the visual presentation of the whitespace characters is achieved using CSS: <blockquote style="white-space:pre"><code><nowiki>.js-tweet-text {
    white-space: pre-wrap;
}</nowiki></code></blockquote>

== Subtypes ==
Since notes are such a ubiquitous content posting type (Thanks to [[Twitter]]), it's no surprise that subtypes of notes are evolving for representing additional structure or types of information. Let's document them as they emerge.

{{main|microsyntax}}

'''<dfn>[[microsyntax]]</dfn>''' and '''<dfn id="Picoformats">picoformats</dfn>''' are broader efforts to briefly and readably structure information in pure/plain text form.

See:
* [[microsyntax#Brainstorming]] in particular for thoughts on how to represent additional types of posts as text in notes.
* http://microformats.org/wiki/picoformats for more historical research and documentation.

== Note Display ==
When displaying a note, it is customary to just display the note content and no explicit note title.

While this is fairly straightforward for a site itself (which often has its own post type information, perhaps even as an additional class name on the h-entry like <code>h-as-note</code>), for sites that display [[h-entry]]s from elsewhere it helps to have an algorithm to determining when is a note a note and should thus be displayed as such.

=== Note Type Algorithm ===
Summary: if the name of the h-entry is essentially the content of the entry, it's a note, just display the content (and no explicit name/title).

Algorithm for a parsed [[h-entry]]

* set the tname to trim(name)
* set the tcontent to trim(content)
* if the tname == tcontent, then it's a note, return.
* if the tname ends with an ellipsis ("..." or "â€¦") then 
** drop the ellipsis character
** if the tname is a prefix of tcontent, then it's a note, return
* otherwise it's not a note

Implementations:
* [[mf2util]] function <code>is_name_a_title</code> can be used for this purpose. If it returns false, then you know it's a note.

=== Displaying Whitespace ===
Since there two ways [[note#IndieWeb_Whitespace_Examples|indieweb sites post notes with whitespace]] (namely whitespace characters vs whitespace markup), when code that consumes such notes displays them, they should handle both methods.

This rough heuristic may work:
* if the note only has p-content, then [[auto-link]] it and use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> to display it
* else (if note has e-content HTML)
** if content HTML has line-breaks AND DOES NOT have any <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags inside
** then use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> to display it
* end if

== FAQ ==
Questions about notes, implementing them, publishing them.
=== markdown or plain text ===
Q: As an implementer of notes on my own website, should I store [[markdown]] or just plain text and autolink/autoembed everything?

A: Typical implementations store '''plain text''' for notes and use an autolinker/embedder to create links and embedded images. E.g.:
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which stores all notes as plain text entry-content inside an h-entry in a flat file.
* {{kylewm}} on [https://kylewm.com kylewm.com] stores all notes in Markdown. I like to include light styling (like italics) in my notes, and let lower fidelity copies go out to Twitter. I do run an autolink step to link @-names and bare URLs.
* ... add your implementation example here.

=== how long should notes be ===
Q: As an implementer, what's the maximum size I should allow for notes?

A: Up to you and your own site needs! Typical implementations do not have note length limitations.
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which has no explicit lenght limitation on notes, however as part of the publishing UI shows what will be [[POSSE]]d to Twitter and how many characters are remaining to do so without having to elide the text.

=== how to display in a list  ===
Q: When displaying a list of [[h-entry]] notes, e.g. in [[comments-presentation]] on a post, or in an indie [[reader]], when should the name, or name+content, or just content be displayed?

A: See [[notes#Note_Display|notes display]] for how to determine when to use a name or name+content and what to display accordingly.

=== Including a p-name in a note ===
Q: Why should you put a p-name in a note? It seems uselessly redundant.

A: Some Feed Readers may have problems with title-less content because their UI assumes a title will always exist. This is in part because the RSS and Atom standards both required a title in all item/entry elements, even though many readers would still function correctly if one wasn't supplied. For instance, circa 2010-2011, Google Buzz and Google Reader cause content with no title to show up as blank entries in a list.
