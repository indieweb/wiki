[[Category:PostType]]
{{emojicon|📔}}
A '''<dfn>note</dfn>''' is a [[post]] that is typically short unstructured* plain text, written & posted quickly, that has its own permalink page.

Creating, publishing, and owning your own notes is a key step towards reducing dependence on [[Twitter]].

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Though <em>unstructured</em> meaning without a heading/title or any other explicit structure, notes can include several lines of text or even lists using "*" or numerical markers due to common [[note#Whitespace|whitespace support]].

== Why ==
Most of the reasons [[why]] apply quite strongly to publishing your [[notes]] on your own website. In addition:
* '''Simplest post building block.''' All [[posts]] have a simple text component, whether name, caption, comment, or text equivalent. Build notes first, and then you have a building block you can build upon for every other post type. This is the smallest step you can take to owning the timestamped content you publish.
* '''Do better than [[Twitter]]''', here are a few ways. Choose those that matter to you:
** '''presentation''': your notes permalink pages can be cleaner and have more informative presentation (e.g. a [[facepile]] of all [[favorites]]/[[retweets]], not just a few) than tweet permalinks
** '''interactivity''': better auto-linking and auto-embedding than proprietary [[Twitter Cards]], multiple embeds instead of just one. E.g. use the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function which works better than Twitter's auto-linking/embedding.
** '''navigation''': providing next/previous and other navigation links
** '''direct linking''': direct hyperlinks rather than t.co wrappers around your links
** '''speed''': load simpler HTML+CSS note pages rather than all of the JS that Twitter depends on.
** '''editability''': you can edit your own notes, you cannot edit tweets.
** '''flexibility''': post notes longer than 140 characters.
__TOC__
== How to ==
=== How to publish ===
Here is a minimal note post:
<pre>
<div class="h-entry">
 <time class="dt-published">2013-03-07</time>: 
 <p class="p-content">
  <a class="u-author" href="/">I</a> ate a cheese sandwich.
 </p>
</div>
</pre>
Which might be rendered like:
<blockquote>2013-03-07: I ate a cheese sandwich.</blockquote>

=== How to POSSE ===
The most common [[POSSE]] destination for notes is [[Twitter]] because implementing note posts on your own site is a great way to start to [[own your data]], with posting notes only on your own site, and having it automatically POSSE to Twitter, and never ever posting directly to Twitter again.

See: '''[[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter]]'' for details on How to POSSE notes to Twitter, and replies too!

(need additional note POSSE destinations along with motivations for doing so).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Here are <span id="Documented_Examples">documented examples</span> of IndieWebCamp participants' sites that support publishing notes and do so (i.e. before [[POSSE]]ing to silos). In date order (earliest first) :

== Common Aspects ==
There are certain UI elements which are common to most implementations. These include:

* Profile photo (often with rounded corners)
* Full Name (often emboldened)
* Auto–linked URLs, usernames and #tags
* Dates (sometimes relative, almost always the option to see real date)

=== Autolinking and embedding ===
Various sites/solutions auto-link and/or auto-embed URLs and other linkable things in notes.

recommendations:
* auto-link URLs directly
** even better: if the URL is to a known person, use their name as the link text and perhaps include a small icon of their face before their name.
* auto-link @-names to Twitter profiles
** even better: auto-link @-names to individual's indieweb sites and show their full name instead of Twitter handle. Obviously keep @-names in note content when POSSEing to Twitter.
* auto-embed GIF/JPG/PNG URLs with &lt;img src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed MOV/OGV URLs with &lt;video src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed Youtube URLs with the equivalent Youtube &lt;iframe src> embed (algorithmically convertible)
You can use the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function to do all the above (except the "even better" enhancements) automatically to a piece of plain text.

avoid:
* auto-linking URLs through URLs shorteners (please don't break the web)
* cluttering image/video embeds with extra text (e.g. name/title from destination)

Compare for example:
* '''good original note''': http://tantek.com/2013/054/t2/future-dystopia-beijing-blade-runner
** with autolinked/embedded URLs/images in context of their content location
* '''worse Twitter handling of POSSE'd copy''': https://twitter.com/t/status/305570846796312577
** link shortener wrapping of links
** clumsier image embed - after all tweet text content
** smaller image embed
** undesired extra text
** external site name
** user interface buttons between tweet text and image embed

== Less Common Aspects ==
* username/nickname - as well as the full name, there’s often a silo-specific nickname/alias
* URL to their indieweb home page
* posting application/tool
* posting location - aka geo
* Link text instead of bare URLs. 1/4 of the implementations above have examples of this showing on the first page as of 2014-06-23; names here link to examples: [http://michaelbester.com/notes/Qp7R2 Michael Bester] include the bare URL in addition to or instead of the link text in their syndicated copies. Not sure what [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4WeNxi/ Barnaby Walters] does because the links all appear after the point where the syndicated copy truncates. All of them also use bare URLs.

=== Location ===
[[Location]] (AKA <span id="Geo">[[Geo]]</span>) of notes is somewhat rare and not very well done. Nonetheless, there are questions, use-cases, and examples.

==== Why location ====
'''Why?''' What's the point of posting a note/tweet with location information? (one that's not a checkin)
* What does it do for me (as the user posting it)?
* And what does it do for people reading my notes/tweets? 
* Why is it interesting/useful to anyone?

Related but different: [[checkins]], [[events]], [[photos]] with location.

Here are use-cases for why your notes should support location information:

Use-cases for posting geo / post location information with notes:
* '''location specific service provider help'''
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/320597741485051904
*** "Included there because I wanted @O2IRL to know I was in Ireland"
* '''meetup in non-home city''' - specifically expressing being in the same (non-home) city
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/311161906809421824
* '''explicit I'm not home''' - indication of being in a non-home city
**  https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/316667682877497344 because I was out of town
* '''"help!"''' if you're in trouble - geolocating it would be useful
**  uncommon but urgent use-case.
** though in a "help" situation it's faster to simply *type* where you are etc. than wait for geo location information to come-up, confirm, etc.
*** because geo information is so often "invisible" - it requires extra UI steps to make it work = extra time = not going to do it in an emergency
*** worse - devices get geo information wrong all the time - and having it be wrong in an emergency would be particularly bad
** basically, lack of trust for device geo = not going to use it in a help situation
* if you '''don't know where you are and need help''', then some (even possibly error-prone) geo information may be better than nothing
** but now we're talking quite a bit of an edge case.

==== How To Add Location====
Use the <code>p-location</code> property to markup location information inside an [[h-entry]].

In addition, use [[h-geo]] or [[h-adr]] to markup the details of your location information, whether lat/long coordinates or a structured address, respectively.

==== IndieWeb Location Examples ====
See [[location#Indieweb_examples]].

==== Silo location examples ====
Silo examples can be useful for research purposes and to help inform indieweb design.

===== Tweet with location =====

Live example:
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248

Problems:
* '''artificial precision''' - Twitter in particular links names of cities like "Paris, Paris" <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> to a Google map with lat/long of 8 decimal digits precision!
** e.g. https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248 <blockquote>I didn't mean "x,y" I meant "Paris" - aaronpk on [[IRC]]</blockquote>

Past Example when Twitter used to show a map on tweet permalinks of the location:
* http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/7771330904/

=== Space characters ===
{{main|space#Space_characters_in_text}}
<span id="Whitespace">Space characters</span> are often entered into text posting UIs, and more and more preserved when presented, and when exported or edited.

Typical [[silo]] notes implementations display most space characters written in their posting interfaces. IndieWeb implementations should preserve space characters also.

See the [[space]] page for more details, IndieWeb Examples, Silo Examples, and further brainstorming.

==== Indieweb space characters thinking ====
{{main|space#Indieweb_space_characters_thinking}}
Summary: IndieWeb implementations would have to preserve space characters in posting UI to storage to display round-trips. See below for presentation details.

Two options for publishers:
# Use <code>p-content</code> if you expect only the plain text of your post to be retrieved, and then (preferably, but possibly only optionally) have its white-space preserved.
# Use <code>e-content</code> if you publish fully marked up links, embeds, and whitespace (e.g. with <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>, <code>&nbsp;</code> etc.) and expect whitespace in source to be collapsed per HTML parsing rules.

When presenting space characters implementations should:
* Do '''&lt;br/> substitutions''' - Indieweb implementations could (are any already?) automatically insert <code>&lt;br></code> tags for linebreak space characters (a kind of [[auto-space]], similarly to auto-linking URLs in notes). In addition, there would need to be an approach to handling multiple sequential space characters, and leading spaces on a line.
* Substitute multiple sequential inline space characters to &amp;nbsp; if that behavior is really desired (I've never needed/wanted to preserve multiple spaces in a note) [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 18:14, 20 August 2015 (PDT)
* Two more [[auto-space]] cases (pretty sure this should take care of mimicking pre-wrap behavior - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]])
*# line-break then inline space: turn the inline space into an <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>
*# sequence of inline spaces: turn every adjacent pair into <code>_&amp;nbsp;</code> (where _ represents a inline space character)
* [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_space()</code> now implements this, and live on tantek.com

== Subtypes ==
Since notes are such a ubiquitous content posting type (Thanks to [[Twitter]]), it's no surprise that subtypes of notes are evolving for representing additional structure or types of information. Let's document them as they emerge.

=== Health Fitness Tracking ===

Examples:

* http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes?tagged=steps

==== BMI Tracking ====

Syntax: number #bmi

Examples:

* http://evan.status.net/tag/bmi

=== microsyntax and picoformats ===
{{main|microsyntax}}

'''<dfn>[[microsyntax]]</dfn>''' and '''<dfn id="Picoformats">picoformats</dfn>''' are broader efforts to briefly and readably structure information in pure/plain text form.

See:
* [[microsyntax#Brainstorming]] in particular for thoughts on how to represent additional types of posts as text in notes.
* http://microformats.org/wiki/picoformats for more historical research and documentation.

== Note Display ==
When displaying a note, it is customary to just display the note content and no explicit note title.

While this is fairly straightforward for a site itself (which often has its own post type information, perhaps even as an additional class name on the h-entry like <code>h-as-note</code>), for sites that display [[h-entry]]s from elsewhere it helps to have an algorithm to determining when is a note a note and should thus be displayed as such.

=== Note Type Algorithm ===
Summary: if the name of the h-entry is essentially the content of the entry, it's a note, just display the content (and no explicit name/title).

Algorithm for a parsed [[h-entry]]

* set the tname to trim(name)
* set the tcontent to trim(content)
* if the tname == tcontent, then it's a note, return.
* if the tname ends with an ellipsis ("..." or "…") then 
** drop the ellipsis character
** if the tname is a prefix of tcontent, then it's a note, return
* otherwise it's not a note

Implementations:
* [[mf2util]] function <code>is_name_a_title</code> can be used for this purpose. If it returns false, then you know it's a note.

=== Displaying Whitespace ===
Since there are two ways [[note#IndieWeb_Whitespace_Examples|indieweb sites post notes with whitespace]] (namely whitespace characters vs whitespace markup), when code that consumes such notes displays them, they should handle both methods.

This rough heuristic may work:
* if the note only has p-content, then [[auto-link]] it and use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> to display it
* else (if note has e-content HTML)
** if content HTML has line-breaks AND DOES NOT have any <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags inside
** then use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> to display it
* end if

== FAQ ==
Questions about notes, implementing them, publishing them.
=== markdown or plain text ===
Q: As an implementer of notes on my own website, should I store [[markdown]] or just plain text and autolink/autoembed everything?

A: Typical implementations store '''plain text''' for notes and use an autolinker/embedder to create links and embedded images. E.g.:
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which stores all notes as plain text entry-content inside an h-entry in a flat file.
* ... add your implementation example here.

See also: [[storage]].

=== how long should notes be ===
Q: As an implementer, what's the maximum size I should allow for notes?

A: Up to you and your own site needs! Typical implementations do not have note length limitations.
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which has no explicit lenght limitation on notes, however as part of the publishing UI shows what will be [[POSSE]]d to Twitter and how many characters are remaining to do so without having to elide the text.
* ... add your implementation example here.

=== how to display in a list  ===
Q: When displaying a list of [[h-entry]] notes, e.g. in [[comments-presentation]] on a post, or in an indie [[reader]], when should the name, or name+content, or just content be displayed?

A: See [[notes#Note_Display|notes display]] for how to determine when to use a name or name+content and what to display accordingly.

=== Including a p-name in a note ===
Q: Why should you put a p-name in a note? It seems uselessly redundant.

A: You probably don't. Some Feed Readers may have problems with title-less content because their UI assumes a title will always exist. This is in part because the RSS and Atom standards both required a title in all item/entry elements, even though many readers would still function correctly if one wasn't supplied. For instance, circa 2010-2011, Google Buzz and Google Reader cause content with no title to show up as blank entries in a list. This advice is mostly no longer relevant, and notes should not have a p-name.
