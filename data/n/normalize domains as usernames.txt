'''<dfn>Normalize domains as usernames</dfn>''' is the idea that we should encourage and expect more people and services to use [[domain]]s as usernames, instead of usernames that are local to a single service and don't have any meaning or use outside of that service.

Web sites are the most obvious example, with the easiest way to access them. Just type a domain into your browser's address bar, and you'll go to that person's web site!

Social networks and services are starting to use domains internally as their own usernames. [[micro.blog]] has been doing it for years. More recently, [[Bluesky]] is now doing it too.

The new user signup flow is a critical pattern here. If a services uses domains as its usernames, it should ideally include [[domain registration]] as part of its signup flow, make it just as easy as other services, and crucially handle any [[DNS]] setup behind the scenes, without requiring users to know DNS at all.
