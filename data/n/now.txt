'''A <dfn>[http://nownownow.com/about now page]</dfn>''' is a [[page]] on a personal website that tells you what a person is focused on at the current time, day, or very recently.

Ephemeral [[story]] posts are often about what someone is doing now.

If you’re looking for what projects people are working on currently, see:
* '''[[projects]]'''

== Why ==
The now page "movement" was initiated by [http://sivers.org/ Derek Sivers] in a sense to fill the gap between the common "[[About]] Page" and regular status updates on services like Twitter and Facebook.

<blockquote>It’s useful for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your site: because people on your site want to know more about you.

Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities. By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other requests.</blockquote>

These "now" examples are more like "recently" pages with information updated within the past month or so:
* {{colinwalker}} added a [https://colinwalker.blog/now now page] on 2017-05-10

* {{chrisaldrich}} has had a regularly updated [http://boffosocko.com/now/ now page] since 2016-06-13

== Other Examples ==
=== Wikipedia ===
[[Wikipedia]]’s home page essentially serves as their "now" page with a few features:
* "today's featured article"
* [[on this day]]

== Services ==
=== nownownow ===
[https://nownownow.com/ nownownow] is a collection of sites with a /now page.

The main page at https://nownownow.com/about encourages people to practice several IndieWeb [[principles]] including own their own domain and post their own content.

Those who register their now page on the [https://nownownow.com/about Now site] and who have a Twitter account will receive [https://twitter.com/nownownow @mentions on Twitter] every few months in part as an advertisement for the service, but also as a reminder to the user to update their Now page.

== Criticism ==
=== Additional work ===
Much like side files, a static Now page (just like an [[about|about page]]) requires additional work to regularly update and therefore isn't very [[DRY]] (aka Don't Repeat Yourself).

<blockquote>One node of resistance pushing against my keeping a Now page is the felt emphasis on immediacy. Perhaps it’s more perception than reality, but Now feels different than Recently or Lately, which trace a bit longer arc of activity. I want to meld mindfulness & deliberation. --[https://micro.blog/schuth/920869 William Schuth on 2018-09-27]</blockquote>

=== Never updated ===
"now" pages feel like something a lot of people set up but never update


== Brainstorming ==
=== home automated do not disturb ===
* {{JackyAlcine}} is considering tying integrations from his home automation setup to toggle a "Do Not Disturb" mode on his site. Things like an active [[watch]] post can be used to alert the site to a "Jacky's busy right now, please don't disturb" state.

=== when is an event now ===
* Dev tip: when displaying events that are happening "now", use the oldest possible value of "now", in UTC-12. If this is only for events you personally are attending, then use your own current timezone to determine "now".

=== aggregating now pages ===
Brainstorm: a "now" page aggregator that answers the question of what is everyone up to? Perhaps with clustering of overlapping activities, media being consumed (same books, movies, music), or events being attended

* https://aboutideasnow.com/?filter=now does a simple/incremental version of this, listing various "now" page updates as separate cards
* useful improvements:
** subset of contacts — only folks you know/met
** clustering of overlapping activities as noted in description
