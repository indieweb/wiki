A '''<dfn>name</dfn>''' can be an important part of one's online [[identity]] and can be almost anything one chooses to represent themselves. 

While some may choose to use pseudonyms, nick names, pen names, ''noms de guerre'', their legal names, creative typography (maybe [[File:Prince_logo.svg|frameless|12px|alt=Logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar|The unpronounceable symbol (later dubbed "Love Symbol #2")]]?), only a first name, or just a last name, since it's your website, it is up to you choose your own name, or even none at all, as part of your online representation.
